		<title>Arrest rates fall</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As drug use rises, arrest rates will rise proportionately – right?

Apparently, wrong. The federal government’s National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports that, as of 2013, marijuana use has risen 57 percent since 2007, but over that same period, the FBI Uniform Crime Report recorded that marijuana possession arrests fell 21 percent.

As the Washington Post reports, "The net effect of these two trends is a 50 percent drop in marijuana enforcement intensity, from roughly one arrest for every 2,900 days of use in 2007 to about one arrest for every 5,800 days of use in 2013."

The question that remains is, of course, why? While the answer can only ever really be speculative, marijuana policy expert Dr. Beau Kilmer of the RAND Corporation suggests “the increasing legal protections offered by medical marijuana laws and the decriminalization of possession in California" among the possible factors.

Drug policy reform advocates continually point out the undo burden of minor drug possession arrests and charges on the judicial system, and marijuana legalization advocates note the spurious, if not outright refutable, relationship between marijuana and crime, as well as the long-cherished popular belief that marijuana acts as a "gateway drug." (See a thorough assessment of the relationship between marijuana use, possession arrest rates, crime and incarceration rates, and hard drug use rates from NORML here.)

In fact, the anticorrelation between marijuana use and possession arrest rates seem to further underscore the tidal shift in social opinion – not only are, presumably, more people comfortable reporting their own occasional, even daily, marijuana use (and we can assume that at least some of the increase in use rates are attributable to more honest reporting from users); but perhaps the police are also less inclined to arrest for something considered more and more to be a victimless and wholly nonthreatening crime – and one that, many would argue, shouldn't be a crime at all.]]></content:encoded>

<h4>Mission Statement</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">

Devoted to a higher purpose and the well-being of the medical marijuana community, the Apothecary’s mission is to create a positive cannabis culture in Nevada. The Apothecary Shoppe plans to emphasize guest experience and wellness by matching patients to flower, concentrate, syrups, and edibles best suited for a particular taste or need, to provide accessibility to licensed physicians, and to raise the standard by which cannabis dispensaries should be measured.

<div class="panel-heading">
<h4>Unique Attribute</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">

Because the Apothecary Shoppe is physician-owned, they plan to research cannabis. Currently, Dr. Spirtos is conducting a study to research the effects of a THC:CBD syrup he has developed specifically for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Now open for enrollment, the study will determine whether THC:CBD syrup will control nausea and vomiting in patients using chemotherapy. Should you be interested in participating, please call the Apothecary Shoppe.

<h4>Staff Education</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">

“We offer our concierges physician-directed training with myself as well as the dispensary’s general manager and other physicians,” explained Dr. Spirtos, owner of the Apothecary Shoppe, who added, “that the concierges will be in training until we are comfortable with their progress. We literally walk our concierges through 1,100 papers and base their education off of the actual literature.”

In addition, Dr. Spirtos and his colleagues emphasize the importance of getting each patient’s medical history and finding out what medications they are taking in order to take cross-reactions into consideration. They also work with patients to make adjustments. “We give them a dose and see where it goes and work with them until we find something that works,” Dr. Spirtos relayed of the patient care offered at the dispensary.

<h4>Design of space</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">

Featuring cabinetry and woodwork crafted by locally skilled artisans, the Apothecary Shoppe offers an upscale and impeccably stylish environment that reminded us of a cigar lounge. But the proprietors had another inspiration. “We wanted it to reflect a turn-of-the-century pharmacy with both its warmth and local feel. The goal was to convey how people felt going into their local pharmacist,” explained Dr. Spirtos. “We didn’t want it to feel like an Apple store or smoke shop. Frankly, having grown up in the desert, when you go to a place with a lot of wood it is extra warm and that was the whole idea behind the dispensary’s design.”

		<title>FORGETTING THE FEAR AND UNDERSTANDING THE FACTS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Riana Durrett</h4>
<p>Sometimes when I’m getting ready for work in the morning or on a drive across town, I find myself making a mental list of everything in the world that needs to be fixed when suddenly a fear washes over me: What if marijuana becomes legal on November 8th and more and more kids start using it? What if it becomes popular among kids and they get desensitized to it and start doing more serious drugs? As the Executive Director of Nevada Dispensary Association and supporter of Question Two, am I on a trajectory to increase marijuana use among children? </p>
<p>Each time I have this internal debate, I come back to all the reasons I support legalizing marijuana: </p>
<p>1. Marijuana is currently used by teenagers and even younger children at an alarming rate. 
2. It is the unwarranted fear of the slippery slope that has kept a substance less harmful than alcohol illegal for so long.
3. We can do better at reducing youth use of marijuana by removing marijuana from the black market, where kids are currently purchasing it.   
</p>
<p>I am a mom of two young boys and have a niece who lives with me every summer. Like all moms, I am concerned about drug use in our country and will do anything to protect my kids from experiencing the struggles so many Americans face when it comes to drug use. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, "in 2012, 13.2 percent of youths aged 12 to 17 indicated that they had been approached by someone selling drugs in the past month."1 Peers have such a strong influence over youth that a better indicator of whether a teenager will start smoking is whether their friends smoke, rather than whether their parents smoke.2</p>
<p>But, naturally, there are two sides to the coin if Question Two passes. One benefit is that adults over the age of 21 will be able to use marijuana with myriad benefits to the State and our communities. Benefits include tax money moving into the State’s economy as well as into education and conservation of criminal justice resources that should go towards more serious crimes. In addition, citizens, such as veterans who fear losing their federal benefits, will have access to marijuana for medical treatment without being required to register with the State. </p>
<p>An extensive report released by RCG Economics and the Marijuana Policy Group estimates that the state will receive a total of $464 million in the first seven years of legalization, which breaks down to $257.4 million in sales and use tax, $147.1 million in excise tax, $47.2 million in license fees, $3.5 million in application fees, $521,000 in Nevada Commerce Tax and $8.3 million in payroll tax. </p>
<p>The other side of the coin is that the marijuana industry and Nevadans must promote adult-only use of marijuana and we must embrace the opportunity to reduce use of marijuana by our youth, with the possibility of this reduction extending to other substances. With more than 47 percent of Americans having tried marijuana in their lifetime, there is no denying that the prohibition on marijuana is a policy that has failed in the United States.3</p>
<p>So, what is the real impact of legalizing marijuana and what are the real opportunities? </p>
<p>In June of this year, the Nevada Dispensary Association organized a trip to Denver, Colorado for legislators, regulators and leaders from Nevada’s medical marijuana industry. Senator Patricia Farley of District 8 was in attendance and put her focus on youth prevention, funding for drug treatment and the impact of legalized marijuana on public health. </p>
<p>It never occurred to me before that trip that legalized marijuana could provide an opportunity to improve overall public health in Nevada and not just reduce black market sales of marijuana. Senator Farley approached the trip with just that goal in mind. When describing her efforts Farley said, “How can Nevada harness the opportunities legalized marijuana provides to not just reduce black market sales of marijuana, but to raise youth awareness, reduce drug use among youth, and increase resources for drug treatment?” </p>
<p>Prior to the trip to Denver, I was unaware that Nevada’s schools have no uniform drug awareness program. With the D.A.R.E. program found to be ineffective, shouldn’t we be trying to reach our youth and prevent drug abuse through some other program throughout the State?4 Of course, as parents we are all responsible for our own children, but our children are involved in a larger community and that community is lacking in public awareness, youth prevention, and drug abuse treatment. I am eagerly awaiting the 2017 Legislative Session when Senator Farley pursues support for youth prevention and drug treatment programs, which could potentially be funded from the economic boon resulting from Question Two’s passage.  </p>
<p>Senator Farley is confident that if the youth prevention measure she is sponsoring passes during the upcoming legislative session, Nevada will lead the nation in its efforts to prevent youth from using marijuana and much more harmful substances.</p>
<p>“I have spent the better part of the year speaking with elected officials and leaders from other states, as well as educators, to gather information on the best approach to youth prevention,” explained Senator Farley. “With the help of Roseman University and John Hudak, a fellow with Brookings Mountain West, Nevada is going to go from having absolutely no youth prevention program for our children to having the best in the nation.” </p>
<p>So, the next time the fear starts to creep in and I start to wonder if my work with the Nevada Dispensary Association is tantamount to working for Philip Morris, I will think of two pieces of news I received recently that reminded me legalizing recreational marijuana is an affront to drug abuse and drug addiction. First, a study was released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which concluded that marijuana use among teenagers is currently decreasing, while the number of states legalizing marijuana is increasing. This is supported by a Health Kids Survey commissioned by the State of Colorado that concluded that youth use decreased by 2-3 percent once marijuana was legalized. </p>
<p>The second piece of news that confirms to me that legalizing marijuana is the right thing to do is that the producer of Fentanyl recently made a large campaign contribution to oppose marijuana legalization. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid painkiller that is up to 50 times more potent than heroin. Disturbingly, a synthetic form of this painkiller has been illegally produced and laced into heroine in the past and is now being sold on its own. Why would the producer of a painkiller (the real painkiller, not the synthetic one available on the street) be opposed to legalizing marijuana?   </p>
<p>If anyone asks me, as a mother, if I support legalizing marijuana, my answer is unequivocally: Yes. As a mother, an aunt, an attorney, a Nevadan and as the Executive Director of Nevada Dispensary Association, I will vote in favor of passing Question Two. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Riana Durrett</h4>
<p>Sometimes when I’m getting ready for work in the morning or on a drive across town, I find myself making a mental list of everything in the world that needs to be fixed when suddenly a fear washes over me: What if marijuana becomes legal on November 8th and more and more kids start using it? What if it becomes popular among kids and they get desensitized to it and start doing more serious drugs? As the Executive Director of Nevada Dispensary Association and supporter of Question Two, am I on a trajectory to increase marijuana use among children? </p>
<p>Each time I have this internal debate, I come back to all the reasons I support legalizing marijuana: </p>
<p>1. Marijuana is currently used by teenagers and even younger children at an alarming rate. 
2. It is the unwarranted fear of the slippery slope that has kept a substance less harmful than alcohol illegal for so long.
3. We can do better at reducing youth use of marijuana by removing marijuana from the black market, where kids are currently purchasing it.   
</p>
<p>I am a mom of two young boys and have a niece who lives with me every summer. Like all moms, I am concerned about drug use in our country and will do anything to protect my kids from experiencing the struggles so many Americans face when it comes to drug use. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, "in 2012, 13.2 percent of youths aged 12 to 17 indicated that they had been approached by someone selling drugs in the past month."1 Peers have such a strong influence over youth that a better indicator of whether a teenager will start smoking is whether their friends smoke, rather than whether their parents smoke.2</p>
<p>But, naturally, there are two sides to the coin if Question Two passes. One benefit is that adults over the age of 21 will be able to use marijuana with myriad benefits to the State and our communities. Benefits include tax money moving into the State’s economy as well as into education and conservation of criminal justice resources that should go towards more serious crimes. In addition, citizens, such as veterans who fear losing their federal benefits, will have access to marijuana for medical treatment without being required to register with the State. </p>
<p>An extensive report released by RCG Economics and the Marijuana Policy Group estimates that the state will receive a total of $464 million in the first seven years of legalization, which breaks down to $257.4 million in sales and use tax, $147.1 million in excise tax, $47.2 million in license fees, $3.5 million in application fees, $521,000 in Nevada Commerce Tax and $8.3 million in payroll tax. </p>
<p>The other side of the coin is that the marijuana industry and Nevadans must promote adult-only use of marijuana and we must embrace the opportunity to reduce use of marijuana by our youth, with the possibility of this reduction extending to other substances. With more than 47 percent of Americans having tried marijuana in their lifetime, there is no denying that the prohibition on marijuana is a policy that has failed in the United States.3</p>
<p>So, what is the real impact of legalizing marijuana and what are the real opportunities? </p>
<p>In June of this year, the Nevada Dispensary Association organized a trip to Denver, Colorado for legislators, regulators and leaders from Nevada’s medical marijuana industry. Senator Patricia Farley of District 8 was in attendance and put her focus on youth prevention, funding for drug treatment and the impact of legalized marijuana on public health. </p>

<p>Senator Farley is confident that if the youth prevention measure she is sponsoring passes during the upcoming legislative session, Nevada will lead the nation in its efforts to prevent youth from using marijuana and much more harmful substances.</p>
<p>“I have spent the better part of the year speaking with elected officials and leaders from other states, as well as educators, to gather information on the best approach to youth prevention,” explained Senator Farley. “With the help of Roseman University and John Hudak, a fellow with Brookings Mountain West, Nevada is going to go from having absolutely no youth prevention program for our children to having the best in the nation.” </p>
<p>So, the next time the fear starts to creep in and I start to wonder if my work with the Nevada Dispensary Association is tantamount to working for Philip Morris, I will think of two pieces of news I received recently that reminded me legalizing recreational marijuana is an affront to drug abuse and drug addiction.

<p>The second piece of news that confirms to me that legalizing marijuana is the right thing to do is that the producer of Fentanyl recently made a large campaign contribution to oppose marijuana legalization. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid painkiller that is up to 50 times more potent than heroin.

Why would the producer of a painkiller (the real painkiller, not the synthetic one available on the street) be opposed to legalizing marijuana?   </p>
<p>If anyone asks me, as a mother, if I support legalizing marijuana, my answer is unequivocally: Yes. As a mother, an aunt, an attorney, a Nevadan and as the Executive Director of Nevada Dispensary Association, I will vote in favor of passing Question Two. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The marijuana industry is going legit and right along with it is Tommy Chong. </p>
<p>Chong, who became an iconic figure in the marijuana movement as a result of starring in the Cheech & Chong movie franchise made popular in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, has used his movie fame to go straight just as the entire cannabis industry is also becoming legal.</p>
<p>Known best for embodying the antics of one of two potheads who became the poster boys for stoner culture, Chong is now enjoying a new adventure in the cannabis industry. It’s a journey that has resulted from an experience with illness that is no laughing matter. Ironically, what was once fodder for both a comedy routine and the premise of an entire catalog of movies has aided Chong in both overcoming the challenges of cancer and starting a career as a cannabis entrepreneur. </p>

<h3>THINGS ARE TOUGH ALL OVER</h3>
<p>Diagnosed with prostate and rectal cancer, Chong began medical treatment for both in 2014. Chong had been diagnosed with prostate cancer a few years earlier but was told it was very slow growing and wouldn’t require aggressive treatment. “Unfortunately I ended up contracting rectal cancer, too, and that’s when I got real serious. </p>
<p>“I did radiation and chemo and had the operation, and that took about a couple of months. I got the operations, they closed off the rectal on me and they equipped me with a colostomy bag, which I named Donald Trump, by the way, so it’s apropos because it’s always full of hot air and shit,” quipped Chong, who clearly has not lost his sense of humor. </p>
<p>In addition to traditional cancer treatments, Chong also used cannabis. “I will tell you where the pot really came into play,” explained Chong. “After the operation I lost about 30 lbs. and I was down to under 140 lbs. and at my age that’s not healthy. I got out of the hospital and I got home. My gorgeous wife told me to go smoke some weed. I smoked some bud, some really nice medical sativa and that night I remember it so clear because I woke up and I was hungry and I hadn’t had an appetite because the oxycontin and other drugs take away your appetite. If you don’t have an appetite and you are older, that’s the first sign of death.</p>
<p>“I hobbled to the refrigerator, opened the frig door and I was hungry. I had some roast chicken and I just ate. The high got me thinking comedic thoughts again. Like, for instance, going to the refrigerator in the middle of the night like stoners do and from that moment on, every time I would get miserable, I would go smoke a little bit. Then I started rehabbing myself by smoking because when you get high, you start having all of these creative thoughts.”</p>
<p>Not only did Chong use cannabis to find his creativity again, but he also found it aided in his cancer recovery. “My span of cancer treatment was about a year. I did the operation, chemo pills and radiation, they radiated the prostate area, they didn’t have to remove it. With me, I still got the equipment. It’s coming back a little bit at a time. After the operation I started injecting cannabis oil into the muscle. I did the injections for about two weeks, it made me feel much better.</p>
<p>“I went to the oncologist about two weeks ago for an MRI as a follow-up because I got off the chemo and other treatments and I am totally clean. I beat it in a year,” reported Chong of his newly diagnosed cancer-free status. </p>
<p>Chong attributes being cancer-free to a combination of both the traditional medical treatments he received and cannabis. “It’s the way the pot affects the brain; that is the most important thing because it calms the brain and puts you to sleep. It gets you really stoned and being really stoned is slowing brain activity down to a crawl so that you are almost a vegetable. But that’s what they do for people who are really sick, they put them in medically induced comas to help them recover.”</p>
<p>Prior to his use of cannabis for cancer, Chong was unaware of the medicinal properties of the plant. “Unfortunately I didn’t know. Had I known that, I would have been, when I went to prison, I would have been smoking it,” explained Chong, who spent nine months in prison in 2003 for selling glass pipes and bongs across state lines. “I got offered a lot of pot and then I would get drug tested so I actually quit smoking for almost three years while I was in the court system. Then a couple of years after I got out of prison, I got diagnosed with prostate cancer so I think that my not smoking it had a lot to do with me getting cancer. That’s just my theory.”</p>


<h3>STILL SMOKIN’</h3>
<p>With this theory in mind, Chong decided to create Chong’s Choice, a line of cannabis products that the actor-turned-businessman says is innately medical. “We look at our product like it is all medical. They talk about recreational, but to me all pot use is medical. If it comes from Chong’s Choice, it’s medical.” </p>
<p>The Chong’s Choice line of products includes oil cartridges, THC strips (infused breath strip), flower, and pre-rolls that are currently sold in Arizona, California, Colorado, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Chong’s Choice will be launched in the Nevada market on November 8 at Shango Las Vegas where Chong will introduce hybrid, indica and sativa flower and shatter product lines.</p>
<p>“We contact growers that grow the best,” explained Chong of how he determines the flower used in Chong’s Choice. “We find out who the best growers are in different areas and we form a partnership and as long as they are providing us with a topnotch product, they are part of the Chong’s Choice family. We guarantee the product, the high quality.” </p>
<p>Chong and the team at Chong’s Choice concern themselves with the methods that the growers use when deciding who they will work with. “We want to make sure there’s no poison on the plant and no poison in the fertilizer. The truth is if you use the right techniques, you will have superior bud but you have to make sure the water is clean, the environment is clean, and that the workers know what they are doing.</p>
<p>AWe are dealing with a medical substance and so it has to be topnotch in order to be effective.”</p>

<h3>NICE DREAMS</h3>
<p>“If you look at the Cheech and Chong history, the message was always there. It’s subliminal but it’s there. It was a conscious decision on my part. If I was going to represent a stoner, I wanted people to see a guy who worked out with weights, and ate healthy,” Chong continued, “my message has always been either blatant or subliminal humor, I always promoted humor with marijuana, no one ever got hurt in our movies, there was no greed factor involved, if anything it was what pot does to you. It makes you forget certain things like your name. That’s why it worked hand in hand it wasn’t...I wasn’t really surprised, we weren’t rebels in a sense, we were missionaries.”</p>
<p>And a missionary he remains – continuing to spread the word. “Everybody has to do their homework, I don’t care who it is. They come to me with all sorts of ailments and fears. I tell them you have to know everything you can about what you are putting in your body and you have to be comfortable with it but read everything you can. Do what I did, study it and study the plant itself. Study the whole thing and put your mind at ease. The last thing I want anybody to do is take my word for it because what works for me might not work for you.”</p>
<p>Chong enthusiastically continued, “That’s the kind of knowledge and encouragement people need because the healing process is about knowing that what you are doing is going to heal you. If you have faith in it, then you will be healed. I don’t care what disease you have, do your homework, make sure you know what you are putting in your body. You should know that with all the drugs they give you. Just read the label before you put it your body.”</p>
<p>Chong is not surprised that marijuana has and continues to have a positive impact on his life. “What pot really did for me was put an intelligent and positive spin on my life and it’s been doing that all my life. The other great thing is the spiritual aspect because, once, after I did my first toke of cannabis I went on a God search. </p>
<p>“I have always leaned in that direction. When I was kid I went to Sunday school and I ended up teaching it and I went to a bible camp when I was eight years old, and it changed my life. I learned how to pray and I learned the basic Christian teachings, the parables, and it stayed with me all my life, but when I got into cannabis I went more into the Eastern spiritual area. Cannabis is really responsible for me going on a God search. If you want to be happy for the rest of your life, look for God. That’s all it takes.”</p>
<p>That and making people laugh, Chong concluded.  “I think when you make people laugh, you are healing a lot of ailments that they don’t even know they have. I think that’s the greatest thing about cannabis is that it makes you laugh and the reason it makes you laugh is because you start focusing in on silly little things you didn’t notice before.</p>
<p>“And so I have come to the conclusion, I have always been right. Back in the ‘70s we did an interview and I asked what if we are right? What if Cheech and Chong are right and everybody else is wrong? And it’s proven to be.” </p>

		<title>TIPS FOR THE FIRST-TIMER</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a few things to know before you attend a cannabis-infused dinner. If you are new to consuming cannabis, start low and go slow. A typical edible dose ranges between 10 and 20 milligrams per serving. With edibles it typically takes 20 to 40 minutes to feel the effects. Knowing this information should help you educate and appropriately pace yourself. Below are some tips from the pros.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul style="padding: 0 50px 0 50px">
  <li><p>The biggest mistake you can make is not to go, advises Dope Dining’s Shannon Dorn. She also says to ask questions of your servers so you are educated about what you are eating and enjoy yourself.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding: 0 50px 0 50px">
  <li>
    <p>Chef Brandi Madison counsels not to be nervous or overwhelmed and to pace yourself. “I have had some people eat stuff and don’t feel anything and have had some people eat one cookie and they are so high. It’s going to be relative to your body and your constitution so go in with the best of intentions and expectations.” </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding: 0 50px 0 50px">
  <li>
    <p>Eat before you go as an empty stomach can make the effects of cannabis happen quicker and be more intense. </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding: 0 50px 0 50px">
  <li>
    <p>Should you overmedicate and need to counteract the psycho-activity of THC, CBD will help. “Take some CBD oil because that will bring you back down into your body and take you out of your head. Have some CBD handy and take a couple of drops so you have more of a body high and less of a head high,” advises chef Madison.
</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding: 0 50px 0 50px">
  <li>
    <p>Another tip if you have consumed too much is to drink lots of water. “That’s the best thing you can do. It’s usually anxiety that gets the best of people.All you have to do is drink some water and go to sleep and you will be fine,” says chef Madison.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul style="padding: 0 50px 0 50px">
  <li>
    <p>Finally, take a cab or Uber/Lyft afterward so you can enjoy as much as you want without having to drive impaired, advises Don Decatur. </p>
  </li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Field Report:</strong><span > Dab Another Day </span><span ><br /></span><strong>Agent: </strong><span >#00710 Bong, James</span><span ><br /></span><strong>Mission:</strong><span >Octokushy</span><span ><br /></span><strong>Status:</strong><span > 00710 APPROVED</span></p>

<p><span >I slowly opened my eyes and tried to piece together the events of the last couple of hours. Where was I? What happened? Did I lose my vape pen? In the distance, I made out the silhouette of a beautiful woman. I squinted and noticed a strange
 tattoo on her shoulder before she vanished into thin air. </span></p>

<p><span >Suddenly the phone rang. I snapped out of it and realized I was in a villa at the Bellagio.  
“Good morning, Octokushy. This is your wakeup call.”
Octokushy? I scratched my head...had I stumbled upon the mythical craps hustler-turned-ganjapreneur and let her slip through my fingers?
</span></p>

<p><em>James,</br>
XXX by Virtue is my strain and shooting dice is my game. This Jane West bong is elegant and smooth, take a few rips and get on the move. </br>
--Octokush
</em></p>

<p><span >The scent of something dank led me to the living room. Laying on the coffee table I found three things: some gorgeous nugs, a majestic blue vase, and a note.</span></p>

<p><span >The note was sealed with a kiss and the sketch of a rose. Where had I seen this rose before? 
No time to worry about that now as those sticky XXX nugs were calling my name. I examined the bong that I had mistaken for a vase. Its sleek and strong body reminded me of the Fabergé egg I had picked up at an auction earlier this week. Load, rip, clear, repeat. I was impressed with the smooth and flavorful hits and how easily the bowl cashed and chamber cleared. I could see why this was Octokushy’s piece of choice.  
</span></p>

<p><span >I poked around the suite to learn more about my mystery girl. A-ha! She thought she could pull a fast one on old 00710 but she made a rookie mistake and left her cosmetics case on the bathroom counter.  </span></p>

<p><span >I unzipped it and examined the inventory: lipstick…powder compact…cotton swabs...weed grinder...nothing out of the ordinary. Wait a minute, what's a weed grinder doing in a makeup case? On closer inspection, I realized that the lipstick was actually a limited edition Badwoods Micro G-Pen, the compact turned into a stashbox, and the swabs were infused with isopropyl alcohol for on-the-go tool cleaning. Everything was marked with her signature rose too…nice touch, Octokushy. I loaded the G-Pen with some Tangilope Shatter by MatrixNV and took a massive rip. Damn…I was in love. </span></p>

<p><span >My mind was bouncing like a circus. Had I met the Bong girl of my dreams? Determined to find her, I went back to the living room for an inspirational toke from the Jane West bong and to devise a plan. Nothing would stop me…except for maybe this room service menu. Does that say grilled cheese with tater tots stuffed inside the bread?</span></p>

<p><span >To be continued…</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Nij Kuruvilla, Founder & CEO, Break Green</h4>
<p>Cannabis-infused barbeque may not be what comes to mind when you hear&nbsp;<em>California green rush</em>, but the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.teachcannabiscooking.com/">Teach Cannabis Cooking</a>&nbsp;team in Oakland would have you think differently. The legalization of cannabis is allowing daring entrepreneurs to push the boundaries of California&rsquo;s new cash crop. Barbeque and cannabis entrepreneurs Dennis, Chris and Joseph brought together their love for all things smoked to a new concept they&rsquo;re launching &mdash; Teach Cannabis Cooking (TCC). This past weekend, a group of us were asked to participate in the debut of their first workshop,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.teachcannabiscooking.com/courses.html">CannaQue 101: BBQ and Cannabis</a>.<br />I arrived a little before the festivities to learn more about Dennis, Chris and Joseph&rsquo;s foray into cannabis cuisine. Walking into the outdoor-cooking area, I was immediately hit with the aromas of smoked meat with a hint of a more pungent&nbsp;<em>green</em>&nbsp;herb. I knew this wasn&rsquo;t going to be my dad&rsquo;s weekend grill-out.<br />California barbeque (aka&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Maria-style_barbecue">Santa Maria-style</a>) is known for beef tri-tip seasoned with black pepper, salt, and garlic salt before grilling over live-oak coals. The guys at TCC decided to add their own California-twist to the traditional barbecue style. Pushing the norms of grilling is a part of the Teach Cannabis Cooking team&rsquo;s core mission. They&rsquo;ve been fusing non-traditional ingredients into traditional-American barbeque for over a decade. From incorporating Korean-style barbeque to Indian tandoori-style, their exploration of meat, spices, herb, and flame was bound to infuse cannabis eventually.<br />Wearing a marijuana-leaf inspired shirt and tending to the flame of the grill, chef Joseph was easy to spot. Speaking to him, you knew he was passionate about food and bringing people together, which both barbeque and cannabis have a magical way of doing. Making sure to pass on any joint that was passed to him so that he was sober during the class, Joseph went on to explain his passion for cooking. He served as executive chef at Fleur de Lys, a French-inspired fine dining restaurant on San Juan Island. He&rsquo;s since sharpened his culinary craft through barbeque, fusing eclectic tastes and flame to each dish he prepares.<strong><br /></strong>Dennis is the founder and owner of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.liberationfoods.net/">Liberation Foods</a>, a barbeque catering company serving the Bay Area. He and Joseph both met because of their passion for grilling through a barbeque professional&rsquo;s network. In his own words, he co-created Teach Cannabis Cooking as &ldquo;a way to share barbeque and cannabis cooking with the world through a fun and relaxed environment.&rdquo;<strong><br /></strong>If Joseph and Dennis bring the fire, Chris contributes the green. A photographer whose company,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kandidkush.com/">Kandid Kush</a>, specializes in high-quality photography for the cannabis industry, Chris has an established network in an industry that&rsquo;s still in its infancy. The trio formed the Teach Cannabis Cooking group to bring their love of marijuana and Barbeque-cuisine &ldquo;to change the way you look at cannabis.&rdquo;<br />Teach Cannabis Cooking was created to share the wonders of infusing cannabis with delicious recipes from around the world. Courses range from the basics of infusion, theory and application to infusing cannabis with Indonesian food. The TCC team is passionate about their love of food and the extra comfort that infusing cannabis provides.<br />As the final guests settled in for the workshop, Chef Joseph got started with the class&hellip;<em>&ldquo;Barbeque is relaxing and comforting. Cannabis touches on the same primal triggers.&rdquo;</em><em><br /></em>Our group got a hands-on demonstration on how to safely decarb flower, extract cannabis oil, infuse with barbeque sauce, and properly marinate and cook brisket and ribs.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Decarb the flower</strong><br /><strong>Step 2: Add to cheesecloth with other herbs &amp; spices</strong><br /><strong>Step 3: Grab a friend and help tie into a pouch</strong><br /><strong>Step 4: Drop into pot for oil to absorb into barbeque sauce</strong><br /><strong>Step 5: Let it stew</strong><br /><strong>Step 6 to Step 9: Marinate ribs and smoke for 8+ hours (thankfully, our meal was pre-cooked)</strong><br /><strong>Final Step: Enjoy</strong></p>

<p>The opportunities to enter the cannabis space are endless and open for anyone who wants to jump in. This is the Wild West for the cannabis industry and it will take bold entrepreneurs to push the boundaries of what the public will accept as the next big thing. The Teach Cannabis Cooking team is clearly setting a&nbsp;<em>high</em>&nbsp;bar for future cannabis experiences. Here&rsquo;s hoping they have a long journey as they explore the next frontier of cannabis cuisine and push the limits of an entirely new American industry.<br /><br /><em>You can find Teach Cannabis Cooking and other cannabis experiences at&nbsp;</em><a href="http://letsbreakgreen.com/"><em>LetsBreakGreen.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Currently Utah has authorized a very limited medical marijuana program specifically for patients with severe epilepsy to access low-THC, high-cannabidiol cannabis oil extracts to manage the disorder. 

A new bill, expected to be unveiled this week, would legalize other forms of medical marijuana, allowing the use of certain marijuana products containing THC – including oils and edibles – for people suffering with specific conditions and only with a doctor's approval. The bill, proposed by Senator Mark Madsen (R-Saratoga Springs), would still not allow for marijuana to be smoked. 

It's not clear whether Madsen's bill, titled "Medical Cannabis Amendments," will receive the support of his colleagues, but many lawmakers – including Governor Gary Herbert – who supported last year's approval of the limited cannabidiol-only program have expressed an unwillingness to expand to a more inclusive medical marijuana law.

Jennifer May, a co-founder of Hope for Children with Epilepsy, a group that was instrumental last year in pushing forward the bill that allows for children (as well as adults) with epilepsy to receive cannabis-derived oil treatment, supports a destigmatization of medical cannabis, and calls for lawmakers to start disassociating it from the negative image of stoners getting high on pot.  

In an interview with Fox 13 May stated, “We need to move the discussion from ‘this is a drug we don’t talk about or ever use’ over to a product or substance that can be used for many different purposes and it needs to be used for the proper purpose

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The annual American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) meeting was held in California earlier this month, and medical marijuana was a hot topic of discussion.

Cannabis experts from North America and the U.K. presented a wide range of data that supports increasingly popular claims of the potential significance of cannabis and cannabis-derived compounds in therapeutic medical treatment, citing it not only as an effective tool for pain management but also in treating neurological disorders like epilepsy and possibly even anxiety disorders. Side effects, while measureable, are also short-lived and disappear after use is discontinued (at least in adults). 

But, they acknowledge, research is insufficient. While a partial reason for this, at least in the United States, is the continued classification of marijuana as a controlled Schedule 1 substance – in the same group as heroin, ecstasy, and LSD – with tightly regulated access for clinical research highly restricted and requiring multi-agency approval, another reason is, simply, money. 

Reports Chemistry World, the print and online magazine of the European chemical sciences organization the Royal Society of Chemistry, "The field is stalled because large clinical trials require the deep pockets of the pharmaceutical sector, but a major barrier is the lack of intellectual property around some of these compounds. ‘They are old drugs, they are hard to lock in patents, and that makes it difficult for someone to invest significantly into these kinds of research studies that might not have the long-term payback,’ explained Mark Ware, who runs the pain research unit at McGill University, Canada."

Is it true that we have to wait for Big Pharma to catch up to the "green rush" before clinical research can really be done in earnest and to the degree needed to firmly substantiate the correlations between cannabinoid compounds and effective treatments for everything from chemotherapy-induced pain and nausea to PTSD that pioneer studies have strongly suggested? 

The situation might be even more complicated than Ware implies: there is evidence suggesting that Big Pharma is in fact actively lobbying against medical marijuana (once again: money), but with 23 states as well as the District of Columbia and Guam now allowing for some degree of public medical marijuana and/or cannabis programs and a voting public increasingly eager to get on with it already, medical marijuana is increasingly something not to be buried or ignored.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Apple's notoriously arbitrary, and arbitrarily enforced, App Store policy – which has blocked, among other things, gun imagery and cannabusiness apps – has lightened up a bit, at least as far as legally-operating marijuana apps are concerned.

After MassRoots, an Instagram-styled pot-centric social media network, was kicked out of the App Store last November (ironically on Election Day, as some states prepared to vote on marijuana legislation), the company wrote a letter to Apple and started an online petition that circulated like so much wildfire. 

This month Apple relented their draconian pot policy, lifting the ban on cannabis apps but with the caveat that mobile marijuana apps would be monitored and restricted based on geofencing – basically, to make sure that the marijuana app is being used in a state in which the marijuana-based services offered by the app are legal according to state law. So, it's still kind of a cluster, but it's a start, and certainly a win for MassRoots. 

The blocking of yet another social networking platform may seem insignificant, but with a budding "green rush" upon us and venture capitalists trying desperately to rid themselves of excess money on cannabusinesses that are the closest thing to a sure thing to rake in even more, Apple's mostly self-imposed pot prohibition (iOS is significantly more chill, if you will) is indeed stifling the growth of the auxiliary weed industry – but, much like the plant itself, that industry is nothing if not resilient. 

Zachary Marburger knows first-hand the pains of being a progressive cannabis company in a country still getting over its own internalized pot prejudices. CannaBuild already had two pot programs blocked – one that calculated the THC content in certain edibles, and another called Nuggle, a sort of Tinder for smokers. Mostly recently the company had their latest app, an "OpenTable for pot pickups" called Whaxy, approved by Apple. Marburger, serving as CEO of Whaxy, said to AdWeek, "The ability for us to even be in the App Store, let alone have the features we want and need for our businesses to be successful, is huge."

		<title>Texas: family becomes medical refugees to fine treatment for daughter&#039;s grand mal seizures</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yet another family that cannot wait for lawmakers to catch up with medical treatment is relocating to another state to seek the medical treatment they need. 

Alexis Bortell is nine years old and suffers from grand mal epileptic seizures. In an <a href="http://www.kvue.com/story/news/state/2015/02/20/girl-needing-medical-cannabis-leaving-texas-immediately/23775179/" title="Girl needing medical cannabis leaving Texas immediately" target="_blank">interview with KVUE Austin</a>, Alexis's father Dean Bartell said, "February 4, she had the worst seizure of her life. Paramedics had to come. She stopped breathing." 

That seizure brought on stroke-like symptoms, the severity of which has sent the family packing up their Austin home to relocate to a suburb of Denver, Colorado, where Alexis will begin receiving low-THC, cannabis-derived cannabidiol oil treatment for her seizures – a treatment that will not have the intoxicating effect commonly associated with cannabis, but one that will help to control her seizures and related symptoms. 

The Bartells had planned on staying in Texas through the legislative session in May, but this latest epileptic episode has them moving immediately. 

Texas State Representative Stephanie Klick (R-Fort Worth) and State Senator Kevin Eltife (R-Tyler) have introduced joint medical marijuana bills, called the "<a href="http://www.thedailychronic.net/2015/40131/limited-cbd-only-medical-marijuana-legalization-bills-filed-in-texas/" title="Texas Compassionate Use Act" target="_blank">Texas Compassionate Use Act</a>," to Texas lawmakers. But they face a tough road ahead selling it to their colleagues, especially since Governor Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Patrick both oppose medical marijuana, despite the fact that the bills proposed <a href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/two-texas-republicans-have-a-crappy-plan-to-sorta-not-really-legalize-medical-marijuana-7126728" title="Plan to Sorta, Not Really Legalize Medical Marijuana" target="_blank">call for non-intoxicating cannabis derivatives much like what Alexis will receive in Colorado</a> – making it, in effect, akin to any other prescription pharmaceutical, but with a greater established efficacy for specific kinds of pain and symptom management than anything else on the market. 

Regardless of the future of those two cannabidiol-only medicinal marijuana bills, Dean Bartell said in a statement that, even if passed, they could be forced to wait as long as 2018 for the first medical dispensary to be licensed, and they simply do not have that long given the severity of Alexis's condition and the likelihood of immediate relief that the cannabis oil offers. Additionally, the proposed bills are still so restrictive in nature – requiring that there be absolutely no treatment alternatives available (meaning that they would possibly be forced to consider brain surgery before cannabis) and capping the THC percentage at a dose so low it was recommended by Alexis's Colorado doctors as merely a starting point – that even holding out hope for these bills to pass could still ultimately lead to disappointment and a necessary move across state lines.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Meet the coolest grandma in America – 91-year-old Aurora Leveroni, also known as “Nonna Marijuana.”

Nonna is a master of marijuana cooking and a fierce advocate medicinal marijuana use. When her daughter Valerie Leveroni Corral was in a car accident over 40 years ago, the brain trauma Valerie sustained from the accident caused her to have severe grand mal seizures – up to five a day – for which she had a pharmacopeia of prescription drugs that didn't help. She eventually discovered that marijuana provided her the relief that nothing else could. 

And that's when Nonna started cooking with cannabis to help her daughter. 

In this first episode of Bong Appetite from Vice's Munchies, host Matt Zimbric visits Nonna and Valerie at their home and medicinal marijuana farm in northern California. 

Valerie formed the Wo/Men's Alliance for Medical Marijuana (WAMM) in 1993 with then-husband Michael, the first medical marijuana collective to receive nonprofit status from the federal government and a highly influential, high-profile medical marijuana advocacy organization. Valerie herself has been likened to Mother Teresa. Members of WAMM receive medicinal marijuana in exchange for volunteer work on the farm, and members who are too sick to work are not charged at all.

In the video, Zimbric tours the farm with Valerie, who gives a brief lesson on different strains of the cannabis plants they grow and their general medicinal uses and effects. We hear testimonials from Valerie and another friend, whose asthma suffering has been significantly reduced through marijuana use. 

And we get to see Nonna being the boss that she is in the kitchen. 

"I like to cook with medical marijuana because I feel that it helps those who have been ill and have had to endure pain," Nonna says on camera. "I will use it if it helps anyone."

While she is an extremely passionate proponent of medicinal marijuana, she doesn’t ingest it herself and doesn't even sample her own cannabis cooking. "I don't get high on my own supply!" she happily exclaims. 

This is 20 minutes of your time extremely well spent!

		<title>Colorado: Overall tax revenue up due to marijuana sales</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It looks like Colorado got more than it bargained for with the legalization of recreational marijuana use. 

No, crime rates haven't skyrocketed and the children haven't dropped out of school en masse as sensationalist propaganda would have you believe. On the contrary, it looks like the biggest problem the State of Colorado is facing after legalizing recreational marijuana use is that it is making too much money.

Simply put, the state constitution limits how much tax money the state can take in before it has to start giving some of it back. Meaning that, with overall tax revenue up as the result of an improving economy and other tax collections growing faster, in conjunction with the surplus of tax revenue generated by the addition of taxed marijuana sales, Coloradans might be seeing their own share of the estimated $50 million that was raised in marijuana taxes in 2014, the first year in which marijuana was legal. 

That could mean as much as $30.5 million in marijuana tax refunds, translating to about $7.63 per adult in Colorado. While the per-person refund is negligible, it is creating quite a headache for lawmakers who now have to decide if and how to dole out these refunds and to whom. (For example, should the refunds be issued to all taxpayers, or just those who purchased marijuana?) 

Ironically, this is not necessarily welcome news to Colorado residents, who specifically voted for legislation that would legalize marijuana with the understanding that taxes earned from marijuana sales would go to the state and schools. 

State officials are scrambling to find a way to circumvent refunding tax dollars earned from marijuana sales, which could possibly include a third marijuana-related ballot that would this time ask voters to exempt marijuana taxes from the refund requirement.   

According to the Associated Press, "Lawmakers seem confident that the refund mechanism won't matter because voters would approve pot taxes a third time if asked." 

The same AP article quotes Republican Senate President Bill Cadman as saying, "I think it's appropriate that we keep the money for marijuana that the voters said that we should," noting that his party opposes keeping other refunds based on the Taxpayers' Bill of Rights but favors a special ballot question on pot taxes.

Still, a state having to manage a surplus of tax revenue is not such a bad problem to have, nor is having both Republicans and Democrats agreeing on a tax issue for once.

		<title>Academy of Pediatrics requesting a reclassification</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The American Academy of Pediatrics is requesting that the Drug Enforcement Administration reclassify marijuana as a less harmful substance in order to facilitate research of the substance for medical use. 

Marijuana is currently on the DEA’s Schedule 1 listing for controlled substances, which are not considered to have any “currently accepted medical use in the U.S., a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and a high potential for abuse.” Other drugs in this category include heroin, LSD, and ecstasy.

The AAP wants marijuana downgraded to the list of Schedule 2 drugs, which are considered to have a “high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence.” These include various widely prescription narcotics, such as oxycodone, morphine, and codeine, which are used for medical purposes despite being high risk for addiction and abuse. While the accuracy of a Schedule 2 designation for marijuana is still dubious – is it really accurate to claim that marijuana has a high potential for abuse and dependence, and is there even substantial data to support that? – it would at the very least allow for pediatric research, especially relevant in the conversation regarding medicinal marijuana, as pediatric uses and effects potentially differ from those of adults. 

Cannabis has been suggested as an alternative treatment for symptoms associated with developmental and behavioral pediatric conditions such as autism, ADHD, epilepsy, and Tourette's syndrome, though there is also a more pronounced concern over the potential effects of cannabis on the developing child and adolescent brain. The research data as it currently stands is insufficient and speculative at best. 

“By placing [marijuana] on Schedule 2, it would allow the FDA to be involved [in pediatric research] as the agency is in any study," says Seth Ammerman, a clinical professor in pediatrics at Stanford University and a member of the AAP national committee on substance abuse, who co-authored the new policy statement. "Unless scheduling changes, this won’t happen. And there could be therapeutic benefits. The AAP is not opposed to medical marijuana, per se, but we feel it’s important that this be explored within the [framework of the] FDA process, where you have standardization.”

As the Wall Street Journal points out, the AAP recommendation is significant. "By adopting such a policy, the influential medical society is lending its voice to a growing national debate over the veracity of using marijuana for medical purposes. And any steps that lead toward new research may also open the door to further investment from a variety of companies that view marijuana as a growing, if risky market."

Ammerman contends that most people realize AAP advocacy is for the well-being of children, and that the medical society will advocate for medicinal marijuana research if there is a chance that the results of such research could help improve pediatric care.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As medical marijuana becomes more widely accepted as an alternative for chronic pain management – treating everything from the nausea experienced with chemotherapy treatment to Crohn's disease, seizure disorders, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, and nerve pain – researchers are studying cannabis compounds for other kinds of potentially beneficial medical treatments. 

A study recently published by the <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/" title="Journal of Neuroscience" target="_blank">Journal of Neuroscience</a>, conducted by neuroscientists from the University of Buffalo's Research Institute on Addictions, suggests that endocannabinoids – chemical compounds naturally synthesized by the animal and human brain that work on the same receptors as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active component of Cannabis sativa – may be <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/stress-management/expert-answers/stress/faq-20058233" title="treating depression that results from chronic stress" target="_blank">helpful in treating depression that results from chronic stress</a>. 

Researchers found that in studies on lab rats, chronic stress reduced the natural production of endocannabinoids, which are crucial to bioregulation and affect our metabolic system and insulin sensitivity, as well as cognition, emotion, and behavior. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4273654/" target="_blank">Recent research of the endocannabinoid system</a> suggests that modulation of this regulatory system may be a cure for more chronic neurologic and immune conditions. 

Chronic stress is a major risk factor in the development of depression, and this new research on the endocannabinoid system suggests that reduction of endocannabinoid production in the brain may play a role in this neuropsychological link. 

The research team found that administering marijuana-derived cannabinoids to the rats to be an effective way to restore endocannabinoid levels in their brains, suggesting that marijuana-derived cannabinoids may in fact be a viable therapeutic treatment for stress-related depression symptoms. 

"Chronic stress is one of the major causes of depression," Haj-Dahmane stated in a <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/news/releases/2015/02/004.html" title="Using compounds derived from cannabis - marijuana - to restore normal endocannabinoid function " target="_blank">press release from the University of Buffalo</a>. "Using compounds derived from cannabis — marijuana — to restore normal endocannabinoid function could potentially help stabilize moods and ease depression."

While Haj-Dahmane is careful to also note that the research is preliminary and so far has only been conducted in clinical trials on rats, the possibility of finding similar results in human trials is strong. As <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/pot-news/medical-marijuana-growing-choice-ptsd-victims" title="Releaving PTSD" target="_blank">medical marijuana has already been reported to alleviate symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder</a> in sufferers, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/22/cannabis-ptsd_n_6199254.html" title="Treatment for PTSD" target="_blank">research on the effects of synthetic cannabinoids on the brain's trauma centers</a> has supported these claims, the results of Haj-Dahmane's research are promising.

		<title>District of Columbia: Pot is legal</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here's what sets the city apart from states that have legalized:


<h4>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?</h4>

Nearly two-thirds of District voters approved a November ballot initiative legalizing pot for recreational purposes. Congress tried to block it by inserting language in a subsequent spending bill, but District leaders said the initiative had already become law and couldn't be undone by Congress pulling funding. The initiative took effect Thursday.

<h4>WHAT'S LEGAL AND WHAT'S NOT?</h4>

People 21 and older can possess and use up to 2 ounces of pot or grow up to three mature plants in private homes. People can also give as much as 1 ounce away to another person.

<h4>WHAT'S PRIVATE, WHAT'S PUBLIC?</h4>

The city sums it up in four words: "home grow, home use." Smoking in public or in cars, restaurants, bars and coffee shops remains illegal, and the city is moving to ban it in private clubs. Possession also is illegal in public housing, but Police Chief Cathy Lanier said local police won't make arrests there for possession. Federal officers can make such arrests, however.

<h4>WILL POT BE AVAILABLE FOR SALE?</h4>

No. Congress explicitly banned the District from establishing laws allowing for marijuana to be sold, taxed or regulated, as Colorado and Washington state have done.

<h4>WASN'T POT ALREADY LEGAL?</h4>

The District has allowed medical marijuana and decriminalized possession of small amounts of pot last year, replacing arrests with $25 civil fines. Now the fines are gone, too.

<h4>WHAT'S THE ROLE OF CONGRESS?</h4>

The District has had "home rule" power to make its own laws for 40 years, but Congress still has the final word. Federal lawmakers commonly forbid policies they oppose by attaching language to crucial legislation, like the federal spending bill President Barack Obama signed in December.

<h4>ARE CITY LEADERS IN TROUBLE NOW?</h4>

House Judiciary Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, warned Mayor Muriel Bowser that she and other city officials could face prison under a law banning federal agencies from spending unappropriated money. But Congress can't prosecute anyone, and the Justice Department is highly unlikely to do so. Congress can still sue, or pull funding for other city programs.

<h4>CAN YOU SMOKE A JOINT ON THE NATIONAL MALL?</h4>

No. Even possessing pot on federal property remains illegal, just as it is in Colorado and Washington state, which have huge swaths of U.S. land. Complicating matters, the District has 59 inner-city squares and triangles in federal jurisdiction. Since decriminalization took effect last year, 30 people have been arrested for possession on federal property, Lanier said.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week TechCrunch writer Kim-Mai Cutler recounted his experience using the brand-new medical marijuana home physician service CannabisMD, currently available in San Francisco, Berkley, and Oakland. 

CannabisMD dispatches a licensed physician right to your front door for medical marijuana evaluations, while Meadow – CannabisMD's parent startup co-founded by David Hua, Rick Harrison, Harrison Lee, and Scott Garman – is a mobile app-based medical marijuana delivery service that functions similarly to the uber-convenient on-demand car service that everyone loves to hate (and loves to use), Uber. 

Co-founder David Hua is an entrepreneur extraordinaire, graduate of Oakland's Oaksterdam University (which educates students on all aspects of the cannabis industry), and self-described "plus one" to his wife's popular food blog Lick My Spoon – he's even got her on the cannabis bandwagon promoting gourmet marijuana edibles. He describes Meadow as "GrubHub for cannabis." The startup has recently received funding from Y Combinator, which has funded over 800 startups since 2005 including Scribd, Reddit, Airbnb, Dropbox, Disqus, and Stripe. 

CannabisMD acts as a booking agent connecting licensed physicians to patients. Right now the appointments are scheduled, but will later be offered on-demand. A consultation takes 15-45 minutes and costs $100 for new patients, $50 for renewals. During the consultation the physician will ask the patient why he or she would like to use medical marijuana and will then determine if he or she is a candidate for a medical marijuana card. 

With Meadow, patients can peruse dispensaries' menus and the dispensaries themselves handle the delivery, which Meadow then gets a percentage of. The company takes great pains to ensure compliance with local marijuana regulations and doesn't actually sell marijuana – it sells software – with plans of full integration with dispensaries' inventories in the future. 

As the social stigma around marijuana decreases in tandem with a rapid shift in regulatory legislation across the country, a "green rush" is starting to happen – one in which progressive investors with a keen eye on this burgeoning cash crop stand to make obscene amounts of money. To recap, the State of Colorado is making more money in marijuana-related tax revenue than they know what to do with, Colorado and Washington are expecting $800 million in tax revenue this year), and the medical marijuana industry pulled in $2.7 billion in 2014, up from $1.5 billion the previous year. It seems only natural then that venture capitalists are all too eager to invest in the budding marijuana industry. (Pun intended.)

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With all of the many, many strains of cannabis in the world, all with their own unique THC and CBD content and physiological effects, it helps to have something to act as a guide.

And that's exactly what the Cannabis Pocket Reference is for.

The Android app – not yet available on Apple, presumably because of their strict policy on all pot-related apps – acts as an exhaustive database of 225 different types of cannabis, and also contains information about the history of cannabis, the laws governing cannabis in each county (including where it is legal to buy and smoke it), an exclusive grow guide, information on alternate forms of ingestion, and the latest in marijuana-related news.

Information on each strain includes THC and CBD content, time to flowering, diseases the plant can have, and graphics outlining various features. 

The Cannabis Pocket Reference is designed as THE ultimate cannabis companion, ideal for everyone from the recreational smoker interested in learning more about different strains to the professional grower looking for more sophisticated horticultural information, from those in the patient care industry to would-be cannabis culinarians. It is easily the most extensively informative cannabis app available, and downloads all information directly to your Android phone or tablet so it can also be used offline. Costing just $2.89, it is an extremely valuable resource for anyone with a semi-serious interest in marijuana beyond the occasional recreational toke.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[New U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, in his first television appearance that aired on CBS This Morning, was asked in the interview about his stance on the legalization of marijuana. His reply was a diplomatic if non-committal, "We have some preliminary data that for certain medical conditions and symptoms, that marijuana can be helpful."

In a follow-up to that interview, the Department of Health and Human Services issued a statement attributed to Murthy that re-emphasized his position that marijuana policy should be "driven by science" and "subjected to the same, rigorous clinical trials and scientific scrutiny that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) applies to all new medications."

As it seemed as though the CBS This Morning anchors were intentionally putting him on the spot regarding the marijuana legalization debate, it is no surprise that he was unwilling to take an outspoken, definitive stance in favor of legalization. However, implicit in his response is support for further research and open-mindedness to what the results of that research could mean for future policy changes. Hesitant though his support of marijuana as a potential medical treatment may have been, it was also decidedly not opposition, and with this small statement on national news came another large step towards the institutional validation of medicinal marijuana. 

Murthy's televised statement was met with little backlash, underscoring a dramatic shift in social opinion regarding marijuana in general and medicinal marijuana in particular that has happened over the last two decades, with the majority of Americans now in support of marijuana legalization. By comparison, when U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders made a statement supporting the consideration of drug legalization as an idea at least worth considering in 1993, the same year Bill Clinton raised the federal "drug czar" position to cabinet-level status, she was immediately mired in controversy and forced to resign the next year. (In 2010, however, she outright advocated for marijuana legalization.) 

"Dr. Murthy's comments add to a growing consensus in the medical community that marijuana can help people suffering from painful conditions," Tom Angell, chairman of drug policy reform group Marijuana Majority, told The Huffington Post. "It's crazy that federal law still considers marijuana a Schedule I drug, a category that's supposed to be reserved for substances with no medical value. In light of these comments from his top medical adviser, the president should direct the attorney general to immediately begin the process of rescheduling marijuana."

		<title>Nebraska: lawmakers consider state&#039;s first medical marijuana bill</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nebraska lawmakers are about to consider the state's first medicinal marijuana bill. 

While opponents argue that scientific data is lacking, those in the scientific and medical communities – including the U.S. Attorney General – argue in turn that the use of marijuana for medical treatment shows legitimate promise that needs further research. Meaning, that while opponents are technically "correct" in their assertion that data is lacking, it is not the fault in the data itself but in the decades of stigmatization around marijuana that impeded legitimate medical research, which is still in its relative infancy.

Legislative Bill 643, called the Cannabis Compassion and Care Act, is scheduled for a March 6 hearing before the Judiciary Committee. 

The Kearney Hub, a Nebraska-based newspaper, points out that the bill has a long, hard road to fight and the path isn't going to be an easy one: among the bill's opponents are the Nebraska Medical Association, Governor Pete Ricketts, and Attorney General Doug Peterson. The state has also partnered with Oklahoma to sue Colorado to overturn their legalization of recreational marijuana use. 

But, says the Hub, despite claims of there being a lack of sufficient evidence to support the clams of marijuana's therapeutic uses, there are still those who cite a favorable outlook on its potential based on testimonies and clinical studies and advocate for further research. 

For those who fret over the potentials of abuse in medical marijuana use, there are indeed non-inebriating substances found in marijuana that are shown to be just as effective in medical treatment. Cannabidiol, an active cannabinoid compound found in marijuana, has a wider scope of medical applications than the more popularly known tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and does not produce the same intoxicating effects. Rosalie Liccardo Pacula, who co-directs drug policy research for the RAND Corp., is quoted in the Hub saying, “It’s the Tylenol version of marijuana, and for some conditions, that’s all you need.”

Even still, cannabidiol-based pharmacology is years away from getting an FDA-approved prescription to the market, and those suffering from debilitating neuropathic pain and other ailments effectively treated by marijuana don't want to wait the decade or more that it can take for a drug treatment to go through clinical trials. Medicinal marijuana still poses the easiest and most immediate solution. 

In the case of Ashley Taillard, an Air Force veteran with severe nerve damage from an injury she sustained during her service, she had internalized the stigmatization of marijuana so much she had to set aside her long-held beliefs that drugs of all kinds are bad and wrong to consider marijuana as an alternative treatment for her constant pain she is otherwise unable to control through a bevy of prescriptions and epidurals. A desperate trip to Colorado ended with the mother of four in tears of relief. But because she and her husband don't want to break the law, they did not bring any marijuana back from Colorado with them, and are instead relying on Nebraska lawmakers to take the proactive lead. For her sake, let's hope they do.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While marijuana is typically maligned in popular thought as the "gateway drug," some believe medical marijuana might actually be helpful in treating drug addiction. 

In an interview with Southern Colorado's KOAA TV, Jaymen Johnson, owner of medical marijuana healthcare facility OMM Alternative, believes that marijuana could be used as an alternative treatment for drug addiction. 

There isn't yet any substantial research from the medical community to support his claim, but it does at least seem to have some potential credibility. By comparison, methadone is the drug treatment of choice for addiction to opioids like morphine and heroin. The problem is, methadone also creates dependency, if not addiction. According to the Center for Disease Control, in 2009 methadone accounted for more than 30 percent of all deaths associated with prescription opioids – an increase of six times the number of deaths over a 10-year period – and further estimates about 5,000 people die each year of overdoses related to methadone. Additionally, states that have passed medical marijuana laws have 25% fewer painkiller overdose deaths than states that have not. 

[gallery ids="118,121,115,107,98,112"]

The correlation between medical marijuana use and reduced prescription overdose deaths is at best tenuous right now, as there are only a limited number of years of data to evaluate and research into the long-term effects of medical marijuana is still in its infancy, but it certainly bears more exploration. With medical cannabis patients already substituting cannabis as an alternative to alcohol, prescription drugs, and illicit drugs for reasons of perceived safety, level of addiction potential, effectiveness in relieving symptoms, access, and level of acceptance, this could bode well for a potential alternative treatment for those with (typically severe) opioid addictions instead of the problematic methadone.]]></content:encoded>

With rapidly-changing policies regulating the use of medical marijuana and more and more states opting to legalize the use of marijuana for medical purposes, while a smaller number opt to decriminalize marijuana use and a smaller number still voting to legalize recreational marijuana use, it will only be a matter of time before the rest of the states fall in line and outright legalize the use of marijuana – especially since the majority of Americans are now in support of marijuana legalization. 

Colorado and Washington legalized recreational marijuana use in 2012, with Alaska, Oregon, and Washington D.C. passing legalization legislation in November 2014. But all of this policy reform has happened at the ballot; state legislatures have historically not been the vanguard of marijuana policy reform.

[caption id="attachment_132" align="alignleft" width="1024"]<img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Rhode-Island.jpg" alt="Rhode Island" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-499" /> Rhode Island’s actions could end up being the sea change in the marijuana policy reform legislation.[/caption]

<h1>Which state legislature will be the first to end the so-called "Pot Prohibition"?</h1>

It looks like it will be Rhode Island. Rhode Island is poised to become the first state in U.S. history to pass an adult use legalization bill through its state legislature, a historic shift in policy reform from voter-led legalization to the legislative process. The Marijuana Policy Project and regional grassroots campaign Regulate Rhode Island have had great success at the State House and will likely clinch the deal this year, in the wake of voter-led legalization campaigns in other states and D.C. as well as the not-insignificant promise of upwards of $82 million in tax revenue for the cash-strapped state that also happens to have the highest reported percentage of marijuana users. (For reference, Washington and Colorado are expected to see at least $800 million in extra revenue over the next few years thanks to marijuana sales, and Colorado quite literally is making so much money from recreational marijuana taxes it is going to have to start giving some back.)

If Rhode Island does succeed in breaking the taboo around adult use legalization at the legislative level, it could mean a watershed moment in the widespread legalization of marijuana throughout America. While the handful of above-mentioned states have been able to pass marijuana policy reform legislation through state ballot initiatives, roughly half of the states have no ballot initiative process at all, and of those that do the legislature still has a role in shaping policy. Simply put, while outliers like Colorado and Washington might have found success in legalization efforts, without the active support of the state legislature it will likely still be a long time before other states follow suit. 

Thus, the State of Rhode Island's actions could end up being the sea change in the marijuana policy reform legislation coming from voter-elected officials rather than the voters themselves. ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the first time ever, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/03/04/majority-of-americans-favor-marijuana-legalization-for-first-time-according-to-the-nations-most-authoritative-survey/">General Social Survey (GSS) shows that the majority of Americans favor the legalization of marijuana</a>.

The GSS is a national public survey that is conducted every two years and is a respected source of public opinion research. In-person interviews were conducted between March and October of last year in which 1,687 respondents were asked, "Do you think the use of marijuana should be made legal or not?"

52 percent were in favor, 42 percent opposed, and seven percent were undecided. Support was up nine percentage points from the last time the survey was conducted in 2012.

The GSS has tracked public opinion on marijuana for 40 years now, showing that support rose during the 1970s only to plummet again during the Reagan administration and the dawn of the "War on Drugs." It has been climbing steadily again since the 1990s, with a significant spike in support occurring over the last decade.

The findings of this most recent GSS are in keeping with other public opinion polls, such as <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/179195/majority-continues-support-pot-legalization.aspx">the most recent Gallup poll</a>, which also shows a majority of Americans – 51 percent – in support of legalization. This poll was conducted October 12-15 of last year, surveying 1,017 adults over the age of 18 by telephone.

<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/majority-of-americans-support-marijuana-legalization-for-first-time--survey-shows-211700847.html">In a statement reported by Yahoo News</a>, Morgan Fox, communications manager for the Marijuana Policy Project, said Americans are tired of laws that punish adults for enjoying a substance that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/02/23/marijuana-may-be-even-safer-than-previously-thought-researchers-say/">has been shown to be safer than alcohol</a>.

"Hopefully their elected officials are paying attention and preparing for the inevitable," Fox said. "The failures of marijuana prohibition are too obvious to ignore forever, which is evidenced by the growing support for ending it."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Medical marijuana dispensary <a href="http://www.idahostatesman.com/2015/02/28/3670110_permit-for-medical-marijuana-shop.html?rh=1">Nevada Organix has been approved</a> for a special use permit by Carson City planning commissioners despite opposition.

The opposition, it should be noted, came from <a href="http://www.recordcourier.com/news/15209424-113/carson-city-planning-commission-approves-medical-pot-shop">Carson City resident Jeff Fuhrman</a>, who owns a landscaping supply firm named Nevada Organics – certainly valid grounds for opposing the similarly-named dispensary, but also certainly not an issue of anti-marijuana moral campaigning.

Nevada Organix will be located at 135 Clearview Drive. CEO Bill Myer also operates Arizona Organix in Phoenix, and estimates serving about 40-50 patients per day at the Carson City location to start. There is no estimated opening date for the dispensary yet.

By state law, Carson City can have two dispensaries; this is the first one approved for operation.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Leslie Bosckor, co-founder of <a href="https://www.thecannabisindustry.org">Nevada Cannabis Industry Association</a>, is creating a similar association in his native New York, <a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20150304/HEALTH_CARE/150309936/leslie-bosckor-searches-for-gold-in-ny-pot">reports <em>Crain's New York Business.</em></a>

Through the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association, the investment banker turned canna-businessman, who has spent the last four years living in Nevada, has helped 15 organizations successfully apply for marijuana distribution licenses. He is launching a hedge fund based in Nevada that will invest throughout the country, and is also creating a cannabis industry association in New York.

The interview is worth quoting at length for Bosckor's unique insight into the future of the marijuana market locally, nationally, and globally, but here are some highlights. Be sure to <a href="http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20150304/HEALTH_CARE/150309936/leslie-bosckor-searches-for-gold-in-ny-pot">read the rest in <em>Crain's New York Business</em></a>.

<strong>On the potential market for legal marijuana: </strong>"The global recreational market is somewhere between $40 billion and $110 billion a year. The medical market is $10 billion a year, probably more. Then there's the supplement and nutraceutical market. If you go into Amazon right now and type in 'CBD,' there are over 100 products that come up with some reference to cannabidiol; there will be many, many more."

<strong>On what Nevada got right with their medical marijuana legislation</strong>: "There are a few things that Nevada has done right. One is [allowing] for-profit entities…The other common-sense component is reciprocity for other states' [medical marijuana] programs," referring to the fact that Nevada's dispensaries will accept valid medical marijuana cards from other states.

<strong>On Tribal marijuana interests</strong>: "Because Nevada is being looked at by many people as the best business-friendly and entrepreneur-friendly framework for the legal cannabis business, we are also stakeholders in other states. We've been approached by two Native American groups interested in doing business with us. You can do things when you utilize a sovereignty of a tribally formed enterprise that you can't do in any other way," going on to outline the potentiality of financial institution acquisition under Tribal sovereignty as well as importation of cannabis seeds from abroad otherwise illegal to import to the United States.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>MILITARY VETERAN USES CBD  TO TAKE HIS LIFE BACK FROM PTSD AND PHANTOM PAIN</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is going to be one of those stories where the customer liked the product so much he bought the business. Joff Paradise, a former member of the Airborne Special Forces for 27 years, was so satisfied with the results cannabidiol or CBD had in helping treat his PTSD and chronic pain, he decided to start an online business that would allow him to make it available to others who were suffering. </p>
<p>“We are in this to help people, I want to give back,” said Paradise of myhempcare.com, where he sells CBD-based products that comes in the form of sprays, capsules and concentrates and is legal in all 50 states. “I tell patients and clients all the time, I might not add years to your life, but I can definitely add life to your years.” </p>
<p>After discovering CBD in 2014, Paradise put life in his own years by slowly weaning himself off of 21 pharmaceuticals he used to treat chronic pain and PTSD he suffered as a result of a military career that included being shot four times, stabbed twice, and blown up once. Those injuries resulted in a textbook amputation of the military veteran’s left leg, a complete right knee replacement, plates in his head and knee, and a total of 34 surgeries and procedures just on his neck and spine alone. </p>
<p>At the suggestion of a fellow military veteran who had been exposed to Agent Orange and was a proponent of medical cannabis, Paradise initially started using CBD for “intense pain in my stump, but I have pain all over. I was suffering from all this chronic pain. But my biggest pain area and the place where I saw it work the quickest was on my phantom pain.</p>
<p>“Used to be, I always felt like something was standing on my foot, crushing it or I would have a burning sensation in the balls of my feet that wouldn’t stop,” Paradise explained of his phantom pain sensations, which are perceptions related to a limb that is not physically part of the body. “After using CBD, that pain wasn’t there anymore. Now it just feels normal and that’s a big deal because phantom pain makes some people go crazy. Since I have been using CBD, it’s gone and that just blows my mind because no doctor can do anything for phantom pain. There is no remedy or drug that they can prescribe to you for phantom pain.”</p>
<p>Paradise, who is 53, uses 100 milligrams of CBD spray from myhempcare.com each day, two squirts in the morning and two squirts in the evening. “After it saturates the cells of the body and the receptors and the nerves, it just works and it continues to work,” he relayed. </p>
<p>“When I first had my brain injury I couldn’t find my way around the block, I couldn’t complete a sentence and I would lose focus about what I was talking about,” Paradise recalled. “Now today, since I have cleared up all the prescription medications and use CBD, I can get anywhere we need to go, I am not getting lost anymore, I am keeping my focus and I don’t stutter  since I have been able to drop pharmaceuticals.” </p>
<p>Not only can Paradise focus now, but he is also currently on track to get his Ph.D. in anti-aging medicine and nanotechnology in 2018 and finds himself in a much different mental state. </p>
<p>“I am functioning now but before I didn’t want to go out into society, I was mad all the time. I wasn’t a happy person. Now I am easy to deal with. Instead of fighting at being an amputee, I accepted it. Now I am walking, I am going to conventions and I am giving seminars about homeopathic ways and being a naturalist,” Paradise explained. “It’s just a life-changing event to not be living in a fog. It changed my whole attitude, it changed my way of thinking.” </p>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[FFS, you've got to be kidding me. Joff Paradise (aka Jeffery Webb) is a pathological liar and con-man. This is the most preposterous bunch of bullshit I've ever read. He lost his leg in a motorcycle accident in 2011. His fabrication of military heroism shows what a pathetic, lying shit-weasel he is, and is an insult to those who have actually served this country with honor. Oh, and his ridiculous academic claims, ROTFLMFAO. Only someone with a complete lack of actual education would think that these sound even remotely legitimate or credible. Check them out. It took me all of about a minute to uncover a glaringly obvious amount of bullshit. This asshole can't even keep track of his own lies. He's nothing but a fraud and a grifter, trying to hawk any one of his mlm pyramid scheme's snake oil crap. The guy's a lying, scamming sociopath. Absolute garbage.

Seriously, it didn't occur to you to do a few seconds worth of research to find out that this person is a complete fraud? Congratulations, you gave a scammer free publicity to help him scam even more people. You should be embarrassed. SMH.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the goal of eliminating the subjectivity present in many cannabis competitions, Growers Network is holding a new cannabis competition for Colorado growers. All competitors who compete in the Grow-Off will receive the same unknown strain of cannabis and can compete in three categories: potency, flavor, and yield.</p>
<p>The Grow-Off will identify winners based on measurable results. Every competitor will be given a clone of the same unknown strain of cannabis to raise via whatever methods they believe are best. The cannabis will then be collected and submitted for laboratory testing in the categories of potency (THC/CBD content), flavor (concentration and variety of terpenes) and yield (dry mass of flower). TEQ Analytical Labs will be doing the testing for overall cannabinoid and terpenoid profiles.</p>

<p>Collection and testing of the specimens begins in February 2017. To find out the results of The Grow-Off being held in Colorado, visit <a href="http://growersnetwork.org">growersnetwork.org</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nevada: city of henderson approves first dispensary</title>
		<link>https://elevatenv.com/henderson-approves-first-dispensary/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Medical marijuana dispensary Great Basin Care won unanimous approval from the Henderson City Council and could be open as soon as this summer, <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/pot-news/henderson-approves-city-s-first-medical-pot-dispensary">reports the Las Vegas Review-Journal</a>. The dispensary will be located at 4300 E. Sunset Road.

In the same meeting the Council also approved four marijuana cultivation facilities, which will be located in industrial-zoned areas east of U.S. Highway 95.

While this is the first approved medical marijuana dispensary in Henderson, a second – Jenny’s Dispensary – is currently seeking a new location before a hearing on April 14 after its initial proposed location in a shopping center on Eastern Avenue, near retirement community Sun City Anthem, was opposed by residents. <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/pot-news/henderson-pot-dispensaries-move">Three others are also currently in the works</a> in Henderson.

Eric Hartley of the Review-Journal notes the "stark contrast" of this "drama-free" meeting to the convoluted process that the City of Las Vegas and unincorporated Clark County utilized to rank dispensary applicants independently of the State of Nevada, approving some the state did not while the state approved others that were not approved locally.

"That led to dueling lawsuits and left questions over the future of many dispensaries. Henderson prevented such disputes by waiting for the state to choose which dispensaries to approve," Hartley writes.

The <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/pot-news/clark-county-sued-over-medical-marijuana-actions">lawsuits were lobbed against Clark County</a> for trying "to force the state’s hand without regard to the state’s ranking system" to get approval for its 18 favored applicants. Only 10 applicants have gained the necessary approvals to open from both the state and the county, even though the law allows for up to 18 in unincorporated Clark County.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[MA &amp; Associates, LLC, <a href="http://www.microcapdaily.com/a-look-at-pazoo-inc-otcmktspzoo/19288/">a Las Vegas-based affiliate of Pazoo, Inc.,</a> is in the final phase of build-out of its state-of-the-art marijuana testing facility with equipment calibrated by <a href="http://steephilllab.com">Steep Hill Halent</a>, a global leader in cannabis testing and analytics that already has full-service labs in California, Colorado, and Washington.

Outside of Nevada, <a href="http://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/01/14/697335/10115502/en/Marijuana-Testing-Lab-Company-Harris-Lee-LLC-Becomes-100-Wholly-Owned-Subsidiary-of-Pazoo.html">Pazoo also now has 100 percent ownership</a> of Harris Lee, LLC, <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/pazoo-increases-stake-harris-lee-120000224.html">a company formed to set up medical marijuana testing laboratories in the United States and Canada</a>. Because marijuana is used for medicinal purposes, testing for impurities and compounds is expected to become mandatory, and Pazoo stock is considered "one to watch."

MA &amp; Associates, LLC is a marijuana grower that recently <a href="http://www.microcapdaily.com/a-look-at-pazoo-inc-otcmktspzoo/19288/">received a two-year exclusive contract with another grower</a> for 100,000 square feet of grow space with the intention of expanding its operation to 875,000 square feet of grow space within the next two years.

The Las Vegas lab is expected to be fully operational sometime in April, and the ceremonial grand opening is already planned for April 20 – 4/20, a term of significance in cannabis culture.

Growers are expected to start delivering their first product to be tested by the end of April this year.

CEO of PZOO David Cunic said in a press release, “We are very excited about how we are currently positioned in the marijuana testing industry. The combination of MA &amp; Associates, LLC within Nevada, along with Harris Lee, LLC outside Nevada, gives Pazoo the ability to focus solely on providing the most comprehensive testing criterion available, benefiting both growers and dispensaries.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It seems that the long-held popular belief that marijuana is safer than alcohol and any other recreational drug, legal or illegal, is true.

And it's not <em>just </em>true: it's true to an overwhelming extent.

<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4311234/">A recent study published in <em>Scientific Reports</em></a> shows that alcohol is more deadly than heroin or cocaine (and is, in fact, the most high-risk of all recreational drugs), while marijuana is the least risky recreational substance "by a wide margin."

Cannabis is actually 114 times <em>less</em> deadly than alcohol, which is, for those who might need a reminder, completely legal for adults ages 21 and older. Cannabis was also the only drug in the study that posed a low risk of death; the study also included heroin, cocaine, tobacco, ecstasy, and methamphetamine.

The graph really says it all:

<a href="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Untitled.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-596" src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Untitled-300x279.png" alt="Untitled" width="100%"  /></a>

It would seem marijuana is a far cry from the "deadly menace" it has been portrayed as in the past. <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/politics/marijuana-alcohol-study-safer-alcohol/">As <em>The</em> <em>Daily Dot</em> points out,</a> marijuana's continued classification as a Schedule 1 drug by the DEA, in the same category as heroin, defies all logic and is in direct contradiction to actual empirical evidence.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Assembly Bill 70, which will allow the state Department of Taxation to collect excise taxes on the sale of medical marijuana, was heard by the Assembly Taxation Committee without opposition. The bill essentially "cleaned up" some of the legal language needed for the collection of the tax previously established in the late 2013 session that authorized licensed medical marijuana dispensaries, the Review-Journal reports.

Seventy-five percent of the tax revenue collected will go directly to Nevada public schools – a system badly in need of additional outside funding sources – and the other twenty-five percent will be used by the state to operate the medical marijuana program.

Estimates of Nevada’s medical marijuana program put the amount collected in excise taxes around $10 million over the next two years, but that figure doesn't account for medical marijuana tourists from other states purchasing from Nevada dispensaries with their state-issued medical marijuana cards (the number is also based on several other "guesstimates," including the number of Nevada cardholders and frequency and dollar amount of medical marijuana purchases).

Nevada's neighboring states that currently issue medical marijuana cards – California, Oregon, and Arizona – have a collective total of about 200,000 cardholders, with Utah moving steadily forward with medical marijuana legislation of its own. Nevada currently has about 8,600 cardholders, the majority – roughly 6,200 – in Clark County. That number could potentially grow to 25,000-30,000 in Clark County alone.

No Nevada dispensaries are open yet as those granted licenses navigate local government zoning processes.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With its reputation as "Sin City," it only stands to reason that Nevada would be a front-runner in the legalization of marijuana for recreational use. 

Currently recreational marijuana has been legalized in Colorado, Washington, Washington D.C., and Alaska, while Oregon's recreational laws go into effect this July. 

Researcher Barney Warf, a professor of geography at the University of Kansas, predicts that the next five states where marijuana will be legalized for recreational use are likely to be California, Nevada, Vermont, Illinois, and New York. In regards to Nevada, he says that it shares the same libertarian mentality as Alaska, which will help to push legalization efforts forward. Additionally (though speculatively), the opportunity to make money off a potential tourism-booster is too significant for the tourism-dependent state to pass up. 

Warf is the author of "High Points: An Historical History of Cannabis," published in the peer-reviewed journal Geographical Review in September 2014, which looks specifically at the historical geography of the plant and how current laws and voter leanings can predict the future of marijuana laws in America.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On February 27, representatives from 75 Native American tribes from around the country gathered in Tulalip, Washington to discuss marijuana legalization.

After the Justice Department announced in December that it would allow the nation's Native American Tribes to legalize and regulate marijuana on their reservations, as they already do with gambling, some tribes expressed reluctance and even opposition to it, given the substance abuse problems that many reservations struggle with. But it seems like increasingly more Tribal members are becoming open to the idea of marijuana legalization, at least in some respects.

From both an economic and medical standpoint, tribes stand to benefit, and even see medicinal marijuana as a potential means of treating the very same methamphetamine and prescription drug abuse among Tribal members that initially had many concerned.

The economic potential is equally significant. <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/native-american-tribes-converge-discuss-pot-legalization-29277561?singlePage=true">According to the Associated Press</a>, Tulalip Vice Chairman Les Parks called it "a dream of another point of self-sufficiency on our reservations."

The Tribes have the autonomy to decide if they want to approve marijuana for medical or even recreational use, but there are some complications involved. Tribes must follow the same state law enforcement policies as those states that have already legalized marijuana, but there are also 17 states that have criminal jurisdiction over Tribal lands, some of which prohibit marijuana – meaning Tribal members could face criminal prosecution for trying to regulate or legalize marijuana in these states, as could non-Indian visitors who purchase marijuana on the reservation but would face legal repercussions the second they step foot outside of it. Thus, it behooves many tribes to keep their marijuana regulation laws in step with state marijuana laws.

Marijuana regulation and legalization will be a hot topic of discussion next month at the National Canter for American Indian Enterprise Development's <a href="http://res.ncaied.org">National RES</a> (Reservation Economic Summit) being held in Las Vegas March 9-12

According to the <a href="http://res.ncaied.org/national-res-las-vegas-agenda/">session description</a>, the discussion will specifically look at legal issues and potential for economic impact for the tribes: "…the DOJ's move effectively legalizes marijuana in portions of states where the drug remains otherwise outlawed. What's more, Tribes that opt to sell marijuana grown on reservations will not be subject to state and local taxes, giving them a potentially lucrative business opportunity. In states like Colorado, steep taxes on marijuana sales help fund the public school system, inflating the cost for customers." This session will delve into what all of this could mean for Tribes and Tribal business development.

The state of Nevada is home to some <a href="http://500nations.com/Nevada_Tribes.asp">28 Tribes</a>, one of which – the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe – is located within the city limits of Las Vegas. Since Nevada has already legalized marijuana for medical use and has otherwise decriminalized it, the Paiute Tribe could economically benefit from sales to local medicinal marijuana users as well as recreational use tourists, an industry with enormous untapped potential in a city with <a href="http://lasvegassun.com/news/2014/dec/17/las-vegas-breaks-own-record-40-million-visitors/">over 40 million visitors annually</a> and the <a href="http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/strip-listed-world-s-most-visited-tourist-attraction">most-visited tourist attraction in the world</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[On February 18, Barbara Humphries, along with her own group of supporters and activists, sought out Texas state Senator Jane Nelson (R-Flower Mound) seeking her support of medicinal marijuana legislation. The state currently has two medical marijuana bills that have been proposed to lawmakers, filed HB 892 and SB 339: <a href="http://www.thedailychronic.net/2015/40131/limited-cbd-only-medical-marijuana-legalization-bills-filed-in-texas/">identical legislation titled the “Texas Compassionate Use Act” that would legalize the use of low-THC, high-cannabidiol cannabis oils and tinctures for patients</a>.

<a href="http://kxan.com/2015/02/18/texas-mom-lobbies-for-medical-marijuana/">Humphries was diagnosed with cancer in 2014</a> and has undergone debilitating chemotherapy treatment over the last 10 months. She says that self-medicating with marijuana has been the only thing that has enabled her to eat and play with her kids instead of being in bed, "wasting away, emaciated, pale, throwing up all the time."

Humphries was one of <a href="http://txcann.com/2015/02/19/300-descend-on-texas-capitol-for-marijuana-lobby-day/">about 300 people</a> who descended on the Capitol in support of medical marijuana and decriminalization, including many representatives from marijuana advocacy organizations like NORML chapters from Austin, Houston, and the Dallas/Fort Worth area; the Houston-based Republicans Against Marijuana Prohibition (RAMP); and Texans for Responsible Marijuana Policy.

In addition to the two cannabidiol-only medicinal marijuana bills proposed, the state has at least seven other bills related to marijuana in consideration. These include <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=84R&amp;Bill=HB507">House Bill 507</a>, which would lower the penalty for possession of an ounce or less of marijuana from a Class B misdemeanor to a civil penalty, and <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=84R&amp;Bill=HB557">House Bill 557</a>, which would make it legal for Texas universities to grow marijuana for research purposes.

Despite seemingly strong support throughout the state, however, these bills still have a long way to go, with both the Governor and Lt. Governor, the Texas Medical Association, and the Texas Sheriff's Association among others all on record in absolute opposition of any form of medical-use legalization or decriminalization. As <em>Vice</em> stated this past December, Texas is indeed <a href="http://www.vice.com/read/texas-is-the-next-big-test-for-weed-legalization-1230">the next big test for "legal weed</a>."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Ten-year-old Alexis Carey has a rare but intractable form of epilepsy, Dravet Syndrome. The genetic disease causes severe and multiple seizures, which often leave parents guessing if the terror of watching their child seize up will pass or turn fatal.

Her Boise, Idaho, family learned that oil extracted from marijuana had helped other children and wanted to see if it would help Alexis too.

"Parent to parent, when you're in a small community and 10 people that you know are all having success, that's no longer anecdotal," Clare Carey, her mother, said. "That's hope."

But Idaho's stringent marijuana laws do not allow for medicinal use. The family began lobbying lawmakers to decriminalize the oil almost two years ago. Now, they've got some legislative backers and an upcoming hearing, as Idaho joins a larger movement to loosen laws to allow the use of marijuana extract oil.

Twelve states have legalized the oil while still banning medical marijuana. Virginia legalized the oil Feb. 26. In Utah, lawmakers have given initial approval to let those with chronic and debilitating diseases consume edible marijuana products, while still banning smoking.

Marijuana extract oil first received attention when a Colorado family fought and won for access for their daughter who also had Dravet Syndrome. It is similar to hemp oil, which is legal in Idaho and can be bought in grocery stores.

With no known cure for Dravet Syndrome, children are often prescribed a cocktail of medications to counter the seizures. However, the heavy drugs often come with side-effects that can permanently damage a child's developing liver, kidneys and other organs.

Proponents of cannabidiol oil, a non-psychotropic extract of marijuana, argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children.

<h1>Over time, Carey hopes that the oil would also reduce the number of medications her daughter relies on.</h1>

"Like any parent, you never give up hope that you can get complete seizure control," she said. "Children die from Dravet by any one of the seizures. Alexis could have a seizure that may not stop, we never really know."

Alexis began having seizures when she was two months old. But even in 2003, her mom says a lack of awareness of the disease led to many doctors not automatically suspecting it could be a rare, genetic disorder.

[caption id="attachment_132" align="alignleft" width="1024"]<img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/775673a8ab7688096f0f6a7067000557.jpg" alt="Alexis Carey, left, 10, sits with her mother Clare Carey, center, and her sister Alanis Carey, right, 5" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-499" />Alexis Carey, left, 10, sits with her mother Clare Carey, center, and her sister Alanis Carey, right, 5, on Friday, Feb. 27, 2015, in Boise, Idaho.

It wasn't until Alexis lost all speech and potty control when she was 2 that doctors determined she had Dravet Syndrome, Carey said.

Since then, Alexis' parents have put her on a variety of diets and medications to help reduce the seizures but the disease is tricky to manage. Dravet Syndrome often causes a variety of different kinds of seizures but medications typically target one particular type.

Alexis' seizures usually occur at night, which means one of her parents regularly sleep with her and monitor her sleep patterns. During the day, Alexis requires constant supervision. While most 10-year-olds freely run and jump around, Alexis walks— albeit sometimes unstably and with help going up and down stairs.

Carey says working with Idaho's Republican-controlled Legislature has been easier than anticipated.

Lawmakers who resisted the idea at first blush have warmed up to the idea, she said.

This year, the bill is endorsed by Republicans Sen. Curt McKenzie and Rep. Tom Leortscher. Both are chairs of the legislature's State Affairs Committees, panels that often get tossed controversial legislation and have a high bar for clearance.

The measure unanimously passed the Senate committee during its introduction hearing, which means it now goes on to a full hearing in front of the committee.

Yet the bill must survive a Statehouse that approved a resolution in 2013 vowing never to legalize marijuana for any purpose.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Smoking, growing and possessing marijuana becomes legal in America's wildest state Tuesday, thanks to a voter initiative aimed at clearing away 40 years of conflicting laws and court rulings.

Making Alaska the third state to legalize recreational marijuana was the goal of a coalition including libertarians, rugged individualists and small-government Republicans who prize the privacy rights enshrined in the state's constitution.

But when they voted 53-47 percent last November to legalize marijuana use by adults in private places, they left many of the details to lawmakers and regulators to sort out.

Meanwhile, Alaska Native leaders worry that legalization will bring new temptations to communities already confronting high rates of drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence and suicide.

"When they start depending on smoking marijuana, I don't know how far they'd go to get the funds they need to support it, to support themselves," said Edward Nick, council member in Manokotak, a remote village of 400 that is predominantly Yup'ik Eskimo.

<h4>Both alcohol and drug use are prohibited in Nick's village 350 miles southwest of Anchorage, even inside the privacy of villagers' homes.</h4>

But Nick fears that the initiative, in combination with a 1975 state Supreme Court decision that legalized marijuana use inside homes — could open doors to drug abuse.

Initiative backers promised Native leaders that communities could still have local control under certain conditions. Alaska law gives every community the option to regulate alcohol locally. From northern Barrow to Klawock, 1,291 miles away in southeast Alaska, 108 communities impose local limits on alcohol, and 33 of them ban it altogether.

But the initiative did not provide clear opt-out language for tribal councils and other smaller communities, forcing each one to figure out how to proceed Tuesday.

November's initiative also bans smoking in public, but didn't define what that means, and lawmakers left the question to the alcohol regulatory board, which planned to meet early Tuesday to discuss an emergency response.

In Anchorage, Alaska's largest city, officials tried and failed in December to ban a new commercial marijuana industry. But Police Chief Mark Mew said his officers will be strictly enforcing the public smoking ban. He even warned people against smoking on their porches if they live next to a park.

Other officials are still discussing a proposed cultivation ban for the wild Kenai Peninsula. But far to the north, in North Pole, smoking outdoors on private property will be OK as long as it doesn't create a nuisance, officials there said.

While the 1975 court decision protected personal marijuana possession and a 1998 initiative legalized medicinal marijuana, state lawmakers twice criminalized any possession over the years, creating an odd legal limbo.

As of Tuesday, adult Alaskans can not only keep and use pot, they can transport, grow it and give it away. A second phase, creating a regulated and taxed marijuana market, won't start until 2016 at the earliest.

<h4>And while possession is no longer a crime under state law, enjoying pot in public can bring a $100 fine.</h4>

That's fine with Dean Smith, a pot-smoker in Juneau who has friends in jail for marijuana offenses. "It's going to stop a lot of people getting arrested for nonviolent crimes," he said.

The initiative's backers warned pot enthusiasts to keep their cool.

"Don't do anything to give your neighbors reason to feel uneasy about this new law. We're in the midst of an enormous social and legal shift," organizers wrote in the Alaska Dispatch News, the state's largest newspaper.

Richard Ziegler, who had been promoting what he called "Idida-toke" in a nod to Alaska's Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, reluctantly called off his party.

There's no such pullback for former television reporter Charlo Greene, now CEO of the Alaska Cannabis Club, which is having its grand opening on Tuesday in downtown Anchorage. She's already pushing the limits, promising to give away weed to paying "medical marijuana" patients and other "club members."

Greene — who quit her job with a four-letter walkoff on live television last year to devote her efforts to passing the initiative — plans a celebratory toke at 4:20 p.m.]]></content:encoded>

The Justice Department's announcement in December that it would allow the nation's Indian tribes to legalize and regulate marijuana on their reservations brought notes of caution — if not silence or opposition — from many tribes.

They were reluctant given the substance-abuse problems that already plague many reservations.

But the attendance at a conference on the topic Friday gave an early indication of just how many might be weighing it, even if a thicket of potential legal issues remain.

Representatives of about 75 tribes from around the country converged on the Tulalip Indian Tribes' resort and casino for a $605-a-head seminar on the regulatory, legal and social issues related to pot legalization.

That's a small fraction of the nation's 566 recognized tribes. Many attendees were from smaller tribes looking for a potential economic edge.

"A great deal more are considering this than I thought would be considering it," said Ken Meshigaud, chairman of the Hannahville Indian Community, a band of the Potawatomi Tribe on Michigan's Upper Peninsula. "From an economic standpoint, it may be a good venture the tribes can get into."

Tulalip Vice Chairman Les Parks called it "a dream of another point of self-sufficiency on our reservations."

"That's what marijuana can do for us," he said.

Tribes have been wrestling with the idea since the U.S. Justice Department announced that it wouldn't stand in their way if they want to approve pot for medical or recreational use.

The agency said tribes must follow the same law enforcement priorities laid out for states that legalize the drug, including keeping marijuana out of the hands of children and criminal elements.

The discussions are heating up: On Monday, about 200 tribal leaders attended a meeting of the National Congress of American Indians, which included a closed-to-the-press panel discussion with Justice Department officials on marijuana legalization, said Demitri Downing, a former prosecutor for the Tohono O'odham tribe in southern Arizona who now advises tribes on regulatory issues related to pot.

The topic also is on the agenda of a major tribal economic summit in Las Vegas next month.

"We have to take a look at it," said Seth Pearman, an attorney for the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. "The economic opportunity is just astronomical — it would be almost negligent to miss out on this."

He said tribal leaders already are drafting regulations for a marijuana industry, and they toured some Washington state dispensaries on their trip.

The conference was organized by Robert Odawi Porter, a former president of the Seneca Nation in New York, and Seattle marijuana business attorneys Hilary Bricken and Robert McVay.

Porter noted that difficult legal issues remain, especially related to tribal sovereignty. About 17 states have some criminal jurisdiction over tribal lands. If tribes are in those states, and those states prohibit marijuana, tribal members could face state criminal prosecution if they legalize or regulate marijuana, he said.

Several tribes stressed they are proceeding cautiously and reluctant to outpace changes in state marijuana laws. For example, tribes might not want to legalize for recreational use if it's illegal off-reservation, said Chris Stearns, a Navajo and the chairman of the Washington State Gambling Commission.

"They can sell to non-Indians, but the second they leave the reservation they get arrested," Stearns said. "That's not a great business model."

The tribal council of the 3,200-member Hoopa Valley Tribe, in Northern California's famed Emerald Triangle, has requested recommendations from health, law enforcement and other tribal officials to consider the consequences of marijuana legalization, including whether it might jeopardize federal aid for health care, fire services or housing, said Councilman Brad Marshall.

Some tribes said they would first consider regulating cannabis for medical use. They said they were intrigued about the idea that making pot more accessible might help cut down on abuse of methamphetamine or prescription drugs among tribal members.

"We're looking at what the benefits are, not only with revenue but with the medical relief we can give to our elders," said Lewis Taylor, chairman of the St. Croix Tribe of Wisconsin.]]></content:encoded>

Defying threats from Congress, the District of Columbia legalized possession of marijuana for recreational purposes on Thursday, becoming the first place east of the Mississippi River with legal pot.

The new law took effect at 12:01 a.m., despite last-minute maneuvers by Republican leaders in Congress and threats that city leaders could face prison time. Democratic Mayor Muriel Bowser, who took office in January, said it was her duty to implement the initiative city voters approved overwhelmingly in November.

"This is a major milestone on the road to ending marijuana prohibition in the United States," said Robert Capecchi of the Marijuana Policy Project, which advocates for legalization. "If the president can brew and drink beer in the White House, adults should be allowed to grow and consume a less harmful substance in their houses."

Possession of up to 2 ounces of pot for use at home is now legal, and people are also permitted to grow up to three mature plants. Smoking marijuana in public remains illegal, as does buying or selling the drug.

On Tuesday, Alaska also implemented a voter initiative legalizing the private use, sharing and cultivation of recreational pot, but lawmakers there won't implement the next phase — creating a regulated market where legal marijuana can be sold and taxed — until 2016 at least.

The District's initiative, approved by 65 percent of the voters in November, only addressed personal possession, not taxation or regulation, and District leaders acknowledge that Congress blocked any effort to implement a legal marijuana market. But they believe Congress acted too late to stop legalization for private use.

[caption id="attachment_132" align="alignleft" width="1024"]<img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/a58231e307ce2d096f0f6a706700970a.jpg" alt="Posters encouraging people to vote yes on DC Ballot Initiative 71 to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use are readied in Washington" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-499" />Posters encouraging people to vote yes on DC Ballot Initiative 71 to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use are readied in Washington.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican who chairs the House Oversight Committee, urged Bowser in a letter late Tuesday to reconsider. He said that the mayor and any other district employees who spend money or time implementing any aspect of the initiative could face prison time for violating federal law.

"The penalties are severe, and we're serious about this. Nobody's wishing or wanting that to happen, but the law is clear," Chaffetz told the AP.

Bowser responded sharply even as she tried to ratchet down the conflict.

"Bullying the District of Columbia is not what his constituents expect, nor do ours," Bowser said. "We do disagree on a matter of law. There are reasonable ways to resolve that without us threatening him or he us."

It would be up to the Justice Department, not Congress, to prosecute District officials, and that scenario appears unlikely. However, Congress could sue the city, and House Republicans also could retaliate by pulling federal funding for city programs.

Rep. Mark Meadows, a Republican from North Carolina, co-signed the letter to Bowser late Tuesday, which warned that by spending money to change pot laws, District officials would violate the Anti-Deficiency Act, which prohibits spending of unappropriated federal dollars. The oversight committee also demanded to see all District documents detailing money spent and time put in by city employees to implement the initiative.

No one has ever been convicted of violating the Anti-Deficiency Act, although city and federal workers and agencies have been punished administratively for violations.

Jamie Raskin, a constitutional law professor at American University, characterized the threat of criminal prosecution as "a lot of huffing and puffing on Capitol Hill."

"The real power Congress has is the power of the purse," said Raskin, who also serves as a Democratic state senator in Maryland. "They can exact their retribution financially against the District."

Congress hasn't struck down a specific city law in 25 years. Instead, members often add language to critical pieces of federal legislation to undo city policies they don't like. The language on pot was included in a spending bill President Barack Obama signed to keep the government running.]]></content:encoded>

A panel of Utah lawmakers gave initial approval Thursday to a proposal that would allow residents of the conservative state who have chronic and debilitating diseases to consume edible medical marijuana products.

The legislation forbids the smoking of marijuana, but allows businesses to grow marijuana and sell pot-infused products such as brownies, candy and lozenges.

A Senate committee voted 3-2 to approve the bill and send it to the full Senate after a nearly two-hour debate about the legal and moral dangers of allowing a medical marijuana program in the heavily Mormon state.

Woods Cross Republican Sen. Todd Weiler said he recently traveled to Nevada, where a medical marijuana law has passed and he saw a billboard with a giant pot leaf on it.

"It said, 'Call Dr. Weed' and a phone number. Is that what we're bringing to Utah?" he said before casting one of the two dissenting votes.

Saratoga Springs Republican Sen. Mark Madsen, who sponsored the bill, said if the state can push past years of propaganda and misunderstanding surrounding the drug, it would bring compassion and freedom to those who are suffering. He also said medical pot has become a states' right issue to push back against federal overreach.

Madsen has said he began researching the issue after having back pain for years. When his doctor recently recommended a marijuana treatment, Madsen traveled to Colorado to try it through cannabis-infused gummy bears and an electronic-cigarette device.

He said he found the treatment effective. If his doctor agrees it would let him use fewer or no prescription painkillers, he'd consider taking a cannabis product again.

"This bill introduces a very small element of highly regulated freedom to willing patients and willing doctors," Madsen said.

The bill passed its first test in the Utah Legislature at a time when a growing number of states are allowing the drug. Alaska and the District of Columbia became the latest places to legalize the drug this week after several states in recent years adopted medical marijuana.

Thursday's hearing included testimony from law enforcement and several people suffering from cancer and other diseases.

Christine Stenquist of Kaysville told lawmakers she has been living with a brain tumor and fibromyalgia for 20 years. Three years ago, she began using marijuana and said she is no longer housebound, doesn't need a cane, and can volunteer and be a mother to her children again.

"At 42 years old, I finally have a life — the life I had to give up on," Stenquist said.

Matt Fairbanks, a Utah-based special agent with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, spoke against the bill, telling lawmakers he has seen large crops of illegal pot grown on Utah mountainsides, leaving the environment destroyed from pesticides and erosions.

"The deforestation has left marijuana growths with even rabbits that have cultivated a taste for the marijuana," Fairbanks said.

Madsen said his proposal would only allow for indoor growing operations, with seed-to-sale tracking, testing and regulation.

Patients would be issued medical marijuana cards that would serve as their prescription and as a debit card to process their payments for the drug. The proposal specifies which conditions are eligible, such as AIDS, cancer and post-traumatic stress disorder.

Madsen said he is confident his bill will pass the GOP-controlled state Senate, and he's reasonably optimistic about its chances in the Republican-dominated House.

The House speaker and Utah's Republican governor have said they fear a medical marijuana law would lead to legalized recreational pot or broad use through suspect prescriptions.

At his monthly news conference on Thursday, Gov. Gary Herbert said medical marijuana needs science behind it, "and it has to have dispensing where real doctors, not just Dr. Feelgood, is dispensing the medication in a controlled way."]]></content:encoded>

		<title>New Hampshire: house votes to remove criminal penalties for marijuana possession</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The New Hampshire House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill 297-67 Wednesday that would remove criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana. The measure will now be considered in the Senate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We’re pleased to see such strong legislative support for this important legislation,” said Matt Simon, Goffstown-based New England political director for the Marijuana Policy Project. “We hope the Senate will agree with their colleagues in the House and the vast majority of state voters that it’s time to stop criminalizing people for simple marijuana possession.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">HB 618, sponsored by Rep. Adam Schroadter (R-Newmarket) and a bipartisan group of seven co-sponsors, would make possession of up to one-half ounce of marijuana punishable by a civil fine of $100 for a first offense, $200 for a second offense, and up to $500 for third or subsequent offenses. Currently, possession of any amount of marijuana is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $2,000. New Hampshire is the only state in New England that treats simple marijuana possession as a criminal offense with the potential for jail time. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Nobody should face jail time and a permanent criminal record just for possessing a substance that is far less harmful than alcohol,” Simon said. “Granite Staters do not want their state government to continue wasting its resources on enforcing such an unfair and outdated policy. Hopefully our state senators and governor will respect that and move forward with this legislation.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Three out of five adults in New Hampshire (61%) support removing criminal penalties for marijuana possession, according to a WMUR Granite State Poll released in April 2014. Only 24% said they were opposed.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have removed the threat of jail for simple marijuana possession.</span></p>

		<title>Vermont: bill introduced to regulate and tax marijuana like alcohol</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">State Rep. Chris Pearson (P-Burlington) introduced a bill Tuesday that would regulate and tax marijuana like alcohol in Vermont. Nine co-sponsors have signed on to H. 277, which mirrors S. 95, the Senate bill introduced last week by Sen. David Zuckerman (P-Chittenden).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“There is a lot of support among legislators and the public for ending marijuana prohibition in Vermont,” said Matt Simon, New England Political director for the Marijuana Policy Project, which is part of the Vermont Coalition to Regulate Marijuana. “It is never too soon to replace a failed, antiquated policy with a more sensible, evidence-based approach. If it’s the right thing to do, the right time to do it is now.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">H. 277 and S. 95 would allow adults 21 years of age and older to possess up to one ounce of marijuana; grow up to two flowering marijuana plants and seven non-flowering plants in a secure indoor location; and possess the marijuana yielded from those plants at the same location. It would remain illegal to consume marijuana in public or drive while impaired by marijuana.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Department of Public Safety would be directed to license and regulate marijuana retail stores, lounges, cultivation facilities, product manufacturing facilities, and testing laboratories. Localities would have the ability to regulate or prohibit marijuana businesses within their borders. The bill would also establish an adjustable excise tax on wholesale transfers (such as those from a cultivation facility to a retail store) of flowers ($40 per ounce), trim ($15 per ounce), and plants ($25 per seedling).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Legislators have a decision to make,” Simon said. “Vermont can either continue to force marijuana cultivation and sales into the underground market, or bring it above board and start controlling it. As they consider this proposal, we hope lawmakers will keep in mind the fact that marijuana is a far less harmful substance than alcohol.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A strong majority (57%) of Vermonters support making marijuana legal for adults, taxing it, and regulating it similarly to alcohol, according to a Castleton Polling Institute survey released in May. The results are available at <a href="http://www.mpp.org/VTpoll"><span class="s2">http://www.mpp.org/VTpoll</span></a>.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">West Virginia Sen. Majority Leader Mitch Carmichael (R-Ripley) introduced a bill today that would allow state residents with debilitating medical conditions, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis, and HIV/AIDS, to grow and use medical marijuana if their doctors recommend it. The bill, known as SB 546, would establish a state-regulated system of medical marijuana cultivation facilities and dispensaries to provide medical marijuana to licensed patients. The bill, which is co-sponsored by Senate Minority Leader Jeffrey Kessler (D-Glen Dale) and Senate Majority Whip Daniel Hall (R-Oceana), has been introduced and referred to the Senate Committee on Health and Human Resources.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Marijuana has proven effective in treating a number of serious medical conditions and is far safer than many currently prescribed medications,” said Matt Simon, a legislative analyst for the Marijuana Policy Project, who is a West Virginia native and graduate of West Virginia University. “No one deserves to be treated like a criminal for using marijuana to treat a serious medical condition.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“West Virginians deserve the chance to use this medicine if their doctors think that it will help,” Simon said. “It's time to stop criminalizing patients for using a treatment option that can dramatically improve their quality of life.”</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Twenty-three states, Guam, and the District of Columbia have adopted laws that allow people with certain debilitating medical conditions to use medical marijuana if their doctors recommend it.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[About half of NFL players smoke pot and virtually every single player in the league has a certifiable need for medical marijuana.

At least that's the opinion of former Denver Broncos tight end <a href="http://www.nfl.com/player/natejackson/2504808/profilehttp://" title="Nate Jackson NFL PLayer" target="_blank">Nate Jackson</a>, who used marijuana instead of prescription medication to manage his daily pain during his six-year NFL career.

"Marijuana allowed me to be an elite athlete and I didn't get addicted to pain pills," Jackson said. "A lot of guys prefer (pot). They've been smoking weed since high school. The fact you're in the <a href="http://www.nfl.com/" title="NFL" target="_blank">NFL</a> at all means you have your marijuana use under control."
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/books/slow-getting-up-nate-jacksons-nfl-memoir.html?_r=0" title="Slow Getting Up,’ Nate Jackson’s N.F.L. Memoir" target="_blank">
<img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Elevate-May-Issue_Page_11_Image_0002-198x300.jpg" alt="Elevate May Issue_Page_11_Image_0002" width="198" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-756" /></a>Jackson, who retired from professional football in 2010 after tearing his hamstring off the bone in training camp with the <a href="http://www.ufl-football.com/las-vegas-locomotives" title="Las Vegas Locomotives" target="_blank">Las Vegas Locomotives</a> of the now-defunct <a href="http://www.ufl-football.com/" title="UFL" target="_blank">United Football League</a>, believes the NFL should and eventually will remove marijuana from its list of banned substances.

"I hope the NFL powers-that-be look to the country's shifting sensibilities about the plant with an open mind and allow players to medicate themselves how they see fit," Jackson, 35, said. "I think the NFL will come around. Studies show that marijuana helps the brain recover from brain injuries. If that all comes to light, it will."

Jackson, who had two touchdown catches in 43 games for the <a href="http://www.denverbroncos.com/" title="Broncos" target="_blank">Broncos</a> from 2003 to 2008, said attitudes about marijuana use have already softened among NFL coaching staffs.

"Coaches are well aware their players smoke weed. Teams thoroughly vet guys when they're scouting. They know marijuana is a big part of their players' lives," he said. "They prefer guys smoke weed and go home and play video games than go out drunk driving."

Jackson suffered a slew of injuries during his career that he documented in his critically acclaimed 2013 memoir, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Slow-Getting-Up-Survival-Bottom-ebook/dp/B00BATG1AS" title="Slow Getting Up: A Story of NFL Survival from the Bottom of the Pile By Nate Jackson" target="_blank">Slow Getting Up: A Story of NFL Survival from the Bottom of the Pile.</a>"

He broke his leg, dislocated his shoulder, separated both shoulders, tore his groin off the bone once, tore his hamstring off the bone twice, broke fingers and ribs, tore the medial collateral ligament in his knee and more.

Jackson, who beat some long odds by reaching the NFL from a tiny Division III school -- <a href="http://www.menlo.edu/" title="Menlo College" target="_blank">Menlo College</a> -- in his native California, also suffered concussions during his career. He believes marijuana not only helped him manage his pain but helped heal his brain.

"I truly think it helps with pain," he said. "What do pain pills do? They don't heal injury. They change the pain sensors in your mind. I think marijuana has a similar effect on the body. It has a therapeutic effect on the brain and it can be said that football players constantly deal with brain injuries.

"I came out of the NFL with my wits intact. I feel pretty sharp, motivated and smart, and I know I medicated with marijuana all the time. I think it helps the football brain."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Declared the rock n’ roll chef by Rolling Stone magazine, Kerry Simon was used to making splashy press announcements and hosting glamorous VIP openings for his always-on-the-culinary-cutting-edge restaurants located in hot spots as far away as the Dominican Republic and as close as the several he owned right here in his home base of Las Vegas.

In December 2013 he would again make headlines but it was to be a much different kind of news story. Kerry would share with the world that he had been diagnosed with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) – causing the renowned chef to experience a much different kind of fanfare.

Kerry would become the face of the little-known disease that is a more severe and aggressive form of Parkinson’s and affects only about four in 100,000 people. MSA is a very rare degenerative neurological disorder associated with nerve cells in specific areas of the brain. This cell degeneration causes problems with movement, balance, and other autonomic functions of the body such as bladder control and blood-pressure regulation. At this time, there is no cure for MSA and no known way to prevent the disease from getting worse. The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms.

And that’s where our story begins.

But not before I explain the parameters of my interview with Kerry which took place on February 10 at his home. Once an avid runner and biker well-known for living a healthy lifestyle, Kerry is now confined to a wheelchair and his speech so impaired and garbled that one of his caregivers, Jason Strange, a longtime friend who is not a nurse and does not have any medical training, did most of the talking regarding Kerry’s use of medicinal marijuana. One of Kerry’s business partners, Ari Farah, was also present during our February 10th interview to discuss some of the chef’s related investment interests in a dispensary.

I also spoke with Kerry’s movement specialist Peter Pinto on March 20, who offered his observations of Kerry’s physical condition. In addition, I interviewed Kerry’s nurse manager who wished to not be identified. Kerry’s physician at Lou Ruvo Brain Center for Brain Health/Cleveland Clinic, Dr. Ryan Walsh...

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ingredients:</strong>
1 pound of ripe avocados, remove skin and pits
4 ounces maple syrup
4 tablespoons sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
1/2 teaspoon soy sauce
1 cup cocoa powder
1 1/2 tablespoons cocoa butter melted
1 1/2 tablespoons THC/CBD butter melted

cocoa powder until smooth and creamy. Add cocoa powder
gradually and blend until smooth.
Chill for one hour. Serve with your favorite tropical fruit or berries.

*Please remember that when you cook with medical cannabis you are cooking with a drug and the amounts and sizes of the drug and portions of the food ingested should always be taken into consideration. Always start out with small portions or doses and wait 30 minutes to an hour before eating any additional portions.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[First, a confession: I loathe recreational marijuana. I don't like the smell of it, and it pains me to see people hacking up a lung after having smoked it. ("This stuff never makes me cough, I swear!") I also don't like how anti-social it is, sending people outside to smoke while I sip my wine indoors alone.

Some might think this makes me an unlikely advocate for its legalization in either medicinal or recreational form. And it does, I guess, because I do not, in any way, shape or form, exactly approve of ingesting marijuana for fun. It's just not my thing. But I also don't think that matters at all in today's current state of affairs. And thus we wade into politics, starting with one particular incident -- in our nation's fine capital, no less -- that has me all riled up.

It's no secret that our government isn't winning popularity contests these days, with more and more voters throwing up their hands and staying home from the polls rather than pick either party. And one issue that really makes my blood boil: when smug politicians pit themselves against those Americans who do make it to the polls. So a recent kerfuffle in Washington, D.C. has me in an irate state of mind.
<a href="http://dcmj.org/ballot-initiative/" title="Initiative 71" target="_blank">
Initiative 71</a> passed last November in Washington, D.C., legalizing small amounts of marijuana. A whopping 70 percent of voters voted for it, and yet Congress immediately tried to block it, using a spending bill, of all things, as a shield.

It made headlines across the country, causing Americans again to stop and consider how our "democracy" is really defined. I mean, what's the point of voting if the government (who, let's face it, no one trusts anymore) can just "override" the vote of the people based on politics?

So Washington, D.C. found itself in a pickle.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The state of New Jersey has recently added PTSD as one of the qualifying illnesses for a medicinal marijuana card. The resolution (ACR-224) approved in a 44-20 vote would also reverse the requirement that a list be made public of all physicians willing to recommend patients to the program -- a step that has kept some doctors from joining out of fear they will alienate other patients or partners.]]></content:encoded>

"This is a very important bill," said Sen. Bill Dotzler, D-Waterloo, before a 9-5 vote by the Senate Ways and Means Committee that would authorize the production and dispensing of medical cannabis for expanded uses and medical conditions. "People's lives, I believe, are at stake and their health and well-being is at stake."]]></content:encoded>

The Senate's unanimous vote and the House's 36-13 vote in May comes 15 years after state leaders authorized the prescription and use of medical marijuana but did not establish a dispensary system to provide access to the drug.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Democratic State Senator Tick Segerblom sponsored a bill that would allow pet owners to get medicinal marijuana for their pet if their veterinarian certifies the animal has an illness that might be alleviated by the drug. The proposal is in its earliest stages and faces several legislative hurdles before it could become law. The pot-for-pets provision of SB372 is part of a larger bill that would overhaul the state's medical marijuana law, removing penalties for drivers who have marijuana in their blood and requiring training for dispensary owners.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hundreds of city residents lined up for "seed share" -- an exchange program that helps cannabis enthusiasts grow it at home. "It really does mark the conclusion of the D.C. Cannabis Campaign. We've accomplished our goals. It's simply about the people who have been buying marijuana from the underground economy," Adam Eidinger, head of the D.C. Cannabis Campaign, said. "If they grow it, sometime later this year they won't have to buy it anymore from the underground economy."]]></content:encoded>

The opening allows residents to buy cannabis from an authorized shop in San Diego for the first time since California voters approved the use of medical marijuana in 1996. San Diego joins nearly 50 other cities in California that offer a process to legitimize medical marijuana dispensaries, but it is the only city in this county to do so.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a storied and colorful 15-year history, Nevadans have gained the constitutional right to use medicinal marijuana. However, because of all the twists and turns the law has taken over the last 15+ years, many patients do not clearly understand what they are permitted to do and might get lost on their travels as they seek to find relief from medical marijuana.

The journey of medicinal marijuana in Nevada began in 2000 when a <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/const/nvconst.html" title="THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE OF NEVADA" target="_blank">constitutional amendment</a> was approved by 65 percent of the state's voters. The amendment gave patients the legal right to use marijuana as medication. In 2001, the Nevada State Legislature jumped on the bandwagon and passed a law that created a system for qualifying patients to obtain a registry identification card to use medicinal marijuana for certain chronic and debilitating conditions.The law also permitted a patient to designate a caregiver.

<strong>To qualify as a patient one must:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Be a <a href="http://www.dmvnv.com/newresident.htm" title="Nevada Residency Requirements" target="_blank">resident of Nevada</a></li>
	<li>Be in the care of a <a href="http://www.medboard.nv.gov/" title="Nevada licensed physician" target="_blank">Nevada licensed physician</a></li>
	<li>Be diagnosed with a chronic or debilitating condition including: AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, cachexia, persistent muscle spasms, seizures, severe nausea and severe pain</li>
	<li>Receive a recommendation stating that medical marijuana could mitigate the symptoms of the chronic or debilitating condition</li>
	<li>Register with <a href="http://www.health.nv.gov/" title="Nevada's Department of Public and Behavioral Health" target="_blank">Nevada's Department of Public and Behavioral Health</a></li>
	<li>Obtain a valid <a href="http://health.nv.gov/MedicalMarijuana.htm" title="Medical Marijuana Card" target="_blank">registry identification card</a></li>
</ul>



A patient cannot be a caregiver and a <a href="http://elevatenv.com/how-to-become-your-childs-medical-marijuana-caregiver/" title="How to become a caregiver" target="_blank">caregiver</a> can only be a caregiver to one cardholder. Furthermore, if the patient is under the age of 18, the patient's custodial parent or guardian must give permission for the patient to obtain a medical marijuana registry identification card.

Despite the groundbreaking effort taken in 2000 by the voters that paved the way for the law in 2001, the medical marijuana road came to a dead end. Patients had no way to obtain or access medical marijuana except for growing at home -- assuming, of course, they were able to navigate around the detour of legally obtaining seeds or clones without crossing state lines or purchasing from another patient.

For several years, patients had a constitutional right that they were not able to exercise and it was not until 2013 that the Nevada State Legislature decided to complete construction on the medical marijuana highway. In 2013, the Nevada Legislature passed amendments to the law that allowed for medical marijuana dispensaries to open and legally sell medical marijuana to Nevada patients (and out-of-state patients) who hold a valid medical marijuana card.

Although the path to legal dispensaries has been filled with potholes, legal medical marijuana dispensaries are anticipated to open in the fall of 2015, if not sooner. A qualified patient will be able to purchase up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana every 14 days. Furthermore, dispensaries can sell patients edibles and/or tinctures that have the same amount (up to 2.5 ounces every 14 days) of usable marijuana.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Charlotte's Web is a sativa marijuana strain that has gained popularity as an option for treating epileptic seizures. Charlotte's Web's medical potency is due to its high CBD content, which was specifically cultivated by a pair of Colorado breeders, the Stanley Brothers, for a young epileptic patient named Charlotte. Charlotte's Web is believed to be the highest CBD strain in the world with 20 percent CBD and less than 0.5 percent THC. As of September 2014, Charlotte’s Web Hemp Oil can legally be shipped to all 50 states because the oil contains less than the maximum THC allowed for food products, according to federal hemp legislation. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theroc.us">www.theroc.us</a>

Made by the Stanley Brothers in Colorado, Charlotte's Web, due to its feature on CNN's 2013 "Weed" documentary, is the most popular and well-known of the CBD oils children with epilepsy take. "From The New York Times and CNN to People and National Geographic, the nation has paid attention to these families and their plight," Heather Jackson at Realm of Caring Foundation, a nonprofi t providing support for families using cannabinoid products, explains of Charlotte’s Web popularity. "The ratio of CBD versus THC in Charlotte’s Web is about 26:1 right now," Jackson explains of the medicine that is currently supplied to 4,000 families. "They are working at the lab to have even higher ratios of up to 200:1 in the future." As for Nevadans interested in Charlotte’s Web, it is available. "Because it was grown under the hemp program here, it is being shipped to Nevada families," reports Jackson. Additionally, when the dispensaries open in Nevada, CWNevada is the Stanley Brothers' Nevada partner and has exclusive rights to Charlotte's Web here in the state.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Harlequin is a 75/25 sativa-dominant strain renowned for its reliable expression of CBD. A descendant of Colombian Gold, Thai, and a Swiss landrace strain, users depend on Harlequin to provide clear-headed, alert sativa effects. Unlike most high CBD strains, Harlequin almost always develops a CBD:THC ratio of 5:2, making this strain one of the most effective for treatment of pain and anxiety, as CBD counteracts THC’s paranoia while amplifying its painkilling properties. Harlequin is well known for its ability to relax without sedation, and to relieve without intoxication. www.medicalseeds.com]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sour Tsunami is a strain that became popular because it was one of the first to be specifically bred for high CBD rather than THC content. The result is a strain that’s effective at treating pain and inflammation without producing a significant “high” that is linked to high THC. Sour Tsunami CBD levels test as high as 10 or 11 percent, while THC is usually under 10 percent. www.kingofcbdgenetics.com]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>ELEVATION PUBLISHING HOSTS LAUNCH PARTY TO INTRODUCE NEW MEDICINAL CANNABIS PUBLICATION TO NEVADA MARKETPLACE</strong>
<em>Photography by Jeff Ragazzo</em>

Months in creation and development, Elevate Nevada, the state's first medicinal cannabis magazine, was introduced on April 24 with a launch party at <a title="Chayo Mexican Kitchen and Tequila Bar " href="http://www.chayolv.com/" target="_blank">Chayo Mexican Kitchen</a> in the <a href="https://www.caesars.com/linq" title="The Linq" target="_blank">LINQ</a> Promenade. Movers and shakers from the medicinal cannabis community including dispensary and laboratory owners as well as cultivation experts, scientists, caregivers and supporters celebrated the magazine’s inaugural issue.

"We had a great turnout and were pleased to see the overwhelming support offered by the medicinal cannabis community for the magazine that is going to change the way people view medicinal marijuana," said Guy Bertuzzi, publisher of Elevate Nevada.

A big part of the night’s celebration was the cover of <a title="Inaugural Issue of Elevate NV" href="http://issuu.com/elevatenv/docs/elevate_may_issue_no_bleed?e=15520179/12888241" target="_blank">Elevate Nevada's inaugural issue</a> which featured rock n’ roll chef Kerry Simon who is using Phoenix Tears, a form of medicinal cannabis, to help with the debilitating effects of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA).

"We were very pleased to have the opportunity to tell <a title="Kerry's Story" href="http://elevatenv.com/kerry-simon-takes-charge-of-his-course-charting-a-new-roadmap-to-beat-multiple-system-atrophy-using-medicinal-cannabis/" target="_blank">Kerry's story</a>," Jonathan Fine, president of Elevation Publishing, explained. "Stories like Kerry's are the reason we are publishing this magazine. Whether it is for <a title="PTSD" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/basics/definition/con-20022540" target="_blank">PTSD</a>, the side effects of cancer, <a title="MSA" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-system-atrophy/basics/definition/con-20027096" target="_blank">MSA</a> or childhood <a title="Epilepsy" href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/home/ovc-20117206" target="_blank">epilepsy</a>, we need to share the stories of people who are finding relief through the healing properties of medicinal cannabis."

In honor of the magazine’s first cover, Chef Robert "Teddy" Thompson of M. Antoinette cakes and confections created a pastry masterpiece using the magazine's inaugural cover to top a cake that appeared to be a stack of magazines. Thompson also created white chocolate covered petit fours filled with chocolate ganache and raspberries featuring the magazine's signature e logo to display around the cake.

In addition to the specially made confections, guests nibbled on Chayo's sweet corn empanadas, shrimp ceviche, mini chorizo sopes, and chicken enchiladas while sampling signature cocktails called the Conversation Starter and Cottonmouth Cure concocted with Deep Eddy Vodka.

The evening's festivities also included a raffle with all of the proceeds going to Kerry Simon's Fight MSA charity, <a title="Fight MSA" href="http://www.fightmsa.org" target="_blank">www.fightmsa.org</a>. Launch event sponsors were Ace Analytical Laboratory and <a title="Evergreen Organix" href="http://www.evergreenorganix.com/" target="_blank">Evergreen Organix</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>[dropcap]S[/dropcap]ometimes we find hope in places we don't expect it to be. This is the story of one family's five-year journey to find their child relief from the ravaging effects of nightly seizures. From visiting the finest pediatric neurologists in the country to taking a chance on a plant, Jon and Sandi Spadafora stopped at nothing to find a way to make their daughter, Avery, whole again.</strong>

[quote]Although Avery Spadafora was born five weeks before her due date in November 2008, her parents had no indication that she was going to be anything other than a perfectly normal, healthy child.[/quote]

"We brought her home from the hospital as a very well behaved baby who appeared to be happy and healthy," explains Avery's father, Jon Spadafora. "After getting her home, we realized that she slept a lot more than our other children had but, with two older children in the house, we understood that babies are unique and we didn't worry about it."

However, as the months went by, Jon and Sandi Spadafora began to grow concerned as Avery missed key developmental milestones. By the time Avery was eight months old, the Las Vegas couple was getting used to spending hours meeting with various specialists who were trying to determine what was wrong with their little girl.

But before they found an answer, when Avery was 18 months old, she had her first seizure. "She was taking a nap in her stroller during our Fourth of July party and to say that it took us by surprise is an understatement," says Jon.

[caption id="attachment_141" align="alignright" width="614"]<a href="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image10.jpeg"><img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/image10.jpeg" alt="image10" width="960" height="1280" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1106" /></a>Her first seizure. "Perhaps the worst of all was that we were watching milestones that Avery was gaining – the ability to play peek-a-boo or making a 'mmmm' sound when she wanted her mom – disappear. We were concerned that the seizures were the reasons she seemed to lose these things that she worked very hard to gain.[/caption]

In their quest to help Avery, the Spadaforas took her to see the best neurologists in the country, visiting Boston Children's, Texas Children's, Colorado Children's, and UCLA. "My wife took it upon herself to learn what was causing Avery's seizures and orchestrated visits to some of the best pediatric neurologists around the country in the hope that one of them would take a special interest in our child and help us to understand what was happening so that we could treat and help her," explains Jon.

"We were always nervous as we walked into these gigantic research hospitals, hoping that the answer was at the top of the elevator. We always left with the same disappointed feeling after we watched our daughter being poked with needles, enduring overnight EEGs, sleep studies, MRIs, and what seemed like endless tests, only to be told that her condition did not fit the definition of any the doctor was familiar with."

While looking for answers, a geneticist at UCLA introduced the Spadaforas to Dr. Shaun Hussain, a pediatric epilepsy specialist at UCLA. Not liking the medical options available in Las Vegas, the Spadaforas chose Dr. Hussain to become Avery's neurologist and guide the family through the maze of available seizure medications.

"Without a clear diagnosis on the type of seizures that Avery was experiencing, it was challenging for him to identify the right medicine to treat them. So we tried them all. Some helped for a short period of time, some were promising and some were scary, but at the end of the day none of them were the answer," Jon remembers. "It was increasingly frustrating to leave her appointments without answers as we watched the frequency and intensity of her nighttime seizures increase."

Avery would have on average between one and four seizures per night with some lasting 45 seconds and others lasting up to 45 minutes. "The stress on our family seemed to increase each month, as Avery, my wife, and I failed to sleep for entire nights at a time. They got so bad that Avery's siblings would hear her and wake up to sit with my wife or I as we tried to calm her down.

We were concerned that the seizures were the reasons she seemed to lose these things that she worked very hard to gain."

In April 2014, Dr. Hussain told the Spadaforas that they had run through the majority of the seizure medications that he could recommend and there were only a few options left that could help Avery. He gave them three choices: a Ketogenic diet, a lobotomy or a new experimental drug called Fycompa that was coming onto the market.

The Ketogenic diet would have required a feeding tube and hospitalization to implement so "obviously that is very challenging to stick with," offers Jon. As for the lobotomy that would potentially cut out the part of Avery's brain that caused the seizures, Jon was adamant. "Sandi and I both felt like that was a definite no from the get-go."

Having just seen a news story about a family who used a form of medicinal cannabis called CBD oil with much success, Sandi asked Dr. Hussain's opinion on it and whether it was a possibility he would consider. (Cannabidiol (CBD) is one of over 60 cannabis compounds that is well suited as an anti-spasmodic and, unlike THC, does not cause a high.)

"He was very honest and told us that while UCLA would not allow him to recommend it; he believed it might be an option to consider after the experimental drug," Jon recalls. "Sandi was pushing for it (the CBD oil) but I was more skeptical. My only concern was there was not a tremendous amount of research on either side."

[quote align="right"]Upon leaving UCLA, the couple decided to try the experimental drug Dr. Hussain suggested, and if that didn't work, they would find a way to start using CBD oil.[/quote]

For the next couple of months Avery took Fycompa. "It never really worked to control the episodes, but we saw enough of a reduction in the frequency and intensity that it felt like a break. Then sometime during the middle of the summer they came back with a vengeance," Jon summarizes Avery's experience. 

The failure of Fycompa was the impetus for Sandi and Jon to start the process of looking for CBD oil to treat Avery's epilepsy. Unfortunately for the Spadaforas, there were some pretty big logistical challenges for them to overcome. First, they lived in Las Vegas where medicinal cannabis was not available. Next, CBD oil was almost impossible to get as very few places were actually selling it. Finally, they didn't know if it would actually work.

In August 2014, they began their quest for CBD oil with not much more than determination, resourcefulness and luck -- taking a road trip to visit Sandi's sister in Denver where they hoped to secure Avery's red card which is required for a minor to use medicinal cannabis in Colorado. 

Remembering the news story she had seen on CBD oil, Sandi recalled the doctor's name in Colorado who was mentioned by CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Sanjay Gupta, searched for him on the internet and called him. Although he wasn't available, Dr. Shackelford's receptionist advised Sandi that she needed to get a Colorado driver's license and appointments with two doctors who could give her prescriptions for medicinal cannabis.

Jon is self-employed so he was able to cut himself a check using a Colorado address to get his driver's license. Then it was down the rabbit hole to doctor's offices, both professional and unprofessional, that could sign off on Avery's need for CBD oil. 

"The first doctor's office was as we hoped it would be, professional and filled with people who really wanted to help people that the system has dubbed helpless," says Jon. "The next was a nightmare, operating out of what appeared to be an abandoned office building, with a waiting room full of all the characters from a pamphlet distributed by a politician against medical marijuana. We left the appointment confused and feeling like we were making a mistake to let our six-year-old daughter take anything prescribed by this place."

In spite of their misgivings, the Spadaforas soldiered on to their next stop – a cultivator that Dr. Shackelford had recommended to them who might be able to fill Avery's prescription. "We had an appointment with the H.O.P.E. Foundation shortly afterward, and decided to keep it, since we had already come so far. Even though we were not sure what to think when the GPS gave us the address of a home, we made the trek to Longmont," explains Jon of the cultivator. 

The couple had opted for a medicine created by Jason Cranford,  founder of the Flowering H.O.P.E. Foundation, called Haleigh's Hope over the more well-known Charlotte's Web, made popular by Sanjay Gupta's "Weed" documentary on CNN, because it had a lengthy waiting list of 8,000 people. (Editor's note: As of February 2015, there was no longer a wait list for Charlotte's Web hemp oil.) 

The team at Flowering H.O.P.E. Foundation explained the process of receiving and administering the medicine, showed them Jason's lab and answered all of the Spadafora's questions. "We weren't super comfortable with the idea of the CBD oil but we had just gone through a really rough summer where our daughter was having some of her worst episodes yet. We had gotten to the point where we willing to try anything," explains Jon.  

[quote]But there was one small hitch. "They were out of medicine. They were still getting started so we left the house that day with no medicine," recalls Sandi, who felt utterly defeated.[/quote]
 
"As you can imagine, it was a very emotional drive home. Sandi was so upset and during that drive we decided to go ahead and rent a home and move to Colorado. We didn't feel we had a choice," explains Jon of listing their Las Vegas home of the last seven years, which they had never expected to leave, and packing up their family and uprooting them. "Three weeks later we pulled into Colorado -- full of hope but not expecting a change as nothing had really worked for us yet." And then their luck changed.

Although they were inundated with requests for Haleigh's Hope, the Flowering H.O.P.E. Foundation eventually had Avery's medicine ready for her. And true to its name, the CBD oil called Haleigh's Hope brought the Spadafora's some.

"With butterflies in our stomachs, we gave her the first dose," Jon explains of the CBD oil he and Sandi put under Avery's tongue for the first time. "That night she had a seizure but it seemed to be less intense than they had been. We continued to give her the medicine and we were shocked when all of a sudden she went 18 nights without a seizure. We hadn't had 18 nights of sleep in a row since she had that first seizure, five years ago."

"She's a different kid on this medicine," interjects Sandi. "Before she slept till noon every day even though she went to bed at 8 p.m. Now she's up at 7:45 a.m. every day and doesn't take naps."

Jon finishes, "She has occasional episodes, but never with the frequency or intensity that she used to. In fact, it is now more common to have her go all night without an issue than it is to have a night with seizures. More importantly, we are watching her personality develop and watching milestones come back to her."

To this day, Avery does not have a technical diagnosis. And, if he had it to do over again, Jon would have handled pursuing Avery's diagnosis differently. "In retrospect I would have abandoned trying to find out what the issue was and just treated the symptoms. We would have concentrated on finding out a way to make the seizures stop rather than get a diagnosis."

As for Sandi, she is more pro-marijuana. "I would have moved here (to Colorado) five years ago," she relays with a laugh. "I started trying to get here about five months before we made it happen. For those six months of her having horrific seizures…if we could have known the answer was in Colorado we would have been here." 

As for parents who are on the fence and can't decide if CBD oil is the way to go, Sandi is adamant. "Oh, try it, absolutely," Sandi enthusiastically urges. "I thought back to all of these drugs that they were trying with her and as far as the list of side effects, some were horrible, and I thought how could taking medicinal cannabis be any worse than some of the things we have given her before." 

Jon agrees. "I think that's why we were so comfortable with doing it (trying Haleigh's Hope) because the doctors couldn't even tell us what her diagnosis was so why shouldn't we give it a try?"

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Marijuana advocacy in Nevada has a friend in State Senator <a href="http://www.tick4nevada.com/" title="Tick Segerblom" target="_blank">Richard S. "Tick" Segerblom</a>. A fourth-generation representative in Nevada, he currently represents <a href="http://www.clarkcountynv.gov/Depts/election/Pages/Senate.aspx" title="State Senate, Disctrict 3" target="_blank">Senate District 3</a>. Most recently, the former attorney made news with Senate Bill 372, legislation the media touted as a "pot for pets" bill. But there is far more to said bill, as there is to Sen. Segerblom himself, as well as the future of marijuana in the Silver State. 

The journey towards an interest in marijuana prohibition began for Segerblom back in the 1960s. "I remember how free love and marijuana and everything—we thought those things were going to happen," Segerblom says. "And then Reagan got elected governor of California and everything just went backwards. Now, I think finally society is starting to realize they spent almost 60 years going in the wrong direction and it's time to go back." 

He adds that while no substance or drug is 100 percent safe, marijuana is the least harmful one there is, even less so than alcohol. [quote align="right"]"A lot of people enjoy [marijuana], it has health benefits and to criminalize it and prosecute people—particularly people of color—is wrong. If we can rectify that, then I'm a happy camper."[/quote]

Segerblom believes the "War on Drugs" has failed. "We lost and we might as well deal with it and decriminalize most drugs, legalize a lot of them and then deal with the consequences," he says. "We have rehabilitation available. Tax the drugs, tax the alcohol, than provide rehabilitation services to people who can't handle it. But get away from putting people in jail who sold it, they used it, they had trouble because of their addiction. It destroyed a whole generation of people for no good reason. These are mental health issues, not criminal issues."

Looking at the state of marijuana in Nevada, it was unfortunate that <a href="https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/78th2015/Bills/SB/SB372.pdf" title="SENATE BILL NO. 372" target="_blank">Senate Bill 372</a> died in committee earlier this year. Key components tied into the bill (in addition to medical cannabis for ailing pets) were needed, including transfer of ownership. "It involves a five-mile rule where dispensaries can move within five miles," Segerblom says. "It also involves keeping home grown alive for another two years, keeping reciprocity provisions for another couple of years, there's a lot of little technical things." 

[caption id="attachment_141" align="alignleft" width="614"]<img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Elevate-June_July-Issue_no-bleed_Page_09_Image_0001.jpg" alt="Elevate June_July Issue_no bleed_Page_09_Image_0001" width="2513" height="1704" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1256" />Nevada Senator Tick Segerblom[/caption]

With regard to transferability of the medical marijuana license, Segerblom believes he will be able to address that issue. "We're working on an amendment to one of the existing bills that deals with medical marijuana and I'm optimistic that will be approved."

Senate Bill 372 also brought up the issue of "seed to sale" software solutions. This places a restriction on dispensaries in Clark County where they're only permitted to purchase medical marijuana from cultivation and processing facilities also within Clark County, which could potentially drive up the cost to patients. "I have lots of concerns about the cost and that's why we have Bill 276, which hopefully brings more dispensaries to Nevada," says Segerblom. "But as far as the technical issue where Clark County said you can't purchase marijuana from outside of Clark County to sell in Clark County, I'm not sure if we're able to address that issue. I think it's actually unconstitutional." He adds that unfortunately with all the given issues that need to be addressed, it's not a top priority. 

[accordion title='Continue Reading' open='false']
Another issue of concern to patients is the possibly of being charged with a DUI if they've medicated that day or even a few days prior. Segerblom says he feels bad about that, but currently they won't be able to address it. "The Democrats lost control of the legislature and a lot of those issues went up in smoke, so to speak."

In regards to education and training programs, Segerblom feels the responsibility lies on the dispensaries themselves, not a requirement by the government. "I think most dispensaries will have their own training programs as far as teaching budtenders to tell customers what the products do," Segerblom says. "I'm not sure those employees need to be trained by the state."

One question many patients have is that if reasonable accommodations are being made for medical marijuana patients, for instance being allowed to use a CBD-only medication at work. "It's a question that a lot of employers feel they have to do that already," Segerblom says. "Again, that's just a gray area which we hope to make black and white."

On a more positive front, Segerblom currently has a related bill that would legalize the growing of hemp. <a href="http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/78th2015/Bills/SB/SB305.pdf" title="SENATE BILL NO. 305–" target="_blank">SB305</a>, which Segerblom sponsored, initially was written to create regulations for an industrial hemp industry in the state. However, after many amendments inserted by both Assembly and Senate committees over the last several weeks, the bill has been limited to authorizing an institution of higher education or the State Department of Agriculture to grow or cultivate industrial hemp for purposes of research.

[caption id="attachment_141" align="alignright" width="614"]<img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Elevate-June_July-Issue_no-bleed_Page_10_Image_0001.jpg" alt="Elevate June_July Issue_no bleed_Page_10_Image_0001" width="1513" height="928" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1257" />Segerblom currently has a related bill that would legalize the growing of hemp[/caption]

More positive strides forward include Segerblom's recent trip to Colorado to investigate the marijuana business in that state. "It's a very successful business," he says of recreational marijuana industry in Colorado. "It's coming to Nevada, so get ready." 

In fact, recreational marijuana will appear on the Nevada ballot in 2016. "It's guaranteed. We got the 100 and some thousand signatures to get it on the ballot, the legislature did not act within 40 days, so it's going to be there," Segerblom says. "I think it's going to increase the turnouts. The people that show up to vote for marijuana will probably vote for the Democratic candidate for president." He adds, "No one can stop it at this point."

Well, almost no one. In the event a Republican president takes office, there are concerns of progress reversal. "Well, if it was up to the Republicans, they would do it and roll back the clock," Segerblom says. 

But the reality is the cat is out of the bag. "I don't see how they're going to put it back. This thing has gone so far and become so popular—especially once it starts to raise money and put taxes in the state coffers, to take that away I think would be very difficult. I do think there's some presidential candidates that are much more positive for the growth of marijuana and bylaws."

Involvement and showing up at the polls next November is key for supporters of medical marijuana, and now recreational marijuana. "If we can pass recreational, that will really change Nevada, in my opinion," Segerblom says. "It's perfect for our current industry. It will also get away from this idea the police are out there to put everybody in jail and this vicious cycle where cops bust you, your house, sell the house, use the money for SWAT armor to go bust another house. 

"We just need to move forward and recognize this drug is better than alcohol as far as drugs go and deal with the fallout, but don't put people in jail or pay cops to bust people because they're using marijuana."

		<title>Sting Alarm: Safeguarding the medicinal marijuana industry</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With <a href="http://www.stingsystems.com.">Sting Alarm's</a> extensive expertise in the world of casino security systems, it isn't much of a stretch that the Las Vegas-based security company would possess the necessary qualifications to service Nevada's various medical marijuana establishments as they prepare to open their doors over the next several months.

Similar to gaming, the medicinal cannabis industry will be heavily regulated. "Much like gaming regulations, the state of Nevada requires that security systems are installed by a licensed security company like Sting," explained Gabe Sbarglia, a systems engineer at Sting Alarm who has diligently followed the cannabis industry for the last year-and-a-half. "We have studied the law and are fully versed in state, city and county regulations -- making sure that our clients not only meet those regulations, but, at times, exceed them."

[quote]Under Nevada state law, NRS 453, medicinal marijuana establishments (MMEs) are required to utilize strict security measures in order to safeguard their facilities.[/quote] "They are expected to track their products from seed to sale, and our systems are meant to aid in that process," explained Mark Weldon, another of Sting's experts in the field of MME security who, like Sbarglia, is familiar with the regulations set forth by the city of Las Vegas, North Las Vegas, Clark County, Nye County, the city of Mesquite and beyond.

In order for MMEs to safeguard their product properly, Sting has implemented the following in all of the MMEs they have designed and installed security systems for over the last several months. "We've been implementing <a href="http://www.stingalarm.com/sting-alarm-surveillance-systems.html">network based high-definition cameras</a>, electronic access control which gives the client the ability to track who is entering controlled areas, and <a href="http://www.stingalarm.com/sting-alarm-business-security.html">burglar alarms</a> with our video verification feature," said Sbarglia. "Beyond those which meet state regulations, we also recommend video analytics which allows us to install a camera that can detect movement and generate an alert even when a guard may not be looking at that particular screen."

"We are strongly recommending MMEs install video verification systems because it allows us to tie the camera system to the alarm system and when the alarm goes off we can see the facility immediately and dispatch local authorities right away. The goal is to provide them with an accurate description of what is going on," further explained Weldon.

Other recommendations Weldon and Sbarglia suggest MMEs consider are outfitting transportation vehicles with surveillance for when they are moving product and the utilization of auditing tools for their facility so they can zero in on missing product.

"Our methods are very stringent because we want to prevent diversion of product to people who shouldn't have it like kids, criminals, and unlicensed patients," concluded Weldon. "Safeguarding product is critical to these establishments and we are here to help prevent product from actually hitting the streets and getting in the wrong hands."

Serving business, residential and commercial customers since 2003, <a href="http://www.stingalarm.com.">Sting Alarm</a> has an A+ rating with the Southern Nevada Better Business Bureau. To find out more, call <a href="tel:86684STING">866.84.STING</a> or visit <a href="http://www.stingsystems.com.">www.stingsystems.com</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Ace Analytical Laboratory founders on the forefront of safe cannabis care</strong>

[quote align="right"]Leading Ace Analytical Laboratory are from left: Lizette Matos, Manager; Traci Carranza, Scientifi c Director; and Kris Madsen, Co-founder and Manager.[/quote]

Ace Analytical Laboratory co-founders Kris Madsen and Bruce Burnett are not your typical laboratory owners. In fact, it wasn't even their idea to get in the business of testing medicinal cannabis. 

Although Madsen is a self-described serial entrepreneur, it was a business associate who suggested she pursue obtaining a laboratory license through the state of Nevada last year. "I was in the market to buy another business and I went to a friend to review P&Ls to get his opinion on potential businesses. As we were discussing the prospects, he asked why I wasn't getting in the medicinal marijuana testing business." 

The idea clicked instantly. Madsen approached her husband Dr. Bruce Burnett, an anesthesiologist, and the rest is history. "We have been working on this since last May and it's been like drinking from a fire hose since. We have been diligent in reviewing the entire cannabis movement, and are enthusiastically pursuing the dream of opening our lab," said Madsen who secured a provisional state license last November, has been taking delivery of lab equipment, and anticipates receiving final state approval to begin operations during the beginning of the third quarter of 2015.

Madsen's associate was right, she and Burnett are obvious choices for the medicinal cannabis industry. The duo not only knows how to get things done quickly, but as Madsen explains, "Bruce has extensive experience in dealing with and understanding the incredible benefits the proper drugs can bring to patients in need. He understands how the right drugs can benefit patients with certain disorders, and is very comfortable in the lab environment and understands the testing methodology."

There's certainly no question about Burnett's medical knowledge when he speaks about cannabis' future as a medicinal/pharmacological compound. "We are at the very early stages of understanding the complex human endocannabinoid system and the many specific conditions for which we may be able to develop clinically relevant treatments utilizing compounds derived from cannabis," explains Burnett. "The scientific and medical understanding of cannabis and its myriad interactions with human diseases and conditions is set to explode over the near term. I thoroughly believe that it will be one of the more exciting areas for research in medicine over the next several decades."

While Burnett is excited about cannabis' medical ramifications, Madsen is fervent about Ace Analytical Laboratory's, www.aalabnv.com, future in the industry. "We are passionate about healthcare and want to make sure what gets introduced into the Las Vegas community is safe, efficacious and used properly," says Madsen. "We also know that we can be on the forefront of ‘how good it can get' for people who are suffering from a wide range of diseases and conditions."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>The Grove builds team with commitment to providing most effective medicinal cannabis possible</strong>

"Medicine the way nature intended." That's the short answer to how Demetri Kouretas, CEO of The Grove, www.thegrovenv.com, describes the products being carried at the two dispensaries he and his team will be opening in Las Vegas (4647 Paradise Road) and Pahrump (1541 E. Basin Avenue) in early fall. 

The long answer? "The mission of The Grove is to provide high-quality and organically grown medical marijuana products to qualified patients in a compassionate and ethical manner," further explains Kouretas. "We will listen to our patients' needs and adjust our inventory based on their requests so we can continue to help treat their conditions."
So committed to its patients, The Grove has hired a general manager to run both dispensaries who is a registered nurse and very knowledgeable of the different strains and ailments they treat. In addition, the majority of The Grove's employees will have medical backgrounds to better assist patients. "It's imperative that we help our patients learn how to medicate properly," says Kouretas. 

The Grove will offer a full range of products, all produced according to strict standards for organic growing and processing, including a variety of flower (buds), joints (pre-rolled), blunts (all natural), topicals, CBD varieties, tinctures, hash, oil concentrates, drinks, sub-linguals, pills, extracts, and possibly seeds and/or clones.

"The medicines we plan to offer will be based on what local cultivators have that is aligned with our patients' needs," explains Kouretas of the wide selection of strains the dispensaries will carry when they open, which includes: OG, Bubba Kush, Blackberry Kush, Strawberry Chemdog, Pineapple Cheese, Gorilla Glue, The Sauce, Grand Daddy Purple and Velvet Elvis.

The Grove's own operational grow and production facility will be up and running in early 2016. "With the help of our experienced master grower and his team of experts, we will carefully cultivate hybrid strains that grow the most effective medicinal marijuana," Kouretas proudly notes of the experts he has assembled, continuing, "we have built a team of people who embody both experience in a variety of medical backgrounds and a heartfelt commitment to improving the lives of those who can benefit from medical marijuana." ]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Envisioning Nevada as a leader in the medical marijuana industry through research, innovation and proper regulation, the Las Vegas Medical Marijuana Association (LVMMA) was established one year ago in an effort to organize, promote and support Southern Nevada's medical marijuana industry. 

Founded by John Laub - president, James Lamb - vice president and Tom Haynie, LVMMA was formed to be a chamber of commerce type of organization for the Las Vegas medical marijuana industry. Although still in its infancy, the organization has held over 20 meetings and events, covering everything from education, regulation, and new innovations to networking, packaging, security and safety. 

[caption id="attachment_141" align="alignleft" width="614"]<img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Elevate-June_July-Issue_no-bleed_Page_31_Image_0003.jpg" alt="Elevate June_July Issue_no bleed_Page_31_Image_0003" width="642" height="642" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1289" />LVMMA President John Laub[/caption]

LVMMA's membership is made up of dispensary owners, production facilities, cultivators, labs and various companies that work with the industry. The organization also has members who are patients, doctors, nurses and researchers. 

"We are an inclusive group that includes members who are supporters of medical marijuana," John Laub explains of LVMMA's open invitation to anyone interested in attending meetings. "We believe that we need to include as many people as possible for the health aspects as well as the economic opportunities it will create in Southern Nevada."
 
With regard to economic opportunities, the organization's founders believe the industry will initially create 3,000 jobs in Nevada and as demand grows, they estimate close to 10,000 people will be working in the medical marijuana industry.

As for medicinal marijuana's beneficial health aspects, Laub believes that in time the Silver State will become a premiere destination for medical marijuana tourism -- predicting that families and patients will come to Nevada for the latest treatments and advancements in medical marijuana to treat everything from autism, PTSD and Parkinson's, to migraines, cancer, epilepsy and other maladies.

"Patients will come to Nevada to see if certain strains and cannabinoids can treat Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, seizure disorders in children, ADD & ADHD and reduce the plaque in brains that leads to Alzheimer's disease," says Laub.

"Nevada has always been open to new ideas and we don't see that being any different with regard to the medicinal marijuana industry," concludes Laub.

		<title>Canalysis Laboratories to open this summer</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA["Lab testing is the bedrock of the industry," noted Heath Timmons, a chemist at Canalysis Laboratories, www.canalysislaboratories.com. "Labs are going to be the gatekeepers of quality for cannabis commerce." 

And that's the very reason why Timmons and his fellow chemist Corey Terry will be instrumental to the success of Canalysis Laboratories, which will begin testing medicinal marijuana products later this summer in Southern Nevada.

"The unique and distinguishing factor about Canalysis is the experience of the staff and that we come from a rigid, data quality background that's been applied and proven in environmental safety analysis and pharmaceutical quality testing. We will be bringing these practices to the cannabis industry in Nevada," explained Terry, who has Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from Metropolitan State University in Colorado.

Timmons agreed, adding, "Combining our backgrounds sets us apart from other scientists in the industry. The data quality control [Corey] brings is unparalleled.

[quote]"It allows us to see everything with the highest sensitivity possible. We will be able to detect organic residues and toxins at the parts per trillion level," Timmons explained in awe. "It allows us to detect multiple contaminants with one instrument and one run -- giving us the best method possible."[/quote]

"My background is with extraction, purification, and identification of bioactive natural compounds, and I now bring that expertise to certifying cannabis as safe for the patients of Nevada," finished Timmons, who graduated with a Master of Science in Organic Chemistry from the University of Illinois.

Helping Timmons and Terry to perform the exemplary work they speak of at Canalysis's 10,000-square-foot laboratory will be a slew of state-of-the-art instruments. The duo is particularly enamored of a recently acquired liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer.

"That's some serious firepower," added Terry of the spectrometer, noting it will be instrumental to the three- to five-day testing turnaround Canalysis customers can expect. 

Terry and Timmons are also excited about Nevada's role in setting the standard for lab testing. "No market has been given this opportunity but in Nevada we are getting to do real science," said Timmons. "It's a unique opportunity for us to set a standard that will be adopted across the United States."

"We are a national lab using Nevada to set up the lab testing model and then we will roll it out into other states that have legalized medicinal marijuana," added Tyree Brown, Canalysis CEO. 

But to Canalysis's chemists it is much more than having a national footprint. "Canalysis is definitely concerned with patient health and Nevada's health as a whole," explained Terry. "Our motivation is about people and taking care of people, first and foremost."]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Evergreen Organix to carry exclusive medicinal marijuana strains</title>
		<link>https://elevatenv.com/cultivator-to-release-29-strains-by-years-end/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The creator of such well-known marijuana strains as Orange Crush and Godzilla has been tapped as the chief cultivator for Evergreen Organix Cultivation and Production, <a href="http://www.evergreenorganix.com" title="Evergreen Organix">www.evergreenorganix.com</a>. Under the direction of cultivator Kurt Barrick, CEO of The VonDank Group, Evergreen Organix will be releasing 29 strains when it opens later this year.

"We will be doing some exclusive strains being bred just for them," explains Barrick of the medicine Evergreen Organix plans to offer its patients. "There will also be some older popular ones and some of the current ones, too. There will also be some CBDs like ACDC, Harlequins, with low, low limits of THC. 

"Looking at what the patients want is what Evergreen is going to carry. We are taking from our experience of what has sold very well in the past and that is what we will bring in. We are also looking at our genetic library," said Barrick, who has created 16 of his own strains throughout his career as a cultivator. "We will bring those into the rotation so we have those too. We are going to be working some very good genetics to create some exclusive strains that will have a demand."

In addition to cultivating exclusive strains for Evergreen, Barrick has also been instrumental in collaborating on the facility's grow philosophy. "For Evergreen, specifically, it's about setting a quality of standards, consistency and cleanliness. They want to produce the cleanest possible medicine that they can," said Barrick who has been in the marijuana business for 30 years. "It's really an oversized laboratory. It's medicine so we want to treat it as medicine. We have taken this to indoor growing so we can control the environment and control the quality of that plant." 

Growing marijuana has become very high-tech since Barrick started in 1986 with only a small pack of seeds. "At that point there wasn't really any technology or method out there so it was all trial and error. There wasn't a huge genetic pool of selection."

Times have changed. Evergreen Organix's cultivation area is approximately 30,000 square feet in which the facility plans to grow hydroponic organic products as well as house a production kitchen. "Evergreen will have a flexible extraction process so they are going to be flexible in what products they bring to the market," revealed Barrick who has grown marijuana in Colorado, Arizona, California and patient-only in Nevada. 

"It's a patient-driven product so it's in everybody's best interest to produce the safest, best product possible," explained Barrick. "Evergreen will do that and more because they will be able to meet the demands and needs of the patients."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A parent who has a child suffering from seizures or an adult child caring for a terminally ill parent may look to medical marijuana as a treatment option when traditional options have failed. Nevada's medical marijuana laws specifically address an individual acting as a caregiver and has created duties and requirements for the designated caregiver defining them as:

A caregiver is an individual over the age of 18 with significant responsibility for managing the well-being of an individual who is a medical marijuana patient and who has been designated and approved as that patient's caregiver.

[quote]If a patient needs or wants a caregiver, the patient must designate a specific individual as his or her caregiver by submitting forms to the <a href="http://health.nv.gov/MedicalMarijuana_Cardholder.htm">Nevada Division of Health and Human Services</a>.[/quote]

It is important to note that a patient under the age of 18 can only receive a medical marijuana patient card if the parent or legal guardian agrees to be the designated caregiver. A patient can only designate one caregiver and that

caregiver must be a resident of Nevada, approved by a physician, consent to being the caregiver and pass a background check. A caregiver is given the same protections from state prosecution as a patient once the caregiver obtains a registration card. However, just like a patient, the caregiver must act within the law, which includes being able to:

<ul>
<li>purchase up to 2.5 ounces of usable marijuana every 14 days for the patient</li>
<li>purchase from the patient's designated dispensary (once dispensaries open)</li>
<li>grow up to 12 plants until a dispensary opens in the county</li>
</ul>

Also, the caregiver is responsible for managing the well-being of the patient including purchasing the medical marijuana and overseeing the dosage and frequency of use.

Please remember marijuana remains illegal under federal law, therefore, being a caregiver carries a certain amount of risk. A caregiver should contact an attorney to get a better understanding of the law and the risks when considering becoming a caregiver.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It would seem Jason Cranford, creator of Haleigh's Hope, has been on a trajectory toward healing others through the use of medicinal marijuana for as long as he can remember. "I've worked around plants my whole life," said Cranford. "I interned at University of Georgia greenhouses in Athens, Georgia while I was in college and moved to Humboldt County in California about seven years ago and cultivated for collectives in the Bay Area."

It was during Cranford's stint in Humboldt County, well-known for its cultivation and proliferation of marijuana, that he discovered the work of Israeli organic chemist Raphael Mechoulam, a professor of Medicinal Chemistry at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, best known for his work isolating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahydrocannabinol" title="Tetrahydrocannabinol" target="_blank">tetrahydrocannabinol</a>.

That was in 2008 and the work of Mechoulam sent Cranford immediately on a strain hunt for a high <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabidiol" title="CBD's" target="_blank">CBD</a> genetic. "I collected and tested hundreds of plants in Northern California and Colorado until I found two high CBD strains in 2009. I have been creating products and breeding them ever since," recollected Cranford, who is now based in Longmont, Colorado. 

Cranford was most interested in what he could develop to help people with MS, epilepsy and cancer. "In 2010 I started giving the low THC oil to children.[caption id="attachment_141" align="alignright" width="614"]<img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/haleighs-hop3-ribbon1.png" alt="IMG_5388" width="2448" height="3264" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1107" />Haleigh's Hope[/caption]Two years ago I started seeing an increase in patients after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJafxCqrfSo" title="CNN - WEED 1 - A Dr Sanjay Gupta Documentary" target="_blank">CNN's "Weed 1" documentary</a> aired. My tests results were posted publicly on a lab website so people started finding me."

Exactly how CBD oil works to eliminate seizures is complicated, but Cranford succinctly summarized it as: "Cannabinoids are a neuro-protectant, meaning the compounds protect your neurons which control motor skills and the electrical current that runs through your brain called synapsis. I believe the Cannabinoids regulate the electrical waves that are measured in Hz. At the same time they are protecting the neurons from being damaged by the spike in brainwaves that happen during a seizure."

Cranford's Flowering H.O.P.E. Foundation now treats approximately 200 patients using Haleigh's Hope, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.floweringhope.co" title="Flowering Hope">www.floweringhope.co</a>. Although Haleigh's Hope won't be available in Nevada, Cranford is open to partnerships or licensing agreements but has not found a dispensary to partner with yet.

As Cranford continues on his trajectory toward helping others (he's currently working on a CBD oil for Crohn's disease) he does not describe himself as a scientist or a botanist but "a simple person who stumbled on a miracle and now I'm just trying to do the right thing with it."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>How would a parent know if medicinal cannabis is the right way to go if their child is suffering from epilepsy?</strong>
I will start out by saying the use of medical cannabis in children is very controversial. There are no published studies on the use of medical cannabis/cannabinoids in the pediatric population. Thus, there is no efficacy, safety, or tolerability data available.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently reaffirmed its opposition of the use of medical cannabis in the range of 0-21 year olds, citing negative health and brain development effects in this age group. Furthermore, AAP opposes medical cannabis use outside of the FDA regulatory process. However, AAP also recognizes medical cannabis/cannabinoids may be an option for children with severely debilitating conditions for whom current therapies are insufficient. Finally, AAP "strongly supports" research and development of pharmaceutical cannabinoids, reclassifying medical cannabis as a Schedule II drug in order to facilitate research, and decriminalization of marijuana use.

So, going back to the question, parents should start to seek alternative therapies once traditional interventions have failed and/or have caused significant side effects. But all decisions should be made under the advice and supervision of a physician.  


<strong>What's the first step for parents to begin navigating the medicinal cannabis road?</strong>
Parents need to consult their pediatrician and do some research. Several large epilepsy centers will be participating in a study to test the efficacy of GW Pharmaceuticals' Epidiolex, which is a liquid form of CBD, www.gwpharm.com/Epidiolex.
</blockquote>

<strong>How does medicinal cannabis work for patients who are suffering from epilepsy? </strong>
The exact mechanism of action is unknown but several hypotheses include:
<ul>
<li>Modulation of neurotransmission</li>
<li>Decrease neuro-inflammation</li>
<li>Modulation of oxidative stress</li>
<li>Multifactorial in modulation of number of endogenous systems in order to attenuate and or possibly prevent hyper-excitability of neurons, which may be influenced through ion channel control, endocannabinoid system, and inflammatory processes</li>
<li>Of note, CBD has very minimal binding at the Cannabinoid Receptor 1 (CB1), which is a binding site for THC</li>
</ul>

[one_half]
<strong>How are the CBD oils administered?</strong>
Oral administration is probably the simplest route. Administration of the medication has been via slow titration to desired effect. Again, there is no efficacy, safety or tolerability data to help guide caregivers and physicians. The majority administer the oral medication anywhere from one to four times per day.

<strong>How do you determine who should be using cannabis oil?</strong>
Most parents have chosen medical cannabis for their child whom is refractory to the standard treatment with Antiepileptic Drugs (AED), or the side effects from these medications have become intolerable to the child. Intractable epilepsy can lead to frequent seizures, neurodevelopmental delays, impaired quality of life, severe side effects from AEDs, and possibly death. Treatment with medical cannabis is usually the last option parents turn to for reprieve from the medically resistant seizures.

<strong>How can parents determine if the medicine they are getting is legitimate and safe?</strong>
This is such an important point and very difficult to verify. A recent study from Colorado revealed a significant variation in the concentration of THC, presence of contaminants, and inconsistencies in the reported CBD/THC ratios. Colorado will now require independent testing.

Nevada already has statutes in place for independent laboratory testing to confirm what the cultivation and production facilities place on their labels. Therefore, once the dispensaries open, the patients can be confident that what they purchase will contain the percentages written on the label.

<strong>What should parents ask a physician/caregiver to make sure he/she qualified to treat their child with medicinal cannabis?</strong>
Experience is important; however, this quality might be difficult to find because there will not be many experts in this burgeoning field.  

<strong>The FDA has given GW Pharmaceuticals orphan drug status for Epidiolex which is described as an oral liquid formulation of a highly purified extract of CBD. How far are we from seeing Epidiolex becoming an over-the-counter drug?</strong>
Manufacturers are afforded 20 years of patent protection from the date of filing. GW Pharmaceuticals is going through the FDA process. Thus, once they get FDA approval for Epidiolex, it will be a covered medication through the insurance companies. This is much different than obtaining a similar high-CBD oil from a dispensary, which will be cash based.
[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<strong>And if Epidiolex is as effective as the studies show, will it become the go-to drug that physicians will prescribe over traditional epilepsy medicines now in use? </strong>
The jury is still out on this. Epidiolex will have to go through the Phase III and Phase IV clinical trials in order to assess efficacy, safety, therapeutic effect, and long-term effects.  

<strong>The most well-known medicinal cannabis treatment for epilepsy is Charlotte's Web made by the Stanley Brothers in Colorado, which was made famous by the 2013 CNN documentary "Weed." If a Nevadan has a medicinal marijuana card, can they get legal access to Charlotte's Web? </strong>
The cultivation of medical cannabis has become very scientific. The different genetics produced are becoming very specialized. There will most likely be many different strains that will contain very high CBD/THC ratio, which will potentially have anti-epileptic properties.   

<em>Editor's note: CWNevada is the Stanley Brothers' Nevada partner and has exclusive rights to Charlotte's Web here in the state.<em>

<strong>Are there any cons to giving a child medicinal cannabis?</strong>
There are several potential negative effects of cannabis that one needs to be aware of. These effects have been observed in adolescents and include:
<ul>
<li>Impaired short-term memory;</li>
<li>Decreased concentration, decreased attention span, difficulty problem solving;</li>
<li>Adolescent brain, specifically the pre-frontal cortex, which controls judgment and decision-making, are not fully developed until early to mid-20s. Thus, substance use may affect the developing brain.</li>
</ul>
One thing to keep in mind is that these children are being administered medical cannabis because they have intractable epilepsy which leads to frequent seizures, neurodevelopmental delays, impaired quality of life, severe side effects from antiepileptic drugs, and possibly death.  

<strong>Has the success of CBD oil started to change the way the medical community views the treatment of epilepsy? </strong>
In general physicians are very conservative. Any change in how medicine is practiced is thoroughly scrutinized.  Physicians look for studies to confirm the outcomes. Most physicians and most medical societies favor changing the classification of medical cannabis from a Schedule I drug to a Schedule II in order to facilitate research. Going back to your question, there is no doubt in my mind that physicians are looking at the potential positive effects of medical cannabis after the investigative reporting of Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent.

WASHOE COUNTY, Nev. (MyNews4.com & KRNV) --Plans to build a medical marijuana dispensary off the Mount Rose Highway is raising opposition.

Now, one of the owners and investors of the proposed dispensary is speaking out.

Hugh Hempel says he plans to attend a meeting set from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. Wednesday, June 10 at Galena High School to answer questions and address concerns. 

Washoe County Commissioner Bob Lucey said his phone has been ringing off the hook.

He said, "I have had hundreds of calls from upset citizens in regards to the location of the dispensary. They are not opposed to medical marijuana, they're just upset about the location."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nevada’s first dispensary has opened. Silver State Relief in Sparks, Nevada can claim the distinction of opening the state’s first medicinal marijuana dispensary.  

It took 15 years but Nevada finally got it done after voters first made medicinal cannabis legal in 2000 and state legislators set up the state’s framework for regulation and taxation in 2013. 

Because Nevada’s Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Agriculture are still working on pesticide regulations and lab testing requirements for growing marijuana, dispensaries have had to get creative when it comes to sourcing their plants.

And since medical marijuana is not federally approved, businesses can't ship in plants from other states so Silver State Relief obtained plants from legal cardholders around the state who are allowed to own no more than 12 plants each for personal use. 

According to the Reno Gazette Journal, Silver State Relief now possesses around 200 plants, brought in from all around Nevada, which they will use to grow future crops. Now that they have purchased the plants, they are not limited by how many they can grow in the future. 

The Reno Gazette Journal also reported that because plants can take months to yield a crop, Silver State Relief's initial offerings will be modest, with around 12-14 pounds of marijuana available on opening day. Patients are allowed to possess 2.5 ounces of marijuana per 14-day period, but given that the store will have a slim supply, the dispensary is limiting purchases to a half-ounce per transaction.

According to a Las Vegas Review-Journal article, Silver State Relief is selling about six strains of marijuana that have names such as Girl Scout Cookie, Skunk One, Ghost OG and Purple Kush. Because of the limited supply, no edible products are yet being offered, and patients are limited to buying one-half ounce, which sells for $195. 

There are 10,027 people with medical marijuana cards in Nevada, with most, 6,696, living in Clark County.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>[dropcap]A[/dropcap]s Nevada diligently prepares for the launch of a new industry, many comparisons have been drawn between medical marijuana and gaming. From licensing and regulation to economic issues and stigmas, the two have a lot in common. But, most importantly, were it not for gaming, the state’s newest industry would probably be struggling instead of preparing to open its doors.</strong>

[quote]Nevada welcomes a new industry using the experience of the state's most vaunted and regulated.[/quote]

“Because of the state’s background in gaming, the rollout of medicinal marijuana has gone a lot smoother than in other states,” sums up Frank Tutera, managing member of G3 Labs and former Sr. VP of Casino Marketing at a number of casinos, of how gaming has paved the way for medicinal cannabis. 

“No one has required testing to the extent Nevada has and I think that all has to do with Nevada’s great experience with gaming. It may look slow but it hasn’t been, and it’s been very orderly,” says Tutera. “In California they don’t have any state regulation; they operate by a city and county basis. Oregon has both medical and recreational, and doesn’t have required testing. Testing in Colorado has only been recently required and it will start in the fall.”

Leslie Bocskor, founding chairman of the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association, has also found that having a vaunted gaming industry with a system of processes and controls in place has been a benefit to the establishment of Nevada’s medicinal marijuana industry. “Our system has had the fewest bumps in the road, comparatively, and is the most comprehensive so far. It’s because Nevada has been working at developing this privileged licensing process for decades and is far ahead of any jurisdiction in the world, whether it’s gaming, escorts services, boxing or MMA. We have been doing this for decades when nobody else was willing to.”

<h2>License to Thrive</h2>

Licensing of the two industries has many similarities because the state has piggybacked onto what gaming has already implemented. “The gaming and medicinal marijuana applications are almost twins. They are very, very similar,” says Tutera. “Pretty much everything they have done with medicinal marijuana tracks what has been done in gaming.

“In both instances, people are applying for a privileged license. Meaning the licensing author can choose to give it to you or not to give it to you. It’s considered a privilege and if you don’t follow the laws, rules and regulations, that license can be revoked at any time with due process.”

Nevada State Senator Tick Segerblom agrees on the similarities between the two industries but feels the gaming license is a tougher prospect. “They probably don’t do as extensive of a background check for the marijuana industry but the concept is the same. They want to see where the money came from, show who’s making the money, and make sure it’s not from the mafia and that there are not silent partners,” explains Segerblom. 

While it may not have been as stringent, it was still a significant endeavor to apply for a medicinal marijuana license, according to Bocskor. “It wasn’t easy. I know well-known people, well ensconced in business in Nevada for decades, who were turned away for getting DUIs 25 years ago. And the city of Las Vegas MMEs (medicinal marijuana establishments) applications were the most onerous in the country. The city announced in June and expected you to hand in your entire state application in July. 

“I am told, as well, that to apply with city of Las Vegas you needed to provide so much personal financial information that it came to nearly 30,000 pages of material. The city was not just asking for your personal financial information but also for that of your siblings, your spouse and your parents too.”

But still none of what medicinal marijuana licensees went through compares to getting an unlimited gaming license notes Bocskor, who says, “I am told that it is harder to get one of those than to become a secret service agent for the President of the United States.”

Attorney Jeff Silver of Dickinson Wright cites another difference between the two industries, noting the medical marijuana licenses were reviewed more or less in a secret format. “The applications were submitted anonymously to a group of reviewers that rated the applications. And that’s a much different circumstance than the gaming industry which does it out in the open, following open meeting laws.

<a href="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cover-Story-3.jpg"><img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cover-Story-3.jpg" alt="Cover Story 3" width="1140" height="883" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1641" /></a>

“Consequently their review of gaming applications can take eight or ten months unlike the medicinal marijuana licensees. The gaming application itself is just the tip of the iceberg, they travel around the country and perform a significant background check too,” says Silver. “When you give your application to the Gaming Commission, it’s a blank check to make sure they have the resources to investigate you thoroughly. For MMEs, there was a fee, and it was substantial, but it wasn’t a blank check like with gaming.”

<h2>Money Makes the World Go Round</h2>

All of those very in-depth and diligent background checks are for one reason. 

“The Gaming Control Board and Gaming Commission set up rules and regulations under which casinos have to operate and one of the things they are most interested in is following the money,” says Tutera. “In gaming it’s all about tracking the money. In the medical marijuana industry, it’s about tracking the product and maintaining the chain of custody. So everyone will have to maintain a strict chain of custody from seed to sale just like the casinos have to maintain a strict chain of custody over the money they take in and the money they take out. The methods are practically the same.” 

Which is why “I proposed the Gaming Control Board oversee the cannabis industry but they rejected it,” Segerblom says. 

But Segerblom hasn’t given up yet. “IP1, which hopefully will pass in 2016, would take governance away from the Department of Health and move it to the Department of Taxation which I think will be a good start. Ideally we should be moving it under the Gaming Control Board because they have a lot of the same functions, so why reinvent the wheel?”

<h2>Woe, The Economic Woes</h2>

In an attempt to lift the state out of the Great Depression, the Nevada State Legislature legalized gambling in 1931 because the state’s mines were in decline and its economy was in shambles. Legalizing medicinal marijuana, too, has come on the heels of a significant economic recession. 

“I think that the economic environment played into it to a certain extent,” concludes Bocskor of Nevada’s legalization of medicinal cannabis. “When you have jurisdictions facing bankruptcy and when you look at the situation that so many states are in, where they are facing so many shortfalls in revenue, it has given a lot of cover to politicians to evolve when they otherwise wouldn’t have.”

Segerblom agrees. “I am sure economics does play a role. I think particularly when a lot of people are philosophically opposed to it (medicinal marijuana), people see it as a way to make money and help the economy. If you look at Colorado, that is exactly what it has done for them and other states are seeing that.”

Even in recent times gaming faced the same issue. “The proliferation of gaming is largely and economically driven by the needs of a state’s funds,” says Silver of states that legalized gaming over the last few decades. “We have also seen medical marijuana being considered because it’s all about the revenue. The tighter the budget is in various states, the greater the interest in taxation and fundraising.”

Tutera sees it differently. “I don’t think the Depression had anything to do with gaming being legalized nor do I think in 2001, when they first legalized medicinal marijuana for personal use, did it have anything to do with economics. 


<a href="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cover-Story-2.jpg"><img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Cover-Story-2.jpg" alt="Cover Story 2" width="829" height="555" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1642" /></a>

“As far as the Great Depression, Nevada and Clark County decided you had all these workers building the Hoover Dam that needed something to do at night and casinos were the answer. It had everything to do with the workers at Hoover Dam and nothing to do with the economy.”

Speaking of workers, both Segerblom and Bocskor are optimistic about the uptick in employment that will follow the opening of MMEs. 

“It’s been estimated that 200,000 jobs will be created in the U.S. this year alone in the cannabis industry,” Bocskor relays.

Segerblom predicts, “We should have a much larger employee base than Colorado does. In Colorado there are 15,000 people with cards, who have registered to work just in the industry alone, and that’s not including auxiliary industries. Colorado has double the population of Nevada but we have 40 million tourists to cater to.”

<h2>The Enigma of the Stigma</h2>

There is something else Nevada has that Colorado doesn’t. “We are all about sensory perception,” Segerblom enthuses of the entertainment capital of the world. “We specialize in overloading your senses -- we have the best clubs, concerts, pools, food. This is just one more reason why it (marijuana) works in Las Vegas.

“That’s why from my perspective we need to jump on it and get in there quickly. We have a window here to still make it one of those things you can do here and not in your home state or country.

“We have always prided ourselves in Nevada of being able to step up to the plate to the next innovation and this is it. You always have to be on the cutting edge to attract people and make it exciting. It will take Las Vegas to the next level,” assures Segerblom. 

But there’s still the issue of the stigma to overcome. “That’s the biggest problem. I think the stigma could go away, but the first step is to take the drug off the Schedule 1 list because a large body of law enforcement is waiting to pounce,” says Silver. 

“The medical issue is one thing and I think Nevada has taken the right step in legalizing it but the question is whether or not recreational use will follow. And that’s the one with the potential to bring great scrutiny from the federal government. Most states have passed it for humanitarian reasons. If you listen to the comments made by the County Commissioners they, too, are skeptical about the medical applications,” theorizes Silver about marijuana’s stigma.  

On the other hand, Tutera sees the skepticism about medicinal marijuana diminishing -- and a lot quicker than it did for gaming. “Gaming, in some form or another, is now in 48 states and medical marijuana is in 23 states. Gaming started here in 1931 and it wasn’t until 1978 that gaming started in Atlantic City. And, yet, medical marijuana has certainly caught on much quicker than that,” he explains. 

Bocskor agrees that medicinal cannabis’ stigma is disappearing much faster than gaming’s. “Remember there’s no such thing as medical gaming -- were it not medicinal marijuana, and its ability to help those with medical needs, it probably wouldn’t have become legal in so many states so quickly. It will also transition as a combination of forces change it from a stigmatized industry to something that is better thought of because of its medicinal benefits.” 

Healing benefits, licensing and regulations aside, there’s no denying Las Vegas is a town celebrated for its vices and all-sensory offerings so it only makes sense Sin City would have the efficient wherewithal to embrace one more. ]]></content:encoded>

<p style="margin-top:20px;">Cannabis-infused chocolate chip cookies are one of the best edibles around. The easy way to medicate them is to use hash oil or honey oil. You melt it slowly into the butter/water (just like you do when making cannabis butter), let the butter melt for 20-30 minutes, pour into a container and refrigerate. Several hours later the butter is solidified and ready to be used. No need for straining. However, this recipe can also be made using the traditional cannabis butter recipe. Makes 4 dozen cookies (more if they are smaller).</p>

[one_half]
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
2 cups all-purpose flour
1/4 cup cannabis flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
4 - 6 grams hash oil or honey oil (BHO) to integrate into butter
1 cup medically-infused butter, softened
3/4 cup maple sugar*
1 cup packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 large eggs
1 cup white chocolate chips
1 cup milk chocolate chips
1 cup dark chocolate chips
1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>Method:</h3>
<p>Whisk together <strong>flour</strong>, <strong>baking soda</strong> and <strong>salt</strong> in small bowl. Set aside. In to the bowl of a standing mixer, add the <strong>medically-infused butter, maple sugar*, brown sugar</strong> and <strong>vanilla extract</strong> and beat until creamy. Add the <strong>eggs one at a time</strong> while still beating. Slowly add in <strong>flour</strong>. Now stir in <strong>chocolate chips</strong>. Drop by rounded tablespoon or small ice cream scooper onto ungreased baking sheets. Flatten slightly.</p>
<p><strong>Bake at 375°F for <em>9 to 11 minutes</em></strong> or until golden brown. Let sit on baking sheets for 10 minutes then move to wire rack to cool. Have one now and seal the rest in food bags and put into freezer for later.</p>
<p>*No maple sugar? Add 3 tsp. maple extract and add 3/4 cup granulated sugar.</p>
<p>Fall option: for Pumpkin Spice cookies add 3 tsp. pumpkin spice and 1 tsp. orange food coloring.</p>

[/one_half_last]

<em><strong>*Please remember</strong> that when cooking with medicinal cannabis you are cooking with a drug and the amounts of the drug and portions of the food ingested should always be taken into consideration. Always start out with small portions or doses and wait 30 minutes to an hour before eating any additional portions of food prepared with medical marijuana.</em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[While the process may be slower than expected, Nevada’s diligence in setting the gold standard for medical marijuana testing will pay off. Patients may not have previously given a second thought to—or had been aware of—the myriad of potential contaminants that could be present in their medication. But with a recent pesticide scare and dosing discrepancies in Colorado, the plan in Nevada is to get it right the first time without backpedaling after an incident. 

“I believe that both California and Colorado let the ‘pot industry’ get ahead of the ‘testing rules’ and have been playing catch-up ever since—to the detriment of the medical marijuana patients,” says Dr. Bruce Burnett, cofounder of Ace Analytical Laboratory. “The entire cannabis industry has learned from the Colorado debacle related to dosages and packaging earlier this year. Nevada, clearly, is the world’s leader in regulating the gaming industry and can likewise be recognized as setting the testing standards for the medical marijuana industry.”

Todd Denkin, CEO at DigiPath, points out that mandatory testing laws around the country outside of Nevada are quite lax. “My feeling is if we’re going to call this medicine, we have to treat it like medicine. So I’m very proud of what Nevada has put together. California is still the Wild West where testing is not even mandatory. It’s really done for a marketing purpose and most folks are just testing for THC content and nothing else.” He adds that Colorado only tested for potency until the pesticide scare forced them to change their approach. 

“I think one of the things the state has put a lot of emphasis on is patient safety,” says Isaac Maceo, lab manager at G3 Labs. “We’re dealing with a lot of contaminants that the state wants to keep out of the product.”

Though the definitive pesticide policy is being hatched as of press time, earlier this summer the state did release a list of 41 analytes with low levels of acceptability that are nearly zero, Denkin explains. Other examples of the myriad of testing that will be required in Nevada covers lead, arsenic, mercury, bacteria, fungus, mold, yeast, E. coli, salmonella and more.  

“We also want to make sure that if they do take this product, they’re not going to have any side effects or adverse reactions to the product because it’s been contaminated by the way that someone is growing the product,” says Maceo.

In addition to testing for harmful contaminants of medical marijuana, patients will also have the added benefit of efficacy testing. “We give a complete cannabinoid analysis as well as a terpenoid analysis,” says Denkin of DigiPath. “The state recommends we turn in results for nine terpenoids, we have identified 23, so we do a little more than the state requires because we feel it’s important to the patient.”

Potency is another added testing benefit in Nevada, as many reports from other states show gross mislabeling on products such as edibles. “Obviously we want the patient to have the amount of medicine they’re required to have,” says Maceo. Patients will also be getting the percentages of THC, THCA, CBD, CBDA and CBN. 

“It is essential for the medical marijuana patients to have access to cannabis products that are safe, free of any contaminating substances, and uniformly consistent,” Burnett explains. “It is also vitally important that the products are well characterized so the patient can determine which products are best suited to improving the condition for which he or she is using medical marijuana.”

Additionally, Nevada patents will have comfort in knowing the strain they’re paying for is in fact what it says it is. “Just because they say they have a ‘Blue Dream’ doesn’t mean they’re growing a Blue Dream,” notes Denkin. “It means the person they got this Blue Dream genetics from told them it was a Blue Dream. But it could be any other strain, there’s no way of trademarking or patenting these marijuana plants. The only way to determine what is inside this plant, if it really is doing what it is supposed to be doing, is based on the cannabinoid and terpenoid profiles.”

The only downside in Nevada is patients that grow their own medicine are not eligible for having their personal medication tested. The current law only allows for the labs to test marijuana from a state-approved medical marijuana establishment. However, state-approved cultivators, production facilities, edible makers and dispensaries will have tested products. 

So when can we expect to see this intensely scrutinized medical marijuana available for patients in the dispensaries? “At Ace Analytical Laboratory, we expect to be open in Q3 and will work closely with cultivators, dispensaries and producers to not only help them meet the state requirements, but assist them with optimizing their procedures and products so their offerings can be clearly differentiated in the marketplace,” Burnett says. 

“The main sticking point has been the state trying to decide where the pesticide levels will be,” says Maceo. “There is ILAC, the Independent Laboratory Committee, hat recommends to the state what should be tested for.” 

Maceo says that while the state is taking it slow, it’s not a bad thing when you think about the protection of the patient. “It’s difficult to say when we’ll be fully up and running, but I’m hoping within the next month to see people growing and most of the laboratory testing for all of these things.”

Denkin thinks Nevada is playing it smart. “Although it’s caused a delay, a bit of an uproar, I believe they’re doing everything right. DigiPath is currently open and ready to test medical marijuana. The difficulty is there are only a few licensed MMEs that have plants in the ground. There’s a couple of them here in Southern Nevada, there’s a couple in Northern Nevada, but to grow marijuana it’s a three-month process at a minimum.” 

Though the waiting is difficult, the safety will be worth it. “We can’t call this medicine on one side of it and introduce a poison on the other side of it,” Jed Tutera of G3 Labs adds. “Medical marijuana has to be safe for the consumer because some of the people have compromised immune systems and in order to call this medicine, we have to keep the tests at the most stringent levels—and that’s what Nevada is doing.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The upside of medicinal marijuana is the plant has so many healing uses, patients will be able to treat everything from lupus, fibroids, type I and 2 diabetes, endometriosis, and glaucoma to Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, PTSD, depression and arthritis.

The downside? Finding a “doctor” with hands-on medicinal cannabis experience. 
One of the biggest obstacles patients will encounter when Nevada’s dispensaries open is finding a medical professional who has significant knowledge of both cannabis-based medicines and the various diseases and conditions medicinal marijuana can treat. Patients will not only need to find a “doctor” to guide them to the correct medicine, but also the correct dose. 

Because there’s no course in medical school about medicinal cannabis, patients will have no choice but to turn to those who have been self-taught. One resource available to Southern Nevada’s patients is Lance Parvin and Adam Sternberg, co-founders of the Compassionate Awareness Project (CAP), an organization established in 2014 dedicated to helping individuals and their families who are dealing with debilitating and often terminal conditions, www.compassionawarenessprojectorg.

“This project got started because the clients we were taking were told there was nothing more that could be done for them,” Parvin, who is not a doctor, says of CAP. “A lot of people have had the hope taken away from them.”

Parvin knows that feeling all too well. He, too, had hope taken away from him. 
“The reason I originally got into this was my wife. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011,” explains Parvin. Santi Parvin had a typical course of treatment that included a lumpectomy and radiation and all seemed fine, as Parvin tells it. 

Fast forward to 2014 -- suddenly Santi started experiencing symptoms similar to vertigo. “It turned out she had brain tumors. It came out of the blue. There were no symptoms prior to the vertigo and non-stop throwing up,” he explains. 

Santi went through a suggested course of treatment of whole brain wave radiation, but it had zero effect. “It did absolutely nothing. What it did do was give her brain damage. The MRI showed that it had zero impact on the tumors. 
At this point, they said good luck. So I understand what these patients who don’t have much hope are going through.”

That’s when Parvin started using his background in Herbal Psychopharmacology to research medicinal marijuana and look at all the information and studies available. “After doing some research I decided this was a viable treatment and I started my wife on it,” relays Parvin of giving Santi cannabis oil by mouth and in gel cap form. “Within two days she was a different woman, within four weeks four of her five tumors were gone and the last one was smaller. And at that same time, she was on no other treatment.

“When her MRI showed the tumors had decreased in size, the doctors were shocked. Her friends were very surprised because she was very low in the functioning scale and almost in a vegetative state prior to taking cannabis oil.”  

According to Parvin, Santi’s doctor was so incredulous at her results that he wrote ‘WOW!’ on her MRI report and commented that Lance ‘knew more about medicine than him.’ 

Naturally, news of Santi’s miraculous results spread and, in turn, the Compassionate Awareness Project was born.

“At this point, we had been around other cancer patients who were Stage 4 and they decided they had nothing to lose because they were all being given a terminal prognosis,” explains Parvin of how he had individuals coming to him interested in trying medicinal cannabis oil. “Suddenly we were being approached by people who needed help. Over time it had an exponential effect, all of their friends and family were referring others and word started spreading.”

CAP teaches patients how to track their progress, get their medicinal marijuana card so they have legal access to cannabis oil, and educate them about dosing. “We are just consultants. We explain the different options that are out there. We try to help them so they have control of their own medicine and their own health,” explains Parvin. “We find out what their preexisting conditions are, what treatments they have had -- we go through the normal course of treatment.” 

Parvin doesn’t discourage patients from seeing their doctor or specialist and continuing with their pharmaceuticals. “In the numerous studies I have read, there have been no contraindications with medical marijuana use so we advise clients to inform their doctors that they intend to take medicinal cannabis.”
<img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/missionawareness-300x200.jpg" alt="Herbs and spices" width="300" height="200" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1710" />
Because there is so much misinformation and few places to turn for guidance with regard to medicinal cannabis, Parvin has become a resource for the medical industry. “There aren’t many people you can turn to, to find out what is correct. We work with doctors. We have had oncologists from other states call us and even scientists from other countries have called to consult with us. Minds are changing and more and more, doctors are encouraging patients to try medicinal marijuana.”

Although Parvin has found not all doctors are quite ready to make the leap. “Rather than finding things in their state and reaching out to different scientists and looking for proof of why this is working, physicians use the excuse that they don’t want their patient to get high from THC. They say, ‘they would never give them the option of medicinal marijuana,’ meanwhile they are giving them a prescription to an opiate that gets them high.”

This leads Parvin to discuss the most challenging part of championing the benefits of medicinal marijuana and shepherding the Compassionate Awareness Project through its infancy. “The hard part is changing years and years of brilliant marketing from a federal level that this is bad,” extols Parvin. “Shaking the preconceived notions the public and the private sector have about cannabis and that there is a difference between a plant and a synthetic drug.”

Parvin, who is currently consulting with approximately 50 clients in Nevada, has long-term plans for CAP. “The whole premise of the Compassionate Awareness Project is researching in this field and showing what this oil can do. So, yes, this is a long-term commitment because in the short term I have proven that it has been successful.

“As people get results, that’s true knowledge. When a patient’s cancer goes away, that’s proof. But at the end of the day, how many studies are enough? If you or a family member is dying and they get better -- that’s the only study you need and that’s what will start the change as to how people view treatment.” 

Although a lot of clients who have been advised by CAP have had positive results (see CAP client medical profiles on pages 16-18), medicinal cannabis has not provided a cure for everyone. “There are patients who have passed,” Parvin says in circumspect. “But I will say this, anyone who has chosen to use it -- their quality of life has dramatically improved, giving both the family and the patient comfort and quality of life. Even if it doesn’t save a patient, it gives them a quality of life they didn’t have.” 

Parvin emphasizes that medicinal marijuana won’t hurt people taking it and there are a lot of benefits but there is a downside with regard to the psychoactive component of the plant. “Initially when something new is introduced to the system, there is a small psychoactive effect. It’s like lucid dreaming but those components do go away in a short amount of time.”

But as Parvin is finding, if you have a loved one who is terminal and has been told there is nothing more that can be done for them, then it doesn’t matter how strongly you are against medicinal marijuana. You will try just about anything to, at the very least, bring them relief and comfort. 

Parvin understands that better than anyone because in the end his wife, Santi, didn’t make it. Perhaps if they had eschewed traditional medicine and she would have had access to medicinal cannabis sooner she would still be here. And that certainly lends to his motivation in founding the Compassionate Awareness Project. He passionately concludes, “People should be mad because if you have ever lost a loved one to a disease that this plant could fix then you should be angry.”

But in spite of his zealous belief in the healing benefits of medicinal cannabis, Parvin isn’t forcing himself on anyone. “I am not a used car salesman for cannabis,” he says. “The whole reason people come to CAP is to be aware and see what’s out there. I tell the people who come to me to explore all their options. I just try to put the power back in the client’s hands. I tell people they have lots of options, they should explore them and ultimately they will make the decision that works best for them.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Few people, especially a 25-year-old man, could appreciate the gift of life more than Tim Buck (he requested that his real name not be used) who suffered from a near-death experience at the tender age of nine.  

The way Buck tells it, he hadn’t been feeling well for a week. He told his mom he was tired, weak and thirsty so she took him to the family doctor where he was promptly diagnosed with allergies. Buck was sent on his way with orders to drink plenty of fruit juice.

That evening, Buck was too weak to hold his head up. His panicked mother rushed him to the emergency room where he slipped into a coma, the result of diabetic ketoacidosis. Overwhelmed by the sugars of the juice he’d been drinking, Buck’s pancreas, the organ responsible for making the insulin that breaks down blood glucose, had failed. 

Buck was dying. 

Despite expectations otherwise, Buck recovered. But the ensuing years have been a progression of specialists, tests, and medications. Now living as an insulin-dependent diabetic, he is blind in one eye and suffers chronic diabetic nerve pain or neuropathy. Ensuring his blood sugar levels stay stable is particularly difficult since his pancreas is so damaged.

Buck’s involvement in patient support groups made him aware of medical marijuana, but it was the cancer diagnosis of his friend that bore witness to its positive impact. When Santi Parvin started cannabis in the wake of inoperable brain cancer, her husband, Lance, shared the positive progress with Buck. “That’s when I started using cannabis oil,” he says.

Buck takes the sticky, earthy oil orally every day. “The relief is subtle, each day the pain lessens and is so gradual you don’t realize the improvement until someone or something brings it to your attention of how well you are doing. Then you notice the wonderful relief from pain,” Buck explains. 

Within three months the pain became manageable; the muscle tremors preventing simple tasks, like holding a fork to eat, are all but gone.

Buck’s endocrinologist knows about his cannabis oil use and approves. Buck explains, “My doctor knew all about it, but could not prescribe it or dispense it for fear of losing his license as a doctor and possibly serving jail time.” Instead, Buck’s physician reviews his lab results and sees progress through things like A1C values and, remarkably, the need for less insulin. 

“I’m using only half as much [insulin] and feel a lot better, and I am losing weight, too!”

		<title>HEALING: the power of medical cannabis – Spinal Damage Secondary to Car Crash, Sports Injuries</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Motivated by the thought of spending some time with his beloved, Mike James (he requested that his real name not be used), 40, pulled himself from the exhaustion of his long shift as a power company lineman to visit his girlfriend. 

It was the summer of 2000, and he recalls leaving her house. “It was night and the road was dark with a curve in it. I closed my eyes for a second and when I opened them I had run right into a pole.”

James ended up in the emergency room followed by a night’s stay in the hospital. He didn’t break anything, but he did sustain spinal damage. 

Like a crooked xylophone, James’ spine has a number of herniations from his neck to his lower back -- all playing a concerto of chronic pain. Some days are worse than others. Physical therapy and martial arts helped strengthen the muscles surrounding his vertebrae, but it did little for nerve compression. That’s when he’d pop narcotics like Percocet and Vicodin.

 “Daddy had a lot of anger and other issues taking ‘legal’ drugs,”describes James of himself. The opiates didn’t just cause agitation and diminish his libido, they also compromised his ability to do an already dangerous job so James would forgo pain medication before work only to gobble them up upon returning home. It was no way to live for an involved father of two, ages 8 and 10. 

It was James’ friendship with Lance Parvin that made him aware of the pain-relieving properties of medical marijuana. James decided cannabis oil would be preferable to prescription painkillers because he heard it lessened the psychoactive effects. 

“When I used recreational marijuana before, it was different,” notes James, “I guess it was more for fun and finding a different place, but now utilizing medical marijuana is about enhancing my physical health, which has also enhanced my performance.” He says it took one week of taking cannabis oil orally to find relief from pain and to stop the narcotics. Another unintended side effect is James’ improved libido. “I’m like a teenager again.”

James may feel like a teenager, but he’s fully aware of his adult responsibilities. His two children do not know the improvement in their father’s temperament is the result of using cannabis nor the discreet method he chooses to take it, but he says, “It’s an issue I will deal with when they are mature enough.” 

Although he no longer dangles from bucket-truck platforms, James now supervises other electrical lineman. He’s somewhat conflicted about the source of his improved quality of life and the sobering reality that he’s one drug test away from joblessness. “You have to make a choice and ask if the risk is worth it?” says James, “For me, it will be a change in employment.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At age 68, Bette Richards (she requested that her real name not be used), has lived most of her life with chronic pain -- the consequence of a heart condition and a more recent diagnosis of fibromyalgia and glaucoma.

Even with a cabinet of medications ranging from anti-inflammatories to steroids, Richards was in agony. Every pill had an undesirable side effect. Being “out of it” was neither practical nor desirable to Richards who still has responsibilities helping an adult son manage his own chronic health issues. 

When Richards’ physician asks her what her pain level is using a scale of 1 to 10, Richards routinely responds with “11.”

“I was in so much pain one year that there were days I couldn’t function at all. Simple everyday functions were impossible,” Richards explains. She uses the past-tense because for the last year she’s been taking cannabis oil. 

She opted for cannabis oil, taken orally, versus the legally available Cannabidiol or CBD at the advice of several friends who say the former is less processed, making it more therapeutically valuable. She also finds taking it in capsule form more palatable.

It was Richards’ son’s coach who suggested she might find value in the pain-relieving properties of the cannabis plant. Coach Lance Parvin remarked that some of his other training clients used medical marijuana to treat the discomfort of old injuries and there were others with autoimmune diseases who found the plant helpful in the long-term management of its unpredictable symptoms.

As Richards sees it, “When you have tried every possible medication prescribed by doctors and have received unsatisfactory results, and you are not being cured and keep on getting sicker and sicker with more side effects, think about it, what do you have to lose by trying a God-given plant that’s been in existence for centuries and has been documented for healing?”

In four short weeks, taking cannabis daily has given Richards a life worth living instead of being crippled by fibromyalgia’s widespread muscle pain or glaucoma’s stinging blur. She also sleeps better than she has in years. Richards’ primary care doctor encourages Richards’ continued use of the oil for the pain-relieving properties, though she continues to manage Richards’ glaucoma and heart condition with traditional prescription medications.  

Richards says she never expected to be taking what was once only the purview of stoners, but she has become a champion for letting people know about her results and for good reason. “The government doesn’t want any of us to be healthy, they want a nation of sick people because sickness is money.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In days gone by, the only thing that mattered when you were buying marijuana was how much Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) it had. Even Absolem, the blue caterpillar from Lewis Carroll’s book “Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland” would have turned up his nose at cannabis that did not register a healthy amount of THC.
In fact, the old axiom leftover from cannabis’ black market days, or from dispensaries that existed many years ago, was that if marijuana had less than 10 percent THC, it was considered bottom shelf or regular-grade cannabis. 

But when shifting the focus away from THC content to the cannabinoid profile and terpenes of cannabis, it becomes all about medical or connoisseur/lifestyle cannabis consumption.

When you purchase medicine from dispensaries that has been tested by independent labs in Nevada, you will see a cornucopia of terpenes listed on each label. Terpenes are the aromatic compounds that give each cannabis plant its unique smell — interacting with THC and CBD — and therapeutic effect. Terpenes provide many lovely bouquets — ranging from lavender and pine to orange and oregano — when you put your nose into a bag or jar at a dispensary.

Terpenes also balance the psycho-activity in high THC strains, in turn reducing THC-induced anxiety. For example, you might decide to treat your back pain with the strain Bruce Banner #3 that has over 28 percent THC but a strong amount of terpenes so you could still join your friends for dinner.

Some of the common therapeutic terpenes in cannabis include Alpha-pinene (pine oil), which is a bronchodilator helpful for those with asthma that also promotes alertness and memory retention — advantageous when counting cards at a blackjack table in a smoky casino.

Myrcene (thyme and lemon grass) is a terpene that assists with reducing inflammation and pain, sedation and relaxing muscles — it proves helpful as a sleep aid after a hard day of work standing on your feet.

Limonene (citrus oil) improves mood, is antibacterial, and helps with gastrointestinal disorders — try some Lemon Kush after a day indulging at a Las Vegas buffet. Linalool (lavender oil) is great for helping reduce anxiety and increasing happiness — Mother Nature’s Prozac when you need it.
Beta-caryophyllene (black pepper and oregano oil) benefits those with ulcers, autoimmune disorders and inflammation.

Top-shelf cannabis does not have to have a THC percentage over 18 percent. It is the smell and taste of the medicine consumed, created by the terpenes and proper cultivation curing techniques, that matter to a true connoisseur. When you elect to use a clean vaporizer or water pipe, though preferably rolling paper, the “nose” or smell of the cannabis from the terpenes is pronounced in the sensory experience.
As a cannabis patient, with help from the budtender at your local dispensary, you will soon distinguish terpene profiles that are not only medically therapeutic, but offer a pleasant kaleidoscopic of aromas worthy of a caterpillar on a mushroom.

<h2>WASHINGTON</h2>
<p>On July 1st, Washington Governor Jay Inslee signed a new measure into law that revises the tax structure of the state’s recreational marijuana law. The new law eliminates the current three-tier tax structure and replaces it with a single excise tax of 37 percent at the point of sale. To encourage more cities and counties to allow marijuana businesses in their jurisdictions, the bill directs the state to share pot revenue. It also allows jurisdictions to adopt more flexible zoning for where pot grows and where MMEs can be located.</p>

<h2>OREGON</h2> 
<p>As of July 1st, marijuana became legal for adults in Oregon when a ballot initiative approved by voters in November 2014 officially took effect. The Control, Regulation, and Taxation of Marijuana and Industrial Hemp Act allows adults 21 years of age and older to possess up to eight ounces of marijuana and grow up to four marijuana plants. State officials are in the process of establishing a regulated system of commercial marijuana cultivation and sales.</p>

 <h2>COLORADO</h2>
<p>In mid-July, the Colorado Board of Health voted 6-2 not to make Colorado the 10th state to allow medicinal marijuana use for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The board voted against the recommendation of the state’s chief medical officer who said listing PTSD as a treatable condition would increase transparency, reveal actual usage, and shed light on its effectiveness. Currently allowed uses of medical marijuana under the state’s program include pain, cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, muscles spasms, multiple sclerosis, severe nausea and wasting disease.</p>

<h2>PENNSYLVANIA</h2>
<p>The Pennsylvania State House Health Committee voted unanimously on June 26 to approve SB 3, which would allow Pennsylvanians access to medical marijuana. The bill now goes to the House Rules Committee for further consideration. The Senate approved SB 3 by a vote of 40-7 on May 12 which would allow patients with serious medical conditions to obtain medical marijuana from a limited number of licensed, regulated dispensaries throughout the state. Patients would be allowed to consume marijuana in edible form and through vaporization. </p>

<h2>TEXAS</h2> 
<p>On June 1 Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill legalizing the limited use of marijuana extracts for severe forms of epilepsy. The law allows the use of cannabis oils -- high in CBD, a non-euphoric compound found in marijuana, and low in THC, the main psychoactive ingredient -- to treat intractable epilepsy. The state will oversee the regulation and distribution of the cannabis oil, which is only available to patients who have tried at least two traditional epilepsy medications and have found them not to be effective. The patient must also get the approval of two doctors before being able to take advantage of the new law.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here’s a statistic that will certainly make you do a double-take the next time your physician writes you a prescription for a painkiller. The United States uses 99 percent of the world’s entire hydrocodone (the active ingredient in Lortab, Norco) supply and 80 percent of the world’s opioids, according to the Institute of Addiction Medicine. The nation’s painkiller problem is such that Time magazine called it the worst addiction crisis America has ever seen on its June 15th cover. 

These are certainly some statistics to give you pause and the curiosity to find out more about how opioids have come to have such a perilous grasp on Americans. 

Used to alleviate pain, opioids exert their effects by binding to opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system. Opioids are widely used in the U.S. and their use in the treatment of non-cancer pain is staggering, as mentioned above. 

Most clinicians prescribe opioids for treatment of chronic pain. However, there is very little evidence to support long-term use of opioids for treatment of non-cancer pain. In fact, the adverse effects associated with opioids become much more prominent with each escalating opioid dose. The latter occurs as patients develop a tolerance to their current level of medication and find the opioid less “effective” than when they first initiated treatment.  

As a nation we have also become used to quick remedies. If someone has pain, they are prescribed opioids; if someone can’t sleep, they acquire a sleeping pill; if someone has anxiety, they get an anxiolytic; if someone has muscle spasms, they obtain a muscle relaxant, and so on. 

<h3>The Opioid Shift</h3>
Since the 1990s there has been a dramatic shift in the medical practice paradigm -- from withholding painkillers to treating patients with chronic pain using opioids. This change in the medical model has brought on adverse effects. Opioids produce significant side effects; the most common being divided into two categories, the central effects (nausea, sedation, respiratory depression, miosis [pinpoint pupils], hypotension) and the peripheral effects (constipation, hives, urinary retention, bronchospasms). 

But the most concerning part of this trend is that the number of people that die from opioid overdose has increased 300 percent since 1999 and over 15,000 people die of opioid overdose per year.<sup>1</sup>  
Furthermore, for every one death there are:
<ul class="list">
<li>10 treatment admissions for abuse <sup>2</sup></li>
<li>32 ER visits for misuse or abuse <sup>3</sup></li> 
<li>130 people who abuse or are dependent <sup>4</sup></li>
<li>825 nonmedical users <sup>4</sup></li>
<li>One in 20 people 12 years or older reported using opioids for nonmedical reasons.<sup>5,6</sup></li>
</ul>

<h3>Do opioids and medicinal cannabis make an effective cocktail?</h3>
There is a real challenge in controlling pain while at the same time allowing patients to function. With the passage of medical cannabis laws in 23 states and the District of Columbia, clinicians now face another challenge: Addressing patients that are on chronic opioid therapy and use medical cannabis. How safe is the combination of these two controlled substances? Does the combination of these medications lead to abuse of other substances such as alcohol and illicit drugs? 

<h3>Can medical cannabis be used as a substitute or adjuvant therapy to opioids?</h3>
Two of the most cited concerns with the use of medical cannabis relates to the psychoactive properties of the plant and the possibility of it leading to more serious drug use, especially among users of opioids. Recent studies have attempted to address these concerns and found that in the states where medical cannabis is legal, there is an upside in the form of a significant decrease (24.8 percent) in the opioid overdose mortality rate.<sup>7</sup> 

Furthermore, a recent study concluded that concomitant use of medical cannabis and opioids did not correlate with subsequent increase in alcohol and other drug use such as cocaine, sedatives, street opioids, and amphetamines. In this study, the patients who used medical cannabis reported better pain management and a desire to reduce their opioid intake.<sup>8</sup>  

<h3>Can medicinal cannabis turn the tide on opioid use?</h3>
Cannabis exerts its effects by interacting with the body’s endocannabinoid system. This complex system is an important part of human physiology as most of the organs in the body have some association with this system. There is evidence that activation of this system in certain areas can decrease several types of pain perception, including new onset pain (acute), pain related to nerves (neuropathic), and pain associated with ongoing inflammation. <sup>9</sup>

Additionally, the body also produces its own molecules that interact with the endocannabinoid system. 

This is similar to the body producing its own pain molecules, such as endorphins, that help reduce pain. Studies have proposed that interaction of the endocannabinoid system can alleviate pain on its own and separate from how opioids work.<sup>10</sup>  

The molecules produced by the body that act on the endocannabinoid system are called endogenous cannabinoids. These molecules act in many of the brain’s pain centers to alleviate pain. In addition to working separately from opioids, research has shown improved pain relief when an artificial cannabinoid is added to the regimen of subjects already taking opioids.<sup>11,12</sup>  This is consistent with earlier studies that demonstrated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) releases the body’s own opioid molecules which helps decrease pain. Combination therapy with THC and opioids exhibits synergistic properties in animal models.<sup>13</sup>  

Further research in these and several other aspects of medical cannabis and opioids are needed to accurately address the concerns of a combination therapy. Human trials are absolutely necessary to provide answers to some of these pressing questions faced by healthcare providers, as well as patients. As a clinician, these are very exciting times for the prospects of new cannabinoid therapies to help alleviate pain and lessen the side effects of opioid therapy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An impressive forty million Americans use fitness apps or activity trackers. It’s a massive audience that is primed and ready to be daily users of Cannafit. Launching this October, Cannafit is a health, wellness, nutrition and fitness web application custom made for the medical marijuana industry that includes THC and CBD dosage tracking and is HIPAA compliant.

“Cannafit offers the ability to combine diet and exercise with the responsible use of cannabis for an optimal outcome,” explains Peter Boehm, Cannafit CEO and co-founder. “We operate at the intersection of those people using wellness apps and the legalization of medicinal marijuana.”

And it’s quite a busy intersection mainly full of women eager to take care of their inner health and wellness. “As we get older, we become more sensitive to what we eat and what lifestyle we lead. The female over 35 drives $4.3 trillion revenue into the marketplace as CEO of her household,” further explains Boehm of the audience Cannafit appeals to. “They want an experience, they want engagement and they want value-add services. And they want it all to integrate with the mobile devices they use.”

A business-to-business application, Cannafit expects to have 250 and 300 dispensaries when the app launches in October. And there’s a good reason they are lining up. Dispensaries find Cannafit invaluable because of the wealth of information available to them via the app including predictive analytics that can drive business back to them and the ability to track users buying habits via members logging their loyalty points. Additionally, Cannafit is careful not to receive or distribute anyone’s personal information.

“We are not the brand, we are the brand behind the brand,” Boehm describes of Cannafit. “This platform provides all of these deep analytics that aren’t available anywhere in the industry. 

We can provide user demographics and show dispensaries what their customers are planning to buy, what they are using and what they are interested in.”
But Cannafit is not just about mass consumer engagement, Boehm also cites community goodwill as another benefit to the platform. “This entire industry was founded on one very important principle -- states were given the right to legalize medicinal marijuana based on the medicinal and therapeutic value of it. The industry has done a really poor job of reinforcing the health and wellness side of things. 

We are the tool to do that, whether people are suffering from a medical condition or just want to be healthy and fit, we are the tool to help them incorporate cannabis into their lifestyle.

“Cannafit is an online web app that helps consumers achieve a better quality of life through a robust suite of menus, trackers, guides and physician reporting tools,” concludes Boehm. 
“In essence, Cannafit uses technology to promote a better quality of life.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The influence of a city that is at the pinnacle of gourmet dining has reverberated to the medicinal cannabis industry. Las Vegas’ fine dining environment has impacted one cultivation and production entity to the point of creating French-inspired medibles. 

Evergreen Organix Cultivation and Production has hired three chefs and a licensed dietician to create a broad line of medibles featuring sugar-free, non-GMO, organic and vegan-style products that range from cookies to chocolate squares.  

“We have done quite a few tastings. I, myself, have never been into vegan and GMO so I was in shock with just how incredible the tastes were. Everything they have produced has been phenomenal,” enthuses Kurt Barrick, master grower for Evergreen Organix Cultivation and Production, www.evergreenorganix.com. 

Barrick’s favorite medible so far has been an Oatmeal Chocolate Cookie. “I am not a big chocolate fan and it didn’t have any sugar in it and I couldn’t believe how good it tasted. Once they are on the market, I think the word of mouth is just going to explode.” 

The secret to the delicious taste is Evergreen’s CO2 extraction machine. “The machine extracts the medicine from the plant and leaves everything else behind including the marijuana taste,” reveals Barrick of making Evergreen’s two medible lines: Ego and Evergreen. “In the past, people used to be able to taste the cannabis. Now if you are making a recipe for Grandma’s brownie, it tastes just like Grandma’s brownie. It’s a very clean and quality process.” 

Another quality component is the design/build of Evergreen’s 30,000-square-foot cultivation facility and production kitchen. “Evergreen’s focus has really been on sterilization during the design of the facility so we can use the least amount of pesticides and provide the cleanest product possible. 

“We are just trying to establish and set the quality standard. Patients deserve a very clean product and we are anti-microbial from floor to lid,” reports Barrick of the variety of medibles Evergreen is making for patients with conditions that include HIV/AIDs, cancer, asthma, peanut allergies, and diabetics with sugar issues. “Our products are not a prescription, but rather a recommendation based on other patients’ use and experience.”  

Safety is another priority, says Barrick, who estimates Evergreen will be fully operational by early September with product available around the holidays. “This is a medical product so our packaging is double safety child resistant. I have done this for a long time and Evergreen is diligent about doing everything possible utilizing today’s technology to have the safest, cleanest, most consistent product we possibly can.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Ace Analytical Laboratory founders on the forefront of safe cannabis care

Ace Analytical Laboratory co-founders Kris Madsen and Bruce Burnett are not your typical laboratory owners. In fact, it wasn’t even their idea to get in the business of testing medicinal cannabis. 

Although Madsen is a self-described serial entrepreneur, it was a business associate who suggested she pursue obtaining a laboratory license through the state of Nevada last year. “I was in the market to buy another business and I went to a friend to review P&Ls to get his opinion on potential businesses. As we were discussing the prospects, he asked why I wasn’t getting in the medicinal marijuana testing business.”

The idea clicked instantly. Madsen approached her husband Dr. Bruce Burnett, an anesthesiologist, and the rest is history. “We have been working on this since last May and it’s been like drinking from a fire hose. We have been diligent in reviewing the entire cannabis movement, and are enthusiastically pursuing the dream of opening our lab,” said Madsen who secured a provisional state license last November, has been taking delivery of lab equipment, and anticipates receiving final state approval to begin operations during the beginning of the third quarter of 2015.

Madsen’s associate was right, she and Burnett are obvious choices for the medicinal cannabis industry. The duo not only knows how to get things done quickly, but as Madsen explains, “Bruce has extensive experience in dealing with understanding the incredible benefits the proper drugs can bring to patients in need. He understands how the right drugs can benefit patients with certain disorders, is very comfortable in the lab environment and understands the testing methodology.”

There’s certainly no question about Burnett’s medical knowledge when he speaks about cannabis’ future as a medicinal/pharmacological compound. “We are at the very early stages of understanding the complex human endocannabinoid system and the many specific conditions for which we may be able to develop clinically relevant treatments utilizing compounds derived from cannabis,” explains Burnett. “The scientific and medical understanding of cannabis and its myriad interactions with human diseases and conditions is set to explode over the near term. I thoroughly believe that it will be one of the more exciting areas for research in medicine over the next several decades.”

While Burnett is excited about cannabis’ medical ramifications, Madsen is fervent about Ace Analytical Laboratory’s, www.aalabnv.com, future in the industry. “We are passionate about healthcare and want to make 
sure what gets introduced into the Las Vegas community is safe, efficacious and used properly,” says Madsen. “We also know that we can be on the forefront of ‘how good it can get’ for people who are suffering from a wide range of diseases and conditions.”

After several stops and starts over the last several months, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/euphoriawellnessnv" target="_blank">Euphoria Wellness</a>, located at 7780 S. Jones Blvd., has received final state and county approvals to be the first dispensary in Southern Nevada to open its doors.

Because product is limited, during its first two days of operation, Euphoria Wellness will only be selling medicinal cannabis to customers who have pre-registered with the dispensary. Starting on Wednesday the dispensary will be selling to anyone with their Nevada medicinal marijuana card, of which there are approximately 6,700 patients registered in Clark County. Euphoria will limit each patient to half an ounce of marijuana until supply becomes more plentiful.

Euphoria Wellness had expected to open earlier this year using home-grown product from patient growers but encountered legal snags. When they open on Monday they will be selling crops grown commercially. Euphoria is not the first dispensary to open in Nevada. Silver State Relief, located in Sparks, Nevada, claimed that distinction opening its doors on July 31st.

		<title>Finally Legal: Sharing a Moment in Las Vegas’ Medicinal Marijuana History</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My receipt let me know I was #77 – not only a fortuitous number but the 77th person to buy medical marijuana legally in Las Vegas. For me, this was not just historic but personal because I am a medicinal marijuana cardholder. Most people think I use it for recreational, which I am for, but I became a patient for medical purposes. By the age of 17 I was diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) and I have found cannabis is the only thing that brings me relief. I do not medicate during the day, even though I am in pain. But enough about me, let’s get to history.</p>
<p>I arrived at Euphoria Wellness at 9:30 a.m. on Monday before they opened their doors at 10 a.m. Congresswoman Dina Titus, the owners of Euphoria, and their general manager were doing press interviews and preparing for the ribbon cutting. Euphoria was hoping to be the first dispensary to open in Nevada but Silver State Relief in Sparks beat them to it, opening at the end of July. But being the first dispensary to open in Las Vegas is still a huge accomplishment and a welcome development for the many patients, like me, who are seeking medicine to help with ongoing conditions and ailments.</p>
<p>I didn’t have time to buy medicine in the morning so I returned to Euphoria at around 12:30 p.m. I was greeted by a bouncer or as MMEs and nightclubs call them, security. He requested my medicinal marijuana patient card and my driver’s license. He checked them and suggested I stand in the shade of the building until a person or two exited the dispensary.  </p>
<img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/euphoriawellnesstwo-300x225.jpg" alt="Euphoria Wellness Opening" width="300" height="225" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1796" />
<p>A few minutes later I was ushered into the waiting room to join a diverse crowd. I noticed an older patient decked out in a Chanel suit who was with her caregiver as well as an older man who wore a Combat Medic baseball cap so was probably retired military. The rest of the patients were different races, mostly middle age and older who were excited to purchase their medicine legally. A middle-aged man was trying to cheer on the waiting room while the others made the uncomfortable chuckle and grin since they did not want to converse.  </p>
<p>Trent, the bouncer/mediator in the Euphoria waiting room, reviewed with me some of the pamphlets Euphoria was handing out which included a listing of the strains the dispensary carried and the various illnesses and conditions each of them addressed (pictured). At the time of this post, Nevada’s two legal dispensaries are only carrying flower. Edibles, concentrates and tinctures will be available in the future but that availability is dependent on the cultivations. </p>
<p>They called my name assuring me the wait time during my next visit would be shorter. It had only been about 15 – 20 minutes which is better than most doctors’ offices. I gave them my pre-registration form, driver’s license and medical marijuana patient card. It took about two minutes for them to check my credentials because they were verifying everything directly with the state. Again they asked me to sit back down and told me I would be called in soon. While I was waiting, I went through the list of strains and decided on my purchase based on my conditions.</p> 
<a href="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/strainlist.jpg"><img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/strainlist-1024x154.jpg" alt="strainlist"  class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1800 img-responsive" /></a>
<p>Within 3-5 minutes they called me in to the sample bar. Each of the six strains Euphoria had available was housed in small cylinder containers with holes in them so I could smell their aroma. In the display case next to the sample bar, Euphoria carries vaporizers and other accessories that can be used to administer medicine. I ordered ¼ ounce of Kosher Kush and a ¼ ounce of Blue Dream. (Nevada medicinal marijuana patients are legally allowed to purchase 2.5 ounces every two weeks and can possess 2 ounces of medicine at any given time.) 
Overall my medicinal cannabis buying experience took approximately 30 minutes and was easy because Euphoria’s staff is well-trained, friendly, and thorough. Thanks to Euphoria Wellness for inviting me to be a part of their opening day and this historical moment. </p>
Salute!
Guy

		<title>G3 Labs brings 90 years of Experience to MME Industry</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Armed with a Ph.D. in Forest Science with a focus on plant responses to cultivation factors, it seems curious Dr. ChaoHsiung Tung would opt to be the Chief Science Officer and a managing member of G3 Labs, g3labsllc.com, rather than take a prominent post in cultivation. 

“During my last four years when I was in my Ph.D. program, I was working for a consulting firm and we did large greenhouse production,” Dr. Tung reveals of his stint in the production 
of seedlings and usage of pesticides 
in the cultivation business.

“So when I walk into a cannabis cultivation facility, it’s déjà vu to me. I have done this before,” explains Dr. Tung. “But I am in the point of my life that it is about where can I contribute more to the community.”

Dr. Tung’s ties to the Las Vegas community are deep, too. From 1989 to 2001, he was a Senior Scientist at the $42 billion Yucca Mountain Project where he supervised over 100 scientists and multiple science laboratories. He definitely sees similarities between his work with nuclear waste and the cannabis industry.

“I am still protecting the environment and still protecting the population, but in a different way,” says Dr. Tung of ensuring medical marijuana remains safe for the consumer. 

Another similarity between the two industries is compliance. “It’s not only chemistry, it’s a compliance business. I am really good at marrying compliance with technology because of my federal programs background. As a lab we pride ourselves on our compliance background because it’s very strong,” explains Dr. Tung of G3’s combined 90 years of experience in analytical lab compliance on federal, state and local levels.

So internationally renowned for their compliance expertise, Dr. Tung as well as his counterpart James Clark, G3’s quality assurance manager, have both been invited to audit other labs including USGS, Los Alamos National Lab, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 

Dr. Tung is also well respected a little closer to home having been appointed as one of eight committee members to Nevada’s Independent Laboratory Advisory Committee (ILAC), which was established in order to recommend how marijuana should be grown and tested.  

“I am very glad Nevada has put ourselves as a benchmark to regulate things stringently and for the protection of the population,” Dr. Tung remarks of the state’s lab regulations.

		<title>New Legislation Prohibits Home Extraction of Concentrated Cannabis Oil</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“There is a slow but steady shift away from the traditional method of consuming marijuana -— smoking it —  to new delivery methods.”
-Marijuana policy group, market size and demand for marijuana in colorado, 2014

Patients have had the right to use medical marijuana in Nevada for over a decade. However, patients have not always had a legal way to obtain their medicine. Patients have been able to grow up to 12 plants and able to possess up to 2.5 ounces of flower or extracted cannabis since 2013. Patients have had to rely on their ability to produce their own medicine until Nevada’s licensed dispensaries open. 

As recognized by the Marijuana Policy Group in 2014, more patients are relying on new delivery methods for their medicine. Many of these delivery methods require the making of cannabis concentrate. Patients have learned methods to make such concentrate in their homes. In turn, the increase of patient home extraction has arguably led to an increase in home explosions. 

Due to the risk of home extraction when the method is not done properly, Nevada’s law enforcement community desired to restrict a patient’s ability to extract. The Nevada Legislature agreed that there was a risk associated with in-home extraction. Thus, during the 2015 Legislative Session a bill was passed to restrict cannabis extraction. 

As of July 1, 2015 it is now illegal for patients to extract concentrated cannabis. 
Concentrated cannabis is: “The extracted or separated resin, whether crude or purified, containing THC or CBD from marijuana.”  The act of “extracting” is, “The process or act of extracting THC or CBD from marijuana, including, without limitation, pushing, pulling or drawing out THC or CBD from marijuana.” (Senate Bill 447)

To be clear, the change in the law does not prohibit patients from possessing concentrated cannabis. Patients are still permitted to possess concentrated cannabis. Yet, the only place patients can legally obtain the extracted cannabis is from a state licensed medical marijuana dispensary. 

Pursuant to the new law, state licensed medical marijuana production facilities can extract concentrated cannabis and state licensed dispensaries can sell the concentrated cannabis to patients. Thus, patients who rely on concentrated cannabis as the method of delivery for their medicine will need to purchase that medicine from Nevada’s dispensaries. 

However, a big issue is that patients lost the right to extract cannabis as of July 1, 2015 and no state licensed dispensaries were open at the time. Therefore, patients may need to identify other methods of delivery until dispensaries are able to provide patients with the concentrated cannabis that they need. 

Ultimately, the change in the law was made out of a concern for safety; however, many patients may view the change as further restricting access to their medicine. Patients should be aware that extracting cannabis in their home is a criminal activity and they could face criminal charges and possibly jail time 
if they are caught.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>[dropcap]C[/dropcap]alling herself "the least active activist there is," singer-songwriter-guitarist Melissa Etheridge continues finding herself at the forefront of social, political and ecological movements that run the spectrum of gay rights to saving the environment.</strong>

[quote]Believe me, I only wanted to be a rock star. I just wanted to be rich and famous, I didn't want to do any of this, but it has become the path.[/quote]

“Believe me, I only wanted to be a rock star. I just wanted to be rich and famous, I didn’t want to do any of this,” Etheridge says with a laugh, “but it has become the path.”

She continues, “I see myself as just somebody who is living life and making choices and speaking truthfully about them. And because I am on a public stage I answer truthfully about it and it gets magnified out there so it looks like I am quite an activist but I tell people I am the least active activist there is. I just speak truthfully about it and say, look, this is my truth.”

Since rocketing to stardom as a result of her 1993 hit album Yes I Am which produced hit songs “Come to my Window,” “I’m the Only One” and “If I Wanted To,” Etheridge has had 20+ years to become familiar with a rocker’s mantra of sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll. 

However, the 54-year-old eschewed the usual rock star perils to find her high in music. So there’s a note of irony that the raspy-voiced singer would now be speaking up for cannabis – making it her latest cause of choice.

But really, it should come as no surprise that once again the anti-activist is on a mission with a personal story to tell -- one that begins with a diagnosis of breast cancer in October 2004. 

Etheridge turned to cannabis to combat the side effects of chemotherapy with “no hesitation whatsoever,” she explains of her treatment for breast cancer. “It was so clear to me. I wasn’t a regular cannabis user. I definitely enjoyed it. It was probably my choice of relaxation over drinking, but I wasn’t a consistent user. 

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/melissa-etheridge-1-1024x493.jpg" alt="Melissa Etheridge " width="100%" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1856" />

“Then when I was diagnosed and knew the treatment I was going to go through, my friends, especially David Crosby, said, ‘Melissa, anybody who has gone through this they say cannabis, just do it now.’ The doctor offered me five different kinds of pills for the side effects of the chemo and they would tell me about the side effects that the pills would have, and I was like are you kidding me? I said, ‘No, I will just take this one natural herb that will take care of everything.’”

To combat pain and to stimulate her appetite, Etheridge first started medicating with cannabis by smoking it. “Then in the deepest depths of chemo, it got to the point where that was too harsh for me and I vaped it for a while. At the very end of the chemo, I would just have to ingest it. We would make a cannabutter and I would just put the butter on potatoes and eat that.” 

One of the main reasons Etheridge turned to cannabis was for anxiety relief. “There’s so much anxiety and panic in this treatment and it would take that down to where you could kind of start thinking on a different level. It’s hard to explain. It just helps you handle everything differently, it gets you in a calm space.”

It has been over 10 years since Etheridge had her bout with breast cancer but she continues to use cannabis. “It’s my relaxant of choice. At the end of it day, it helps me sleep. It still takes away my anxiety. I have a full career and four children and there’s a little bit of anxiety that comes with that,” she says with a small laugh. “It helps with that. I use different products. I use a rub for muscles. It’s just a big part of my life.” 

Such a big part of Etheridge’s life that she was keynote speaker at the 2nd Annual Cannabis World Congress and Business Expo (CWCBExpo) in mid-September, is part owner in a dispensary, and has created her own line of cannabis-infused wine called Know Label. 

“I was so moved and changed by my health experience and by cannabis that I actively went out and searched for what I could do,” the singer says of her ownership in a dispensary. “I am very vocal about this and I believe very greatly in it. I believe it’s the next frontier.”

In the attempts to legitimize cannabis, Etheridge sees shades of past social causes she has fought to change.

“I feel it is so similar to the LGBT marriage equality fight because there are so many cannabis users who are in the closet, who are afraid to say they are cannabis users because they will be stereotyped. There’s a stereotype that, ‘Oh you are stoner, you are a pothead,’ and people think you can’t do your job as well or whatever they bring to that thought. I tell people it’s about coming out of the closet, tell people about it, be proud of it, there’s pride in it, you are taking care of yourself, talk about it in your family, talk about it everywhere. Each of us needs to show that they are a cannabis user and their life is fine. That’s the way change comes is to get rid of fear.”

True to her word, Etheridge practices what she preaches. She is very open with her children about her cannabis use. “The way we talk about it in this house, is this is medicine. My little daughter, I remember her asking a couple of years ago, ‘Do you smoke?’ I said, ‘I do not smoke cigarettes. Cigarettes are very different than the medicine that momma smokes.’ And we always refer to it as medicine.”

But educating people about cannabis’ medicinal value, Etheridge acknowledges, is going to have its share of challenges. “As my friend Steven Spielberg always said, ‘That in any movement there are the people who laid down on the barbwire so everything else can go over them.’ That’s kind of what we are. We are the front lines, we are the ones who are pushing this and taking the risks. And we will reap the rewards and we will win. That’s where we are going. That’s society, it’s a freedom, it’s an understanding, it’s a way of life that we had over 100 years ago and we will return to. But it’s not like going back, it’s moving forward with an understanding of this and how good it is for us.” 

Etheridge is not only passionate about a person’s right to use cannabis but in her belief of the plant’s natural remedies. “Cannabis is the head bird in the v, it’s the tip of the spear. In the new way, in the new age, in the new paradigm of health, we are finally beginning to understand that we are responsible for our own personal health. That starts with my body and the food I put into it and its maintenance.

“Our circulation, our nervous system, our lymph system, all of the different systems in our body, our gastrointestinal system, they all work together and we give it all the best food and we use plant medicines for calming and lowering stress. You can do all these great things but if you are stressed, forget it you are just going to get sick. Stress is a big thing we just don’t look at in our American problem-solving consciousness life and so cannabis has been a big part of slowing me down to look at that. 

“Our diseases are a result of what is going on inside us and cannabis helps us find and maintain that balance. Cannabis is helping us find that understanding that that’s how it works.”

In fact Etheridge’s biggest health revelation has to do with her cancer treatment in 2004. “If I knew what I know now, I wouldn’t have done chemo or radiation. I might not have even done the surgery the way that I understand my body and cancer now.

“I have a deep belief and call me crazy, call me names, whatever you wanna say, I believe very deeply that cancer is a symptom of a body out of balance and you can put that body back in balance and cancer is made to go away. A tumor is when our bodies realize that our cells have gone rogue, they have been in so much acid that they go bad and then our body covers them in a tumor so that we can see it and it says, ‘Hey, you better take care of this.’ If we get our bodies back into balance that tumor will go away and those cells will return. I have a deep belief in that. I have seen it. It takes a great discipline and a belief. But I think if there is someone who believes that says, ‘Yes, I can do this than they absolutely can do it.’ 

But shifting paradigms, whether health-related or otherwise, is nothing new to Etheridge, the accidental activist. 

“I am a gay person, I am married to a woman, and I have four children and we are living our life. I am a cannabis user, as my wife is, and this household is open to that, that’s our medicine, that’s our choice of relaxation in the evening. That’s our way of life. I love this country and that I have the freedom to do that.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Las Vegas lost one of its most celebrated luminaries last month with the passing of rock ‘n’ roll chef Kerry Simon. Exalted by foodies of varying palates -- from five-star dining connoisseurs to junk food lovers -- Kerry brought many a much ballyhooed culinary twist to a city that loved him as much as he did it. Who else could, in one fell swoop, redeem cotton candy from its low-rent position as a circus side show along with convenience store staples Rice Crispy treats and Ding Dongs into an indulgent platter fit for white-tablecloth dining?

The same kind-spirited soul who pioneered so many innovations on the culinary landscape also steered our attention to, and familiarized us with, Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) upon his diagnosis. In turn, we had a front seat to Kerry’s courageous battle as he used his celebrity status to fundraise and draw attention to the obscure neurological disorder.

His efforts led to a Global MSA Research Roadmap Conference which was held at the city’s Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health/Cleveland Clinic last November. It was through Kerry’s influence that key medical leaders from four continents, 12 countries, 30 academic institutions, and 15 pharmaceutical companies came to Las Vegas to share MSA research. He also shared the story of his experience with MSA in the inaugural issue of this magazine earlier this year, of which, we will be eternally grateful.

Even though Kerry is gone, the work he began continues. His advocacy and fundraising efforts created a clinic dedicated to MSA at the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health which is focused on the continued study of the disease while also providing treatment for MSA sufferers. 

Later this month, the Keep Memory Alive Center at Downtown’s Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health will host a celebration of Kerry’s life. The private event will feature celebrity chefs making Kerry’s most well-loved dishes, pajama-clad servers in ode to his popular brunch at Simon, and bands playing his favorite music -- a bash truly befitting of a rock ‘n’ roll chef.

*Please remember that when cooking with medicinal cannabis you are cooking with a drug and the amounts of the drug and portions of the food ingested should always be taken into consideration. Always start out with small portions or doses and wait 30 minutes to an hour before eating any additional portions of food prepared with medical marijuana.

		<title>HEALING: the power of Medicinal Cannabis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For years I struggled with chronic headaches that caused sleepless nights, depression and hormone imbalances due to anxiety and stress caused by my job and a difficult family situation. Therapy, acupuncture, holistic, over-the-counter and prescription medications all helped control the pain and side effects but I was convinced there wasn’t a cure. I accepted that they were a part of my life.

While on a vacation to one of those “high states,” my husband begged and pleaded with me to try marijuana-infused edibles. “No, no, no, no, no, no!” I adamantly resisted. 

After growing up in a liberal town where pot was pretty accessible (even in the ’80s & ’90s) and going to college where pot was the only illegal drug to which I was ever exposed, I took great pride in my “pot-free” status (even my parents claimed they had never tried it) and intended to keep it that way. 

That was until later that afternoon when the stress of travel, the altitude and the heat had coalesced into a debilitating headache. Headaches disrupting otherwise terrific experiences had become the rule, not the exception and I didn’t want to let it ruin this day too. So, with tears in my eyes, I asked my husband to take me to a dispensary -- I was willing to give it a try. He nearly cried, he was so relieved. 

My eyes were opened to an unexpected sight. Instead of a dark, smoked-filled room, the dispensary was clean, bright and organized. Nervously my husband told the well-dressed young man behind the counter about my anxiety-induced headaches and my trepidation of trying edibles. He was witty and kind, recommended the lowest dose edibles they offered (10 mg) and suggested that I start with just half (5 mg). But that was only the first step.

It took nearly an hour for me to find the courage to actually eat the candy. Within 15 minutes my headache was gone—not dulled, not tolerable—GONE. Even better, I wasn’t acting like a wasted stoner as I had anticipated. I was a pain-free, functional adult. There was still one minor problem: I had to apologize to my husband for being so stubborn.

More than a year later I still have headaches, but I manage them much better. They don’t interfere with my daily activities the way they had in the past. At the first sign, I eat half of a Gummy candy and within 15 minutes the pain is gone. More importantly, I can control the headaches early on and keep them at bay for days, even weeks at a time. 

(By the way, I even told my parents).

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Tracy Dean has never been fond of conventional medicine. So when the 45-year-old was diagnosed with breast cancer two years ago, the path to a plethora of pharmaceutical prescriptions was an inevitable future. Or was it? 

“I’ve always been pretty holistic, so it was very hard for me to trust the whole system, but I did,” she says. “I had to do six rounds of chemotherapy. I had an aggressive type of cancer called HER2/neu-positive. Basically what that means is it’s a small mass, but it grows at a very fast rate. Had it been found when I was 10 years younger there would not have been a cure for it because the FDA didn’t approve a drug that I was able to get now called Herceptin.” 

For treatment and pain management, Dean says she was prescribed everything from antidepressants to Percocet, Oxycodone, Valium, Xanax and more. “I don’t want to call it like a factory, it’s just I don’t know how else to explain it. If you talk to 50 girls, we are all on the same things.” 

That rote approach of taking pill after pill to treat the side effects of chemotherapy didn’t sit well with Dean. “Chemotherapy is like the worst hangover, the worst jet lag and the worst food poisoning all at the same time. And you have 18 bottles of prescriptions to try to mask all that stuff, on top of the poison that’s already in you! I knew chemotherapy was key to my treatment but the pill regimen -- I was a big fan of not doing that.”

 It was a friend from Colorado who suggested Dean try medicinal marijuana edibles, that come in the form of gummy candy, rather than use pharmaceuticals to deal with her pain and the effects of chemotherapy.

Dean had tried cannabis recreationally many years ago but didn’t enjoy it. “I tried it, but wasn’t a fan. It burned my throat and I didn’t like that. So I knew there was no way I was going to smoke it.

“It took me three weeks to get up the courage to take them [the gummies]. I was scared. It’s funny that I was more afraid of the holistic than the poison they were giving me. But I was constipated, I had had the mastectomy, I was doing chemotherapy -- everything hurt. I couldn’t eat, I had lost a lot of weight so I finally decided to try them. It was amazing! The candy would help me very much relax and go to sleep, take the edge off any kind of nausea.” 

In fact, the edibles were so relaxing that Dean had the tendency to forget about some of the challenges associated with breast cancer. “I remember when I first started eating edibles, watching an infomercial late one night about hot rollers and I thought I have to have those hot rollers. It wasn’t until I stood up to get my credit card that I passed a mirror and remembered I was bald now and couldn’t order hot rollers for hair that I didn’t even have,” Dean recalls with a hearty laugh. 

“I was so not in pain and relaxed and it was a great feeling. I remember thinking I love these things,” Dean says of the gummy edibles she used for six months during the worst of the chemotherapy.  “I would wake up and not be groggy. It’s very hard when you are in a pain pill funk. That is one of the very big positives about medicinal marijuana is I could function that next day and not be in a cloud.” 

When Dean initially started her treatment, she opted for a unilateral mastectomy. But this past summer she made the personal choice not to expose herself to more risk and had a prophylactic mastectomy, in turn, dropping the return rate of her breast cancer to four percent. What have also dropped are the prescriptions thanks to a daily regimen of the cannabinoid CBD. 

“A very dear friend of mine is the owner of a company called CannaVest. He immediately sent me a very generous package of something called CBD, which I had never heard of before,” Dean explains. “Straight CBD feels like you have taken an Ibuprofren 800. It almost feels like an anti-inflammatory. I take capsules to go to sleep at night and I have a spray I put under my tongue. 

“I can go an entire day without feeling stoned. I already have chemo brain so I couldn’t be stoned with chemo brain, too,” she says, laughing. “[I use CBD] if I have pain and it takes away stress. I do things to get my body strong again like exercising and it takes away the soreness.

“I can’t imagine that I didn’t have [CBD oil] from the beginning. Besides the medicine that I needed for treatment—not the additional medicine they prescribed—it got me through everything.” From CBD’s anti-inflammatory properties to battling pain, Dean has found relief from stress and anxiety-related insomnia as well. 

“Sleeping pills are pretty brutal because it’s hard to wake up the next day. I take about a 25mg capsule of CBD oil. I weigh about 120 pounds and it just takes that edge off,” she explains. “Ibuprofen 800s are extremely hard on the stomach, they’re not good for you. I’ve replaced them completely, and am not taking the Ibuprofen anymore. My last surgery was three weeks ago and besides the morphine button in the hospital, I went home and just used CBD!” 

Dean splits her time between Las Vegas and Laguna Beach, where she chose to be treated at UCLA and Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian. “I have a studio on the ocean in Laguna, so it was easier for me to heal here than Las Vegas because I didn’t drive a lot,” she says. 

To keep friends and family up-to-date on her recovery and progress, Dean started a Facebook page called ‘Team Tracy D.’ “I do as much as I can for the cancer world and I share my story and journey with as many people as I can help,” she explains. She’s also helping others with her Tracy Dean Skincare, which is 100 percent pure virgin coconut oil. Ten percent of proceeds are donated to cancer research. 

“As far as I am concerned I am good,” Dean says with regard to her prognosis. 

“Now I am an advocate for all of it. I just wish there was more education. I believe in [cannabis] so much and so many people haven’t heard of alternate treatments. Health insurance doesn’t pay for this stuff, and it just sucks. The fact that you can’t get it [cannabis] legally or that it’s not covered by your insurance, but you can get oxy for $4 -- that is very weird to me,” Dean says. 

“Ninety percent of oncologists will not even listen to anything holistic, anything to do with marijuana. I’m sure they will jump on the bandwagon as it gets popular, but the fact that it has to become popular to do what’s best for the patient, not the money-making field that they’re in, would be a blessing. 

“I’m hooked on trying to be as healthy as possible,” Dean relays. “My hair is growing back now. I swim, I paddleboard, I walk. I just try to live my life as healthy and calmly as I can. I have an addictive personality, so I love the benefits of CBD—I love the marijuana, too. The edibles were fantastic and amazing for cancer patients. I’d recommend it 1000 percent.”

		<title>Crazy Girls Turned Cannabis Advocate</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Shellee Renee was one of the original, world-famous “Crazy Girls” who performed nightly to adoring audiences at the recently shuttered Riviera Hotel & Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. 

“Back then I did a lot. I would be a spokes-model at conventions from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. then go to the showroom, take a little nap and then do three shows. I always did extra stuff -- acting, modeling, commercials, and movies.”

After showcasing her more statuesque assets from 1990 to 1996, Renee decided it was time to plan for a future without the “Crazy Girls” and earned a degree in Communication at the UNLV graduating in 2005. 

“I was asked, ‘What would you do if you weren’t in the show?’ I would go to college and get a degree in public relations. I earned my B.A. of Communication. It’s one of the best things I’ve done with my life. I have no regrets about anything, but the degree has served me very well. It’s one of the things that I’m very proud of. I’m the first one of my family to graduate college.” 

Putting her degree to use, for the next seven years Renee concentrated on a career in public relations working for some of the city’s biggest communications companies including R&R Partners, MGM Resorts International and Charlie Palmer Group.

Then life threw a curveball as it often does. A family illness caused her to rethink the trajectory of her life in Las Vegas. 

Her mother was diagnosed with colon cancer in 2008 and took two rounds of chemotherapy treatment, only to die of brain cancer in 2010. Renee went back home to the Pacific Northwest to be closer to her father and sister. 

“I was devastated by my mother’s passing from brain cancer so I moved from Las Vegas to Portland to reconnect with my remaining family in June of 2012,” Renee explains of re-shifting her priorities and ensuing decision to move back home. 

In a strange twist, right before she relocated her life to Portland, Renee discovered she, too, had cancer – for the second time. 

“I had everything packed up to move to Portland and I got the news two days before the move,” recalls Renee of her 2012 diagnosis. She had a lumpectomy in the same spot in 2009 but opted not to do any radiation or follow-up. 

“I was really in work mode,” she says of her first bout with breast cancer. “I had the lumpectomy and didn’t think it was necessary to devote the time to daily radiation treatments.”

When her breast cancer came back in 2012 it was much larger. “It was two centimeters originally (2009) and when it came back a second time, it was about six centimeters. My reaction when I found out was: ‘what have I done?’ because I should have had the radiation the first time.”

Renee continued to Portland and spent another month finding a doctor to perform the surgery. The cancer grew to ten centimeters and spread into her lymph nodes requiring a mastectomy and six months of chemotherapy, followed by six weeks of radiation. 

In September 2012 when Renee began chemotherapy she also began taking a regimen of pain and anti-nausea pills. The pills, however, did not work. To combat the joint pain and nausea she felt on a regular basis resulting from the chemotherapy treatments, she turned to medicinal cannabis for relief. 

“Although I’ve never been a fan of smoking, I had heard that marijuana helps with nausea. With the first inhale, I immediately felt my nausea dissipating,” she explains of her decision to ease the side effects of chemotherapy with cannabis.

“[The doctor] had given me anti-nausea medication and it wasn’t working. I was so nauseous that one of my neighbors said, ‘try smoking this – it will make you feel better.’ I noticed then that I went from feeling really sick to feeling really great. It surprised me, too, because I had smoked it recreationally in my teen years but I had no idea how effective it was for pain and nausea.”

Growing up in the Pacific Northwest she was raised to lean more towards natural remedies for ailments and not immediately turn to prescriptions and over-the-counter medications so using medicinal cannabis was not that much of a stretch for Renee.

“My grandparents raised all of our chickens and cows. We had a garden; we just did everything naturally. We went to the co-op and my family was into organic, basically homegrown everything -- I mean, I’ve plucked chickens.”

Renee made a point to be up front with her doctors about the fact that she was using marijuana to help with her pain and nausea. While medical marijuana was legal in Portland, they warned her against smoking of any kind because it would inhibit her healing. 

She then turned to cannabutter (cannabis-infused butter) to alleviate her suffering. She would spread cannabutter on her toast every morning to help lessen her nausea and discomfort. 

“When I was in Portland and since I didn’t really like to smoke, the medical cannabis grower gave me cannabutter to try. I would just get up in the morning put a little butter on my toast and it would be not so much like a high but your body would just feel good. I would walk around work for eight hours and be fine.” 

At the end of her radiation treatments Renee used cannabis as well because, “the radiation burns became more painful with each treatment.”

	Although Renee finished her cancer treatment in April 2013, she is in the process of breast reconstruction and so is, again, using cannabutter as well as drops to help with the pain. 

“Drops I discovered when my mom was suffering with cancer, she had already gone through surgery and a full round of chemo, but the cancer came back, and she had to take another six-week treatment. I talked to a friend about my mother, telling them that she would not smoke anything. They said they could get drops from the dispensary. You just put 10-12 drops under your tongue, you don’t have to eat or smoke and it makes you feel better. It’s kind of the same thing as the butter; it doesn’t get you high, it just makes the body feel good. The drops have kind of an alcohol taste.”

Renee is passionate about recommending medicinal cannabis to others. “The side effects of chemo are absolute nausea where you feel like you could throw up at any minute. To be able to quell that in two puffs or two drops or with a pat of butter is amazing. It helps you mentally, with the anxiety that accompanies illness, as well. I do recommend it to people. Most definitely, I recommend it all the time.”

However, not everyone is open-minded to the benefits of medicinal cannabis. Throughout her treatments Renee encountered a lot of naysayers. So many so that she is “fed up with the ‘stoner’ mentality” and the stereotype that accompanies marijuana users. 

“I believed that stereotype too, then I found from personal experience that cannabis has amazing medicinal properties that really help alleviate suffering.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Melissa Etheridge’s passion for the health benefits of cannabis inspired her to create her own line of cannabis-infused wine called Know Label. 

Although it sounds innovative, combining cannabis and wine is nothing new. According to Smithsonian.com, a personal wine cellar in a Canaanite palace in modern day northern Israel was discovered in 2013. Dating back to 1600 B.C., it’s the oldest cellar that has ever been found, with approximately 528 gallons of wine infused with cinnamon, honey, mint and psychotropic resins.

“It’s an ancient art. They found wine casks from 2,000 years ago back in the days of Jesus that had cannabis and wine together. It just goes far back. Vineyards have been doing it on the side, without anyone knowing, forever,” explains Etheridge. 

Etheridge has joined forces with farmer-grower-vintner Lisa Molyneux of Santa Cruz dispensary Greenway to make cannabis-infused wine or tincture. “We have been making cases and cases of it and storing it until we figured out how we were going to sell it. We just found out this last month we can actually do it on a large level and we are gearing up to present it on a mass level.”

Because it contains no THC, Etheridge will be able to sell it as she would any wine. “It’s a cold extraction so there’s no THC in it, it’s just CBD. It’s like a Charlotte’s Web sort of thing and so I can actually sell it under any state law. It will be sold as a wine that is medicated in a sense. It’s not like an ingested medicine. It’s not like an edible, it’s a tincture,” explains Etheridge.

“It is actually for people who enjoy wine and the effects of wine but you can have that relaxed feeling with one glass of this wine where you might need three glasses of another wine and you will not have a hangover. You will feel better, the medicinal part of it relaxes your nervous system and body without the THC high. So it’s actually a wonderful product for people who want sort of the stress relief without the euphoric high. It’s really good stuff.”

Etheridge originally called her cannawine No Label for practical purposes. “When we were making the bottles we couldn’t afford labels so I said we are going to call it No Label wine. And we actually found out there is something else called No Label so now we are calling it Know Label,” Etheridge says noting the double entendre with a knowing smile.

<h2>CALIFORNIA</h2>
<p>In mid-September California lawmakers passed the state’s most significant medical-marijuana legislation in almost two decades. The legislation paves the way for a regulatory framework for the state’s multibillion-dollar medical cannabis industry. The California Senate and Assembly voted to approve the historic Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act, which will require licenses for cannabis dispensaries and create a new state agency, called the Bureau of Medical Marijuana Regulation, to oversee the industry. Although California residents voted to approve medical marijuana in 1996, a regulatory plan has eluded policymakers until now. Legislators finally reached a compromise on three bills, which have been sent for final approval to Gov. Jerry Brown, who is expected to sign them into law. </p>

<h2>OHIO</h2> 
<p>On November 3, Ohio voters will have the chance to decide whether marijuana should be legalized for both medicinal and recreational use. The Marijuana Legalization Amendment would allow adults 21 and over to purchase marijuana for medicinal or recreational use and to grow four plants for personal use. The ballot measure sets up a network of 10 authorized growing locations around the state and lays out regulatory and taxation guidelines for cannabis. Should the ballot measure pass, it would make Ohio a rare state to legalize, in a single vote, marijuana for both medicinal and recreational use.</p>

 <h2>COLORADO</h2>
<p>For the first time in history, a state has generated more annual revenue from taxes imposed on marijuana than from taxes imposed on alcohol. According to the Colorado Department of Revenue, the state collected nearly $70 million in marijuana-specific taxes and just under $42 million in alcohol-specific taxes from July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015, the Marijuana Policy Project based in Washington, D.C., reported. Marijuana tax revenues jumped from $25 million in the first five months of 2014 to $44 million in the first five months of this year. </p>

During its first week, Euphoria had six strains available to patient cardholders: Kosher Kush, Strawberry Cough, Blue Dream, RKS, Cheese, and San Fernando Valley. Euphoria is not the first dispensary to open in Nevada. Silver State Relief, located in Sparks, Nevada, claimed that distinction, opening July 31st.  </p>

<h2>NEW YORK</h2> 
New York City’s first medical marijuana dispensary will open in January 2016. The dispensary located on 14th Street between Second and Third Avenues will be operated by Columbia Care, one of five companies awarded licenses by the state in July to open medical marijuana shops. The other four licensees include Bloomfield Industries, Empire State Health Solutions, Etain, and Pharmacannis. Each license allows for the operation of one manufacturing facility and four dispensaries, all of which must be based in New York State. New York’s  medical marijuana laws only allow for liquid and oil preparations.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With the medical marijuana industry budding in Nevada, Congresswoman Dina Titus of Nevada’s 1st District spoke in support of recreational marijuana use at a University of Nevada Las Vegas press conference in mid-September.

 “I haven’t really come out in favor for recreational or adult use of marijuana, but I think it’s something that the voters will decide here in Nevada,” said Titus of the Nevada Marijuana Legalization Initiative which will be on the ballot in November 2016.

Last time Nevada voters got to decide was in 2000 when they voted to legalize medical marijuana use. In 2013, the state legislature passed an enacting statute to build the regulatory framework. In recent months, the valley has watched as many medical cannabis dispensaries have begun preparations to open their doors for the first time.

“I think it will pass,” said Titus, who is part of a Congressional cannabis working group, of the 2016 ballot initiative. “If it does, again, I will be supportive 
of doctors, patients and businesses in the state.”

Her continued support has induced her co-sponsorship of a number of bills dealing with medical marijuana and marijuana rights.

As a ranking member of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Committee, Titus co-sponsored the Veterans Equal Access Act. Introduced in February, this bill would allow the VA to educate veterans about the use of medical cannabis for pain treatment and post-traumatic stress disorder.

In April, Titus announced the introduction of the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act to protect individuals and businesses from federal prosecution of drug crimes in states where marijuana use, medical or recreational, is legal.

On Nov. 8, 2016, the Nevada Marijuana Legalization Initiative will be on the ballot as an indirect initiated state statute. 

Upon voter approval, this measure would legalize the possession of one ounce or less of marijuana for recreational use and the taxation and regulation of marijuana for adults at least 21 years old.

Titus believes legalizing recreational marijuana use in Nevada would boost the economy and be effective in achieving criminal justice reform.
“I say, puff, puff, pass the bill,” said Titus.

		<title>Delivery is Meant for Pizza not Cannabis</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Across the nation, many individuals pick up the phone to order cannabis to be delivered to their home, just like when they order a pizza. However, a staggering number of those cannabis deliveries are illegal. In Nevada, patients have relied on and utilized delivery services to obtain their medicine for years. However, cannabis delivery services – places that only deliver – are illegal in Nevada. Only state licensed dispensaries, and only in limited situations, may deliver cannabis to patients. 
The distinction of who can legally deliver and what is an illegal delivery service may seem trivial, but it is of vital importance. If a patient utilizes an illegal delivery service, the patient is committing a crime. Law enforcement has been busting illegal delivery services and patients utilizing those services. Patients have been arrested and held due to use of illegal delivery services. 

Therefore, let’s break down what is allowed under Nevada law. If you visited well-known cannabis websites such as Weedmaps.com or Leafly.com today you would see that anywhere from 15 to over 20 “delivery-only” dispensaries are listed as serving patients in the Las Vegas area. Some of these places even claim to serve out-of-state patients. 

Some of the “delivery-only” places have professional looking websites leading a patient to believe they are legitimate. Much as if I were utilizing a coupon on Dominos.com, I could utilize the “Deal of the Day” coupon at Weedmaps.com to receive 2 grams of top-shelf flower for only $30 at one shop. Even a simple Google search tends to suggest delivery-only shops are legitimate. I can do a Google search for pizza delivery and am led to places like Dominos or Pizza Hut and when I Google cannabis delivery I get listings for Weedmaps, Leafly and Where’s Weed. 

Therefore, many innocent patients believe these to be legitimate businesses. The issue is that the websites that list these delivery-only services take no responsibility for the illegal action they are facilitating. Yes, they are aware that delivery-only is illegal in Nevada but they continue to list them. Therefore, patients unknowingly utilize these services. 

To be clear – the only place to legally obtain medicine in the State of Nevada is to purchase it from a state licensed dispensary or to grow it in your own home.

So how would a patient be able to tell if a business is a state licensed facility or an illegal delivery service? 
 
First, look for the state license. State licensed dispensaries are required to have their license hanging in the waiting area of the dispensary. 

 Second, look at the website listings. A listing that advertises “delivery-only” is not a state licensed facility as the state licensed facilities are required to have a brick and mortar facility to service patients. 

 Third, ask to see an employee’s state issued agent registration card. If an employee is working in a state licensed facility, even on a delivery to a patient, they will have an agent registration card issued from the State of Nevada that permits them to work in a state licensed facility. 

Tonight when you pick up the phone, do not hesitate to order a pizza for delivery. However, if cannabis delivery is what you need, be cautious. Locate a state licensed dispensary and see if they are able to deliver to you. A call to a cannabis delivery service could very well lead to you calling someone to post your bail.

		<title>Evergreen Organix Cultivates Homemade Taste Into Every Edible they Make</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[With a product line that runs the gamut from chocolate squares, French-made macaroons and double chocolate brownies to cranberry oatmeal cookies, Gummy candy, and vegan sugar-free GMO bars, Evergreen Organix Cultivation and Production is the Willy Wonka of Nevada’s medicinal cannabis space.

But Evergreen Organix Cultivation and Production is offering much more than just the tastiest edibles in the marketplace. They are doing it in one of the most sterile environments in the industry. “We are trying to set a standard of quality and cleanliness that will translate into safety for the patients,” explains Kurt Barrick, master grower for Evergreen Organix Cultivation and Production. 

That strict adherence to safety translates into Evergreen Organix cultivation employees showering upon their arrival to the facility and then donning a decontamination uniform. Should an employee leave, they will have to go through the cleaning process again upon their return. 
“We put them in a quarantine type of situation before they are even allowed to come out on the floor so it’s a very, very extremely clean product,” explains Barrick. “You go to Washington, Colorado, California, Oregon, and Arizona and they are buying product that’s been grown outdoors or is from greenhouses so the difference with Evergreen is we produce our own product. The cleaner the product we start with the better the quality and cleanliness of the product you end up with especially on the extraction side. Everything is cleaned, controlled and sterile which is very critical to the end product.”

The secondary benefit of such a controlled environment is a lot of pesticides don’t have to be applied. “We don’t even have to apply organic pesticides or fungicides. We run a sterile-free zone and we don’t spray our plants. The anti-microbial, sterilization and cleaning we do helps us to reduce any pesticide and fungicide use,” says Barrick.

Evergreen also doesn’t use preservatives in its product. “One of the keys to keeping the product fresh is we use a blast freeze that retains all the taste and allows us to hold the product longer,” says Barrick. 

Equally important to Evergreen’s line of edibles is taste. The company has hired three chefs who each possess their own distinctive set of skills for creating edibles in Evergreen’s 4,000-square-foot kitchen. One specializes in French pastries, another is skilled in crafting sugar-, gluten-, and GMO-free confections, and the third has a medical background and will produce vegan, gluten- and GMO-free masterpieces.

“We did lots of taste tests with each chef to make sure we were confidant in the product they could make. The infusion isn’t really difficult -- that’s the really easy part,” explains Barrick. “The more complicated part is getting that homemade taste into the edibles, which is really important to us and the product we are creating.”

		<title>Zem Media Offers Dispensaries Control of Guest Experience</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the biggest challenges dispensaries will face is managing an ever-changing supply of medicinal cannabis strains. More challenging yet, will be keeping patients up-to-date with what strains are available at the dispensary and the various conditions and diseases they treat.  

Digital signage is an effective option dispensaries are using to display inventory while saving on paper costs to maintain an environmentally friendly approach. “Our digital signage product is user friendly, scalable and gives our customers everything they need to take control of their digital marketing to enhance the guest experience at their dispensary,” explains Bill Connell, Vice President, Sales & Marketing, of digital media signage company Zem Media.  

“At the heart of the system is how easy it is to make changes to the signage on a daily basis. Each client has their own portal, a content management system, on our server that can be accessed through any internet connection. No special workstation is required to manage your signs. It puts the owners in full control of their medium,” 
says Bill of the electric signs. 

<img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/zem-media-signs-300x168.jpg" alt="Zem Media Digital Signage" width="300" height="168" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1902" />

Zem Media is currently working with 14 Las Vegas-based dispensaries on their signage needs. Using Zemplates, which are preset formats of signs in varying configurations and sizes, the dispensary is able to create signage unique for their establishment. The digital marketing company has numerous Zemplates available for their dispensary customers to choose from based on their needs and wants. Additionally, custom Zemplates can be created.  

Programming Zem Media digital signage is simple -- clients just upload, drag, drop, and display. Changing the signage is easy too. Zem Media clients can go into their system and change a product’s price with the click of a button and upload the change simultaneously to one screen or 1,000. 

Dispensaries can also stream video and play You Tube videos on Zem Media’s digital signage. “They can stream as many videos as they want. Their imagination is their limitation,” says Bill. “We just implemented signage at one dispensary that had 10 screens with a different message on each one and they were all constantly changing.”
 
The overall experience for the dispensary patient is further enhanced by Zem Media’s digital signage as the perceived wait time (the time a person believes they are waiting in line) is typically reduced by 40 to 60 percent. Bill further describes the ancillary benefits the signs have for the dispensary patients, explaining that “our signs can educate customers before they get in the purchase room so they know what particular strain can affect which particular illness. It’s almost like having extra employees by reducing the amount of questions the customer has to ask the employees about what each strain does.” 

Bill sums it up, “The better the patient is educated, the better the experience.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Photographer Hector Leyva, owner of Sugar Mill Studios, can relate to the freshly minted founders of Nevada’s medicinal marijuana establishments (MMEs). He, too, left a good corporate job to follow a dream that had its risks.
 
“I quit a corporate job and was done with corporate life. I wanted to figure out what I wanted to do and I did,” says Leyva of making a career change to become a professional photographer.

Leyva’s career transition came as a result of his hobby building lowrider cars. “My cars always got featured in magazines like Lowrider and so they were photographed a lot. One of my friends, and now a mentor, Saul Vargas, showed me a picture he took of one of my cars then he made me move my car a half-foot and it changed the shot like night and day. I thought to myself, I need to learn how to do that because look how something so minimal made such a huge difference.”

A professional photographer for the last six years, Leyva started dabbling and “one thing led to another and next thing I know people are paying me to take pictures. My first paying gig was a family portrait,” explains Leyva. “I really love to photograph people but rarely do they like getting their picture taken. They don’t really look forward to it. Especially guys, they are the worst. I am really good with babies and kids, they are a big part of my work. You gotta be able to have that interaction with people that makes them feel comfortable.”

Leyva’s subjects are diverse -- shooting everything from real estate to medicinal marijuana. “I do a lot of automotive photography,” says Leyva, though noting that “the diversity of my pictures is what I love. Today was real estate, 
I am scheduled to do a model in a little bit, and tomorrow morning is a baby.”

The Los Angeles native has also worked in the medicinal marijuana industry taking food shots for The Happy Chef THC’s cookbook as well as doing work for Travel Joint, a few labs, and product shots of medicinal marijuana. But it’s the people behind the industry he is most excited to photograph. 

“It’s the leaders, the doctors, the people behind the scenes -- that’s who I would like to capture. The normal, everyday professionals who are starting these businesses and are at the forefront of the movement are the most fascinating to me.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>EUPHORIA WELLNESS</h2>
<a href="http://www.euphoriawellnessnv.com" title="Visit Las Vegas Releaf Website" target="_blank">euphoriawellnessnv.com </a>
Wellness. Professional. Compassionate. Clean. Patients. Those five words instantly come to mind for Euphoria Wellness’ Managing Director Darlene Purdy when asked to describe the Las Vegas Valley’s first dispensary to open its doors. 

With healing, education, and safety in mind, Euphoria strives to be the first stop for patients on the road to wellness by offering patients one-on-one treatment, according to Purdy. The Euphoria Wellness experience starts the second the patient walks into the dispensary and is welcomed by its highly trained staff. No matter how long a patient has been medicating, Euphoria’s wellness guides will lead each patient from beginning to end with knowledge and advice. 

Not only do Euphoria’s wellness guides educate patients on strains and the various products they carry, but the dispensary also provides laboratory test results in order to find the best possible medication. With each visit, patients will better understand their needs. 

In order to target patients as individuals rather than a general population, Euphoria keeps a wide variety of product on hand, from JUJU joint vaporizers to pre-rolls and concentrates. By the turn of the year, Euphoria’s own cultivation and production center will be complete. With the completion, Euphoria will expand its inventory by adding edibles and Nevada-tested topical creams. The dispensary also hopes to offer more strains such as Kosher Kush, Tahoe OG, Gurl Scout Cookie and Bob Marley on top of their existing strains, which include Chem 91, Platinum Blue Dream, Poprox, and RKS. 

While Euphoria promises every patient a one-on-one experience, it also guarantees safety and security throughout their entire visit. Euphoria claims to provide the highest level of security in the industry, with security escorts offered to every patient. “We’re excited to be able to serve patients in the valley and we can’t wait for our cultivation to open so we can provide our own medicine,” said Purdy.

<h2>INYO FINE CANNABIS DISPENSARY</h2>
<a href="http://www.inyolasvegas.com" title="Visit Inyo's Website" target="_blank">inyolasvegas.com</a>
Managing partners David Goldwater and Chris Olsen, along with Director of Education Greta Carter, take pride in their passion for excellence at Inyo Fine Cannabis Dispensary. Inyo Fine looks at its partnership with the state of Nevada and its patients as a privilege, and through that responsibility they are motivated to dispel the deep-seeded stigma associated with marijuana, according to Carter. 

Carter is putting education and research at the forefront of the dispensary’s mission. “We look at the test results and see what makes a certain strain effective for a particular illness or condition,” she explained. 

The research, however, does not end there for Carter and Inyo Fine’s staff. When patients enter Inyo Fine Cannabis Dispensary, an educational center is made available to them, complete with books specific to medicinal cannabis and an open computer station for further research. With these tools, Inyo Fine hopes to build a level of trust and comfort with their patients. 

Inyo Fine takes advantage of the detailed research conducted in Nevada when training its staff, and encourages the team to deliver the same quality education to each patient. But Inyo Fine’s mission is not married to education and research alone. They put a lot of effort into creating an inviting, patient-friendly, safe, and accessible atmosphere. 

In the coming months, Inyo Fine’s own cultivation and processing center will open. By then, they hope to have up to 30 different purely organic strains on hand at out-the-door prices, including Strawberry Cough, Fire Alien Kush, Lavender, Afterlife OG, LA Confidential and Enzo Kush. Patients can also look out for edibles, topicals, tinctures, concentrates and oils. 

As the cannabis market develops, Inyo Fine will keep patients updated through mobile phone updates, which patients can set up online through their website. “It is a privilege to be here and a lot of eyes are on us as the market evolves,” Carter noted. 

<h2>LAS VEGAS RELEAF</h2>
<a href="http://www.lasveagsreleaf.com" title="Visit Las Vegas Releaf Website" target="_blank">lasvegasreleaf.com</a>

Making compassion and knowledge the core of its mission, Las Vegas ReLeaf is described by CEO, Edward Bernstein, as “the best in the country.” Bernstein characterized the newly opened dispensary as the best, in part, because of the thoughtful approach the dispensary has taken with regard to patient safety and education. 

For instance, ReLeaf provides its customers with safe and legal medication by sending new users home with first-time patient kits to ensure a safe experience from beginning to end. To educate patients, the dispensary provides self-guided, interactive educational features available both online and through its mobile app. Patients can also take advantage of ReLeaf’s onsite budtenders, who are well-versed on the dispensary’s product.

Offering a wide range of products, ReLeaf, which is centrally located near the Strip, and stands within 1,000 feet of 12 bus stops and the Las Vegas Monorail, has sativa, indica, hybrids and a range of CBD-based topical creams and lotions. As the market evolves, the dispensary also plans to carry edibles and concentrates. By March, Las Vegas ReLeaf hopes to bring in strains such as Fire Alien Kush, Purple Haze, Enzo Kush, Sage N Sour, Pure Sunshine, Strawberry Cough, Gorilla Glue #4, and Train Wreck from its own cultivation.

“We’re really accessible, responsible, professional, and we put patients first,” Bernstein said of ReLeaf’s owners, a combination of doctors, attorneys and businesspeople who, Bernstein, acknowledged “bring a balance of responsible management that’s hard to replicate.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Veterans are finding that seeking treatment for PTSD is a harder proposition than being on the battlefield. Cannabis might be the answer, but we won’t know until more research is conducted. Dr. Sue Sisley has a federal grant, federally grown plant and the approval of the FDA so why can’t she get her study of the efficacy of cannabis on PTSD done?
by Beth Schwartz

Let’s start with the facts, well, as best we know them. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) estimates 22 veterans commit suicide every day from the effects of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder). And, sadly, that startling number is most probably higher since death certificates from only 21 states were analyzed in the VA’s 2012 Suicide Data Report conducted from 1999 to 2011.

“Twenty-two a day is a horrific number and a true public health crisis. That was shocking to everyone. Nobody knew that it was of that magnitude and, sadly, that was a low estimate. Under half of all the states reported, and some of the big states like California and Texas were left out, and so there’s a lot of missing data. It is just sickening to me that our federal government has not made this a top priority and that a study like ours would not be expedited given the epidemic of veteran suicide in this country.” Enter Dr. Sue Sisley. 

In fact, when Dr. Sisley does enter a room it’s akin to a rock star making a public appearance. Her admirers stand in line – almost in awe – to have just a second to shower her with gratitude and accolades. She takes it all in stride, receiving her enthusiastic public like a pontiff. And she might as well be a pontiff in the eyes of the military’s PTSD sufferers.

Reasons for the awe and appreciation vary. It could be because she is the first scientist with the gravitas to get a federal grant and plant to study the efficacy of cannabis on PTSD; it could be because the lifelong Republican was fired from her University of Arizona professorship in 2014 due to her pursuit of the study; or it could be that she not only has the potential to help a lot of veterans suffering from PTSD, but her study could save countless lives. 

When Dr. Sisley does consider all of the lives that could have been saved -- from the time she received approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to pursue her study in 2011 until now -- she is incredulous. She wonders aloud if marijuana could have helped curb this epidemic.

Maybe so. 

Dr. Sisley is principal investigator over the Arizona site for the only FDA-approved randomized controlled trial looking at the use of whole-plant marijuana, grown by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), in combat veterans with treatment-resistant PTSD. Her study will measure the effects of four different strains of smoked marijuana in treating symptoms of PTSD in 76 veterans ussing cannabis with a ratio of 7% CBD to 7% THC. 

Sisley had asked the government-run cannabis farm in Mississippi for plant with a ratio of 12% THC vs. 12% CBD but they grew 7%. “It is not close to what we asked for but we didn’t want to wait another grow cycle so we accepted it. It could be an ideal strain, but it’s not what we requested,” relays Sisley.

Giving her study additional credibility, private research university Johns Hopkins in Baltimore signed on to become a study partner in 2014 and will be splitting the protocol, enrolling 38 of the patients. “That will be a terrific opportunity because a multi-center trial is so much better when you are dealing with the FDA. For us to have two completely independent functioning sites collecting the data with similar results is very compelling,” notes Dr. Sisley. 

Even as she forges ahead with a $2.2-million-dollar grant from the Colorado Health Department to study cannabis, Dr. Sisley is not 100 percent sure cannabis is the cure-all many claim it to be. “I am not sold on this yet because there is still conflicting data. Ultimately, as scientists, we have to look at the data, but I am also a human being so I have to weigh that against this mountain of anecdotal evidence and these incredibly compelling and heart-wrenching stories from these vets and their families.” 

She continues, further making her point, “I am not a cheerleader for medical marijuana. I am not pro-marijuana, I am just pro-research. I am trying to enter the study objectively,” explains Dr. Sisley, who has never used marijuana personally. “I am not part of the industry; I don’t own dispensaries or co-own any grows. I am really just interested in the science. We owe it to these veterans to collect objective data on how this plant is performing in humans and not just in rats.”

In addition to treating patients, Dr. Sisley is a volunteer Medical Director for five dispensaries in Arizona. But her interest in studying if cannabis reduces the severity of PTSD came as a result of seeing what it did for vets, in spite of her own bias against cannabis.  

“It was just a gradual flood of reports over the last 10 years,” recalls Dr. Sisley of vets disclosing to her that they used cannabis to manage a variety of symptoms, not just PTSD. Admitting, “I was very judgmental. And I say ‘reluctantly disclosing to me’ because they knew how conservative I was, I am a lifelong Republican and have never used any street drugs and I don’t condone that with my patients. I think they understood I was going to be highly discouraging so they slowly began to persuade me that this plant must have some merit.

“Keep in mind, these were really credible historians, too. These vets who were talking to me came out of a really conservative background and had also never used drugs and some of them were even in DEA details and a lot of them were anti-drug. They were desperately seeking relief and had learned about cannabis from their fellow veterans and that was what impressed me. Many years ago veterans started teaching each other how to use this plant and how to save themselves because they realized they weren’t going to get help from me or the VA and that I wasn’t capable of providing the kind of relief they needed. All I have at my fingertips is FDA-approved meds and I can’t veer beyond that. They were the ones who finally enlightened me, it took them years, though, because I was so blocked.”

It wasn’t just the vets themselves who enlightened Dr. Sisley. The veterans’ ability to eschew most of their pharmaceutical prescriptions also played a role in changing her mind. 

“The veterans in my practice have walked away from most or all of their prescription drugs,” she reveals. “They have not visited a VA hospital in years and they are healthy. It’s astounding. They are using cannabis, in many cases, as a monotherapy to treat a myriad of illnesses and not just PTSD, but their TBI (traumatic brain injury), their chronic pain, all sorts of ailments. That’s why I am so fascinated by this plant because I am curious to see how is it that this single intervention is working.”

Curious because, the fact is, when vets return from active duty they aren’t finding a cure of any kind -- much less relief for anything from depression to night terrors.  

“Many of these vets come back from service and we end up putting them on the combat cocktail. We pummel them with all these prescription meds because we don’t know what else to do. Each target a symptom, whether it’s a headache or anxiety, and each is treated with a different prescription. So slowly, they snowball onto 12 or 15 different prescriptions in the course of their first year back and they feel completely useless. With all that polypharmacy, they just become non-functional. That’s what is so empowering about the plant, they realize there is a natural God-given remedy that seems to treat most of their symptoms.”

Dr. Sisley has spent over five years combating federal government red tape, the stigma of marijuana, and even being fired from her position as clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of Arizona to get this study off the ground. Which, of course, begs the question, at this point, is she a scientist or an activist?

“In the beginning I just wanted to study the plant. When we ran into these relentless barriers throughout this process it forced me to become an activist. The injustice of science being shackled by politics was so obvious that I just couldn’t walk away, especially with the weight of all these veterans on our shoulders, it was clear that we needed to push through,” Dr. Sisley explains. “Every waking moment when I am not taking care of patients, I am striving to get this study underway. I am gathering clinical experiences from patients in my various roles as medical director of these dispensaries. When I am not seeing patients, I am trying to move the needle and basically trying to build awareness about the barriers of marijuana advocacy research.”

But, at last, Dr. Sisley may finally be done clearing hurdles. She’s got the grant money, the plant from NIDA, and now it appears she has finally found a place to house her study. She had wanted to conduct the study on a university campus but both Arizona and Nevada begged off. Universities in both states were concerned for their federal funding, in spite of the fact that Dr. Sisley has lined up federal money, federally grown plant, and is being monitored by the FDA.

“Nothing nefarious or outside of the legal boundaries is taking place. It shows you that even in the face of real facts, of accurate information, these universities still run scared because nobody wants to stick their neck out for science especially when it comes to marijuana efficacy research,” Dr. Sisley contends.   

The Arizona portion of the study will be housed at a cannabis grow facility. “In the end we got zoned out of existence because the cities didn’t know what to do it with us. They zoned us worse than a dispensary. They zoned us as a marijuana use because of the fact we had smoking on the premises as part of the study protocol. So we ended up co-locating in a grow facility. It’s my least optimal solution because we are a federally legal study collocated in a federally illegal environment. I don’t want it to look like I am in bed with industry, but the restrictions made it impossible for us to be in an appropriate environment such as in a medical plaza so we ended up there.”

The study’s housing at the grow facility should be ready by the end of the year and Dr. Sisley is looking forward to enrolling the first veterans in January and starting to collect objective data. The study will take a minimum of two years so there won’t be any published data for 2-1/2 years. 

So in spite of Dr. Sisley’s heroic efforts, the public health crisis surrounding our veterans will continue unabated. It will be a few more years and many more lives lost before any definitive research will provide the answers necessary to end our veterans’ fight with the domestic terrorist that is PTSD.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After a traumatic event it is common to experience psychological distress. Most individuals recover from such an event without persistent psychological effects.  However, some people develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can lead to long-lasting aftereffects such as nightmares, hyper-arousal state, difficult memories, trouble sleeping or concentrating, anxiety, depression, flashbacks, and emotional detachment.<sup>[<a href="#references">1,2</a>]</sup>  

PTSD is even more prevalent among military personnel because of their participation in warzones. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) estimates that PTSD afflicts 31% of Vietnam veterans, 10% of Gulf War (Desert Storm) veterans, 11% of Afghanistan veterans, and 20% of Iraq veterans.<sup>[<a href="#references">3</a>]</sup>  

The consequences of PTSD on the individual, their families, and society can be overwhelming. PTSD places individuals at a higher risk for suicide, substance abuse, depression, and violence.4 The VA estimates that up to 22 former members of the Armed Forces commit suicide per day.<sup>[<a href="#references">5</a>]</sup> Furthermore, PTSD has been shown to lead to other health issues such as coronary heart disease, gastrointestinal symptoms, and higher overall mortality.<sup>[<a href="#references">6,7</a>]</sup>  

<h4>CURRENT PTSD TREATMENTS OFFER LIMITED SUCCESS</h4>
	Treatment for PTSD is limited and the success rate remains low. The mainstay of treatment options includes Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) such as Paxil and Zoloft. However, these medications have side effects such as weight gain, decreased libido, drowsiness, and nausea. Second-line pharmaceuticals include Effexor, Prazosin, Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, and tricyclic antidepressants, which tend to have more side effects. 

A recent review of psychotherapies for military-related PTSD showed suboptimal outcomes.<sup>[<a href="#references">8</a>]</sup> The most frequently utilized trauma-focused psychotherapies for military-related PTSD are Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) and Prolonged Exposure. Trauma-focused therapies are considered first line therapies, yet they are only marginally superior to non-trauma-focused therapies. A form of cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), trauma-focused therapy is a psychosocial treatment model that helps patients confront their beliefs, emotions, and memories associated with the traumatic event. Non-trauma-focused therapies, such as Present-Centered Therapy (PCT), concentrate on teaching coping skills; for example, stress management, problem-solving, and relaxation. PCT utilizes problem-solving techniques to focus on the patient’s existing skills to cope with stressors associated with PTSD.<sup>[<a href="#references">9</a>]</sup>  

<h4>THE TIDE TURNS TOWARD MEDICINAL CANNABIS</h4>
	Another potential PTSD treatment among military personnel is medical cannabis -- although it has proven difficult to use due to government regulations. The VA Hospital system and their physicians must follow federal law, which still classifies cannabis as a Schedule I drug, with no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.  

The tide, however, is starting to change, albeit slowly. The Veterans Equal Access Act was introduced in November 2014. It directs the Secretary of VA to authorize VA healthcare providers to: (1) provide veterans with recommendations and opinions regarding participation in their state’s cannabis programs, and (2) complete forms reflecting such recommendations and opinions. It is currently in the Subcommittee on Health.  

How did medical cannabis enter the picture? Since there is a dearth of effective treatment options for PTSD, patients who experimented with medical cannabis started to report improvement in their symptoms. Several studies showed efficacy in reduction of symptoms associated with PTSD and medical cannabis<sup>[<a href="#references">10</a>]</sup> including a study on Nabilone (a man-made form of cannabis), an endo-cannabinoid receptor agonist, which decreased nightmares in PTSD patients.<sup>[<a href="#references">11</a>]</sup>  

The endo-cannabinoid system (ECS) is distributed throughout the brain and the body. In the brain, the ECS regulates synaptic release of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters. The ECS may play a role in homeostasis by preventing severe cortical excitation and inhibition, and it may be impaired in some mental diseases.<sup>[<a href="#references">12</a>]</sup>   

<h4>HOW DOES MEDICAL CANNABIS HELP WITH PTSD SYMPTOMS? </h4>
Some specific effects of medical cannabis, such as sedation, relaxation, reduction of anxiety and sleep-induction, may explain its use as an attempt to cope with some PTSD symptoms. Sleep disorders, such as nightmares and insomnia, are reported in over 70% of patients diagnosed with PTSD.11 There are several hypotheses on how some of these effects are achieved. There is a very high concentration of endo-cannabinoid receptors (CB1) in the areas of the brain that are involved in the processing of memory, emotional reactions, decision-making and the fear system (hippocampus, amygdala, limbic system). Endocannabinoids may provide an amnestic effect and have a role in the extinction (“forgetting”) of unpleasant memories.<sup>[<a href="#references">13,14</a>]</sup> 

In response to stress, the body releases the hormone cortisol to help mitigate the biological changes associated with stress. However, repeated exposure to stress and prolonged secretion of cortisol can lead to harmful effects on the body. Research has shown that the ECS regulates structures that are involved in cortisol secretion (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis).<sup>[<a href="#references">15</a>]</sup> In turn, medical cannabis may reduce the emotional impact of traumatic memories through a complex set of mechanisms that might facilitate sleep and reduce anxiety in people with PTSD.

Unfortunately, not all the effects from medicinal cannabis are positive. Some people report side effects such as anxiety<sup>[<a href="#references">16,17</a>]</sup>, paranoia<sup>[<a href="#references">18</a>]</sup>, and sleep disturbances<sup>[<a href="#references">19</a>]</sup>, which can all exacerbate the PTSD symptoms individuals are using medical cannabis to treat in the first place. Further research is necessary to illuminate which cannabinoids provide good treatment options with the least side effects; for example, a high cannabidiol and low tetrahydrocannabinol (CBD:THC) ratio. Some of the undesirable side effects have been attributed to THC.<sup>[<a href="#references">20</a>]</sup>  

There has been significant progress in the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD.  However, better long-term treatment options are necessary. As with most psychological issues, combination therapy is the most effective. Pharmacotherapy, by itself, will not resolve the issue.

<h2>CALIFORNIA</h2>
<p>Nearly 20 years after California made medical cannabis legal, the state has finally put a framework of regulations in place for the industry. California Governor Jerry Brown signed three bills into law on October 9 creating a system of oversight for the growth, manufacture and sale of medical cannabis in the state. Governor Brown said the new regulations will ensure patients have access to medical cannabis, and will implement a “robust tracking system.” The first statewide operating and licensing rules for cannabis growers, product manufacturers and retail shops are aimed at bringing order and oversight to the state’s approximately $1.3 billion medical cannabis industry, reported the Los Angeles Times.  </p>

<h2>SOUTH DAKOTA</h2> 
<p>The Santee Sioux tribe is opening the nation’s first cannabis resort on its reservation. Santee Sioux leaders plan to grow their own cannabis and sell it in a smoking lounge that includes a nightclub, arcade games, bar and food service, and eventually, slot machines and an outdoor music venue. The grow facility is already underway with the first joints expected to go on sale Dec. 31 at a New Year’s Eve party. The legalization of cannabis on the Santee Sioux land came in June, months after the Justice Department outlined a new policy that allows Indian tribes to grow and sell cannabis under the same conditions as some states. A marijuana resort open to the public has never been tried in the U.S.</p>

 <h2>COLORADO</h2>
<p>The Denver Post reported monthly Colorado cannabis sales have soared past the $100 million mark for the first time, according to the August recreational and medical cannabis sales data from the state’s Department of Revenue. In a continuing trend, cannabis sales surpassed the previous month’s numbers with recreational marijuana coming in at $59.2 million and medical cannabis tallying $41.4 million. The combined $100.6 million in cannabis sales continues the month-to-month record-setting trend for 2015. According to The Denver Post, the most-watched figure in the state’s cannabis tax data is the 15 percent excise tax that is earmarked for school construction projects. In August, that tax brought in $3.3 million, up from $3.1 million in July.</p>

Adults 21 years of age and older are now able to legally purchase up to a quarter-ounce of cannabis and up to four cannabis plant seedlings from certain medical cannabis dispensaries, which are regulated by the Oregon Health Authority. The voter initiative that made cannabis legal, Measure 91, was approved 56 percent – 44 percent in 2014. </p>

In October the Michigan House signed off on expansive plans to create a highly-regulated medical cannabis industry and allow patients to purchase the drug at storefront dispensaries, which would be taxed. House Bill 4209, approved in a 95-11 vote and now heading to the Senate, would create a new state board to license dispensaries, large-scale growers, processors, distributors and testing facilities in communities that allow them. The House also approved bills to create a “seed-to-sale” tracking system for medical cannabis and extend legal protections to registered patients who prefer to use edibles and oils rather than smoking it.</p>

		<title>MMC Depot develops revolutionary packaging line for cannabis industry</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[MMC Depot, a veteran in the cannabis packaging arena, is about to take the industry by storm with the introduction of a revolutionary new product this month. 

“We believe we have identified the perfect storage containers. We have spent over two years in the research and development of our new Evolution line which we have specifically created for the marijuana industry,” explained Dovid Zussman, Director of MMC Depot. “We are launching a brand-new line of products designed specifically for cannabis and will dramatically improve the patient and consumer experience.”

With over 500 dispensaries, growers, and edible companies throughout the country making up their client base, MCC Depot has the knowledge and expertise to develop packaging products for the cannabis industry. “We took into consideration many things while developing this packaging line including brandability, ease of use, child safety and environmental concerns such as climate and heat,” said Zussman.“Our Evolution line sets the standard for air and odor resistance which ensures the product, flower or bud retains its freshness.”

American-made using the highest standards of quality, MMC Depot’s Evolution products, which are part of the company’s CoolJarz line, have not been retrofitted from another industry but custom made for cannabis.

One particular product in the Evolution line has been made specifically for hash oil. “There’s a negative stereotype associated with the traditional method by which oils have been sold such as oral syringes that has to do with heroin, and because the industry needs to distinguish itself away from that we developed CRringe,” enthused Zussman. “It’s the first of its kind, it’s child resistant,and is unlike anything anybody has ever seen in this industry for the packaging of hash oils. It is patient-friendly, displays very well on the retail level, and takes everything into consideration with regard to compliance and safety issues.”

Compliance and safety issues are something MCC Depot knows a lot about. “We are full-service in packaging, printing and design for the cannabis industry,” Zussman emphasized of the company’s all-inclusive, full-service product offering, “but, most importantly, where Nevada is now, is where we were a few years ago in Denver so we have plenty of experience to draw from.”

Based out of Denver, MCC Depot will be able to handle Nevada’s packaging needs locally because they are opening a Las Vegas outpost during the first quarter of 2016.This will allow the company to offer same-day service to their customers. 

In addition to quick service, MCC Depot also offers branding, product development and design, and a full array of packaging solutions with factory direct pricing. “In other words, we are a full-service packaging supply partner.”

		<title>Daughter’s illness inspires dispensary owner to give Nevada’s patients ReLeaf</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dana Marshall-Bernstein, 26, has lived with Crohn’s disease, an autoimmune disorder that attacks the digestive system, since she was three years old. 
	
“I have a very, very severe case that has meant I have had to go the surgical route and have had 10+ surgeries,” Dana says, pausing, “at this point I have lost count. It’s been surgery after surgery of bowel resections where they remove a portion of the intestines. It was during those surgeries when I was at USC that we started to see how sick the narcotics were making me. I couldn’t function at all when I was taking them. And you can’t do it (surgery) without narcotics because it is so painful.”

Dana’s multiple surgeries and resulting experience with narcotics was the impetus for her to try medical cannabis. “I was at the point where I was willing to try anything that I could to avoid taking narcotics. I tried acupuncture, herbal remedies, and nothing, unfortunately, worked until I started using medical marijuana,” explains Dana, who medicated with cannabis using a vaporizer one to two times a day intermittently between 2007 and 2010.

Medicinal cannabis took away Dana’s nausea and helped her to sleep. “On top of it, when I would wake up the next morning, I would feel great, unlike when I would take a narcotic,” she adds. 

There’s no doubt in Dana’s mind that cannabis is a non-addictive substance. “There were periods where I would use it after surgery and then not need it anymore and not smoke it for months up until my next surgery. You can stop on a dime,” notes Dana, unlike the narcotics she took. “I wasn’t walking around stoned all the time but, unfortunately, that’s the stigma. It was the most helpful form of pain control I have ever been on.”

As Dana’s father, personal injury attorney Ed Bernstein, began to learn more about cannabis, it became a community issue for him. “Her illness motivated me to understand the positive medical properties of cannabis,” explains Ed, who is a co-owner of Las Vegas ReLeaf, a dispensary located at 2242 Paradise Road, which opened in October. 

“I was very interested in having a dispensary that could service sick patients and offer very natural and organic strains that were lab tested,” Ed says, continuing, “I feel that we have the nicest dispensary in the country. We are trying to create a dispensary that is compassionate to patients, that is inviting, that is professional. We have some really knowledgeable staff and budtenders who are very familiar with the different strains and medical benefits.”

Currently offering products that include high CBD topicals and tinctures as well as a variety of high THC strains, Ed hopes that the relief he brings to Nevada’s patients through Las Vegas ReLeaf will give people like his daughter  their quality of life back. <a href="http://lasvegasreleaf.com/" target="_blank" title="Visit Las Vegas Releaf's Website">LasVegasReleaf.com</a>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[[one_half]
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
Makes 8 servings
2 cups of sugar
2 cups of cannabis simple syrup* (or 1-1/5 cups of cannabis honey)
4 cups cranberries (about 1 lb.)
1 tablespoon of orange zest
2 tablespoons lemon juice
1/4 cup orange liqueur or orange juice

[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>DIRECTIONS: </h3>
Combine and bring sugar and cannabis simple syrup to a boil until the sugar is dissolved. Boil the syrup for five minutes, add the cranberries. Simmer the cranberries in syrup gently, uncovered and without stirring until berries are translucent, about 5 minutes. Skim off the foam and add orange zest. Pour berries into a large bowl that has been rinsed in cold water. Chill until firm and serve cold.

<h3>RECIPE FOR CANNABIS SIMPLE SYRUP OR HONEY</h3>
Need to sweeten your drink or other liquids but want to give it a medicinal kick while you’re at it? Infusing simple sugar syrups or honey with cannabis is as easy as making tea…a very slooooooooow-brewed tea.

<h3>*DIRECTIONS FOR CANNABIS SIMPLE SYRUP OR HONEY:</h3>
1. For each ounce of cannabis, use 5 to 10 cups of simple syrup 
(or 5 lbs. of honey).
2. After removing the stems and seeds from your cannabis, grind or chop it and set aside.
3. Mix sugar and water at a ratio of 2 cups sugar for every cup of water. Bring to a boil and reduce to medium heat until achieving desired consistency of syrup.
4. Add ground or chopped cannabis and simple syrup into crockpot.
5. Cook the syrup up to 24 hours to get as much THC into the 
mixture as possible.

8. Strain out the cannabis by pouring mixture through a fine sieve and then pour your syrup into mason jars for storage away from light.
9. To get even more out of your simple syrup by packing in extra flavor, try adding chopped ginger, peppercorns, mint, or basil. Start with a cup and experiment with more or less depending on your taste preferences.

<strong>COOKING TIP:</strong> Honey is 20% sweeter than sugar, so use less honey when substituting for sugar.

[/one_half_last]

[mark style="dark"]
*Please remember that when cooking with medicinal cannabis you are cooking with a drug and the amounts of the drug and portions of the food ingested should always be taken into consideration. Always start out with small portions or doses and wait 30 minutes to an hour before eating any additional portions of food prepared with medical marijuana.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Monique On, 31, is like every young woman in her thirties: active, driven and full of life. But that wasn’t always the case, not even close. By 19 years old, On knew more about pain than most people do in their lifetime.  

At 14 years old, most girls are entering puberty and discovering their bodies. But for On, that’s when the darkness crept in. Over the next 12 years, the cause of On’s extreme pelvic pain remained a mystery to her and her doctors, until she was finally diagnosed with endometriosis at the age of 26. 

But On’s misery did not end there. Between playing hide-and-seek with an autoimmune disease for most of her adolescence, she was diagnosed with the six-letter-word no one wants to hear from a physician: cancer. When On was 19 years old, she found out she also had cervical cancer.

With two illnesses as aggressive as cancer and endometriosis, On was married to prescription drugs and painkillers for far too long. 

During what she calls her ‘dark days’, On’s physician had her taking prescription painkillers, anxiety medication, antidepressants and hormone treatments for endometriosis—all at the same time. 

“I was basically a zombie. I fell behind in my life. I even lost friends,” she explains. In other words, according to On, “It really sucked.”

On was spending up to a week at a time bedridden, left with only her then-husband to care for her.
	
Worried for her health, he suggested a solution, which, at the time, insulted her. On grew up in a home with an addict and had no tolerance for drugs. That is, until she was 24 years old.

On only remembers thinking, “I can’t handle the pain anymore. I’ll take anything to feel better. I will do anything to get my health back and to live my life again.”

Her first date with cannabis oil was seven years ago. Since that time, On has completely divorced herself from prescription painkillers. 

“The relief was instant. The results were immediate,” explains On. “It’s better than any other drug I’ve been prescribed.”

Now, even in the workplace, she is an activist for medical cannabis. On feels so strongly about the cause, she has even refused job offers where they did not recognize cannabis as a medication.

On’s adolescence was stolen from her, but she refuses to surrender to the chronic pain from endometriosis ever again.	

“I’m still here. I’m so much better and I have my life back. That’s the most rewarding thing about finding [it]!”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In a stunning reversal of prior policy, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department has summarily revoked medical marijuana patients’ qualification for concealed carry permits in Clark County. The move comes as slap in the face to medical marijuana patients who had hoped for a better relationship with law enforcement as the stigma surrounding marijuana use continues to erode around the country.

Prior to the abrupt shift in policy, Clark County’s concealed carry permit application did not ask whether an applicant was a medical marijuana patient. However, recent changes to the application plainly state that medical marijuana patients do not qualify due to the federal prohibition on marijuana.

Consequently, it appears that Metro will not allow any medical marijuana patients to apply for a concealed carry permit within Clark County. It is unclear how Metro would determine whether or not an applicant is a medical marijuana patient as the list of patients is confidential.

The only reason Metro or any other law enforcement agency is permitted to access the list is to determine whether or not an individual is allowed to possess marijuana for medical purposes. Thus, if Metro is cross-referencing the list of patients with the names of concealed carry applicants, they are doing so in clear violation of Nevada law. As such, I expect this matter to end up before the Nevada court system.

Nevertheless, applications from other Nevada counties do not ask whether the applicant is a patient, therefore it may be possible for patients to apply in counties outside of Clark. If you have questions regarding your rights as a medical marijuana patient, you should contact a Nevada attorney who is familiar with Nevada’s complex marijuana laws.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s no different than the pharmacy on the corner,” explains Tom Roberts, Deputy Chief of the Investigative Services Division for the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. “Medicinal marijuana is legal and so we are going to do what we can to support the businesses that operate in the industry and the people who consume it.”

With almost a half-dozen medical cannabis dispensaries now open in Southern Nevada, Chief Deputy Roberts and the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (Metro) believe licensing dispensaries is necessary. 

“I think the dispensaries opening and the ability to have growers and the regulation of the market is a positive step,” says Roberts. 

“I believe that like anything, the industry will find a cheaper, more effective way to do it, and if it’s regulated, then you know that people are getting what they should be getting. I think that’s a positive for the industry.”

Though licensed dispensaries began opening this year, medicinal cannabis has been legal in Nevada since 2000, with access to medicine only available to patients who grew their own plants. 

“We have had medical marijuana in our state for some time, so our officers are used to dealing with medical marijuana patients. Of course, the change now is we are moving from homegrown and self-medicating to dispensaries. I don’t think our philosophy has changed, we just have to be careful that we educate our employees on what the law is, and what we can and can’t do,” Deputy Chief Roberts notes. 

As a progressive organization, Metro is proactive in keeping their officers up to speed as laws change and medicinal cannabis regulations are put in place. Metro is training its officers with Powerpoint presentations, including how to identify an official medicinal cannabis patient card. 

Roberts and his colleagues also met with their law enforcement counterparts in other jurisdictions such as Colorado and Washington to learn what kind of challenges they can expect as the industry opens to the public. 

Crime, illegal operations, robbery and theft can be expected, but their Colorado brethren also emphasized the challenges Metro might encounter with regard to edibles. “In Colorado, they were making really potent edibles and people weren’t following the directions, and so they were having psychotic episodes. There were a few murders and suicides associated with edibles,” Roberts says.

“That is one of the biggest dangers that I see for public safety -- edibles, oils, extracts and overconsumption. Children ingesting edibles is another problem Colorado ran into. If you are consuming or medicating, keep it out of the reach of children. If you are using edibles, remember what they may look like to somebody else. Don’t leave them lying around,” cautions Roberts. 

Another unforeseen issue in Colorado has revolved around pets. “Pets were eating this stuff and becoming sick.” 

Deputy Chief Roberts warns: “It’s like anything else, you certainly don’t leave your prescription pills sitting out. You should have childproof caps. That’s what the industry needs to look at, if it’s all about medicine and public safety -- maybe provide containers that are childproof or offer protection.” 

As long as patients are obeying the law, Deputy Chef Roberts says they should not be concerned about any interactions they may have with Metro while in possession of medical cannabis. Metro will approach medical cannabis responsibly, treating it like any other legal substance, and urges users to do the same.

SIDEBAR: SAFETY TIPS FROM LAS VEGAS METRO
“If you are a medicinal marijuana patient and you have a card, you shouldn’t fear law enforcement. You should be comfortable being a medicinal marijuana user in Southern Nevada,” explained Metro’s Deputy Chief Roberts, especially if patients keep the following in mind when medicating with cannabis.

Should you come in contact with law enforcement, explain that you are a medical cannabis patient and have some in your possession. “If the officer has more information on the frontend, than they are more apt to not make judgments or draw conclusions that it’s illegal,” says Roberts.

 Don’t be afraid to transport medical cannabis in your car.

   
Don’t drive while medicating with cannabis. “Even though you may feel that it is safe, your impairment and your judgment and your reaction time is diminished,” Roberts explains of driving while under the influence of medical cannabis.  “It is legal. It’s no different than anything else,” Roberts imparts, adding, “Please just use it responsibly, just like you would anything else.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Having graduated from Carson High School, University of Nevada, Reno, and the Boyd School of Law at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Matt Griffin is undoubtedly loyal to the Silver State. The fifth generation Nevadan, who specializes in initiative petitions, has worked on almost 20 since 2010 that have included a spectrum of issues from the Personhood Amendment in 2012 to Nevada’s Margin Tax for Public Schools last year. But the one most germane to MMEs is IP1 which will appear on the ballot in November 2016 and would tax and regulate marijuana similarly to alcohol.

<h3>WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON MEDICAL CANNABIS?</h3>
In my opinion, the science is undeniable, and I believe it helps -- at least some people. I have never been given a legitimate reason why a proven remedy like marijuana should be denied to a patient. No one has convinced me that medical marijuana is worse than any prescriptions you get from your doctor. 

<h3>HOW DID YOU BECOME INVOLVED IN THE CANNABIS INDUSTRY?</h3> 
My particular focus is government affairs and initiative petitions. Marijuana Policy Project approached me about working on drafting a petition to circulate for signatures in 2014 and to appear on the ballot in 2016. They called me to see if I would work on it and I couldn’t think of a legitimate reason as to why I would oppose the issue. 

<h3>WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO WORK ON IP1?</h3>
It appealed to me. From a policy perspective this issue is appropriate for direct democracy and a vote of the people. Social issues like this are appropriate for the ballot box. My involvement is to draft petitions for issues that I believe are deserving of a vote. 

<h3>RECIPROCITY…NOT A LOT OF STATES THOUGHT TO INCLUDE THAT IN THEIR REGULATORY FRAMEWORK?</h3>
These things get passed because a lot of people like it. It was a very logical application. Our state depends on tourism and when tourists come here to visit they need to be able to take their medicine legally.
 
<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CHANCES ARE NEVADA VOTERS WILL PASS IP1 IN NOVEMBER 2016?</h3>
This is an issue, by necessity, that must be handled by the states. The people of the state should have the opportunity to vote on it. If voters are ever going to pass it, a presidential year is the best chance it has to pass. Everybody likes to say their state is unique. It’s everybody’s line about their state, but Nevada really is unique insofar as many voters identify with libertarian issues, and marijuana isn’t a Democrat versus Republican issue.

<h3>DO YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF AN ACTIVIST?</h3>
I would characterize myself as someone who philosophically had no objection to the issue. I had a limited role that I could play in bringing the petition to fruition. I wouldn’t characterize myself as an activist or someone seeking social justice or change. In my mind, it’s an issue that the people should vote on and have a say on. 

<h3>DO YOU THINK IN 10 YEARS THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH MARIJUANA WILL BE A THING OF THE PAST AND CANNABIS WILL BE THOUGHT OF AS LEGITIMATE MEDICINE?</h3>
I have every confidence that within a few years it will be a mainstream business. I think the investment in cannabis is just beginning. First of all, I think as the science around it further develops there’s going to be the ability for people to better gauge the potency and effects of marijuana. That will go a long way in making it mainstream. Secondly, the probability of consuming marijuana by smoking a joint in ten years will be largely a thing of the past.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After decades of prohibition the cannabis industry is, to quote truth teller Steven DeAngelo, emerging from the shadows and coming into the light. As legalization slowly starts to materialize across the United States so much has changed for those mavericks who have been proponents of cannabis during its darkest days. Elevate spoke with three of the industry’s trailblazers to find out how much the world has changed for them since cannabis became a recognized emerging industry.

<strong>DJ SHORT
Cannabis Cultivator</strong>
Imagine toiling on your life’s work in total darkness. Tending to its growth and cultivating its development in a vacuum for 40 years. Every step of the way looking over your shoulder and sleeping with one eye open due to its illegality.
<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2032" src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/evo-one-294x300.jpg" alt="DJ Short" width="294" height="300" />
“We are coming up on 10 years that it’s been that I have been comfortable out in the open now,” reflects DJ Short, who is perhaps the most prolific cannabis breeder in the U.S., of the country’s state by state legalization of cannabis. “It is becoming a reality, we are just coming out of that fog now. I am still reflexively kind of functioning as though it is still back in the day.”
With four decades of cultivating cannabis to his credit, America’s most noted breeding luminary is “tickled pink” yet not terribly surprised by this turn of events. “I made this prediction decades ago in the ’80s, I said legalization will happen and when it does it will unfold in a way that nobody can predict.”

It was over 35 years ago that Short first recognized there was a future in cannabis in spite of the circumstances. “In ’81 or ’82 someone had given me a copy of one of the first seed bank catalogs. It was basically a number of mimeographed pages, but when I saw what they were charging for what they were crossing, I realized then that this was going to get much bigger.”

Short’s forecast has come to fruition. “I see great opportunity here. We have a fully developed industry. It’s about to become above water level, doable, that people are going to actually make happen. The demand is going to increase incredibly.”

Although sunny in his outlook, Short does caution fellow mavericks of the industry about the perils of monopolization and capitalism. “The decent members of our community have an opportunity to show the world how to do capitalism right. I am vehemently opposed to the monopolization of anything.

“Good luck to the people trying to do that. I don’t know where their head is at. If the last 80 years have taught us anything, it’s that you cannot control this plant. Anytime you are going to try and monopolize on it, it will just cause the black market to thrive.”

Quick to say he “sucks” at capitalism, Short’s own future plans include seeds, writing and speaking. “I want to do R&amp;D. I have only released about 30 or 40 percent of my library. I have a bunch of other things that are completely unique, not related to anybody else’s work. They have pedigree. My intent is to lease or sell strains. Also, my focus will be on extraction. So I am going to breed plants strictly for extraction.”

Even though Short has released less than half of his library, they are bountiful. Phylos Bioscience, a research and diagnostics company in Oregon focused on cannabis genomics, has shared with Short “that 80+ percent of hybrids out there all have my genetic marker in them. I have been releasing genetics since the late ’70s early ’80s so it is not a surprise.”

Short’s activism will also play a role. He references Open Cannabis Project, which is building an archival record of all existing cannabis strains to ensure they remain in the public domain. “I am for it, a huge proponent,” enthuses Short of making cannabis public domain. “For me, it’s the only way to protect myself from a Monsanto-esque situation in the future.”

It’s telling that Short will go from protecting himself from government DEA busts to protecting his legacy from corporate monopolization all in his lifetime. But like he said, no one can predict how things will unfold.

<strong>Tripp Keber,
CEO of Dixie Brands</strong>
“The one thing I have been accused of often is delusional confidence and that can work for you or against you,” Tripp Keber, CEO of Dixie Brands, conveys with a chuckle. “Sometimes as Kenny Rogers says ‘you got to know when to hold ‘em and know when to fold ‘em.’ But I will not quit.
I am all chips in.”

Keber quickly went from “just dabbling” which is how he describes lending money to cultivators in 2009 to going all in on a brand that has enjoyed exponential growth. In less than five years, Dixie’s lines of cannabis-infused chocolates, carbonated drinks, topicals, tinctures, and mints has grown to approximately 155 products, and just last month the brand announced its foray into the international market.

Although relatively short, Keber’s cannabis journey had its share of bad hands in the beginning. “My intention was really to be just the money and be completely invisible, behind the scenes, and unfortunately many people were more interested in medicating than manufacturing,” explains Keber of how he ended up taking a bigger role than he originally had intended.

The idea that started it all was to make cannabis into a drinkable format called Dixie Elixir. “I had no idea how to make a pot soda. But these team members of mine thought it would work. The reality was it was good, it just needed to get better. In 2010 there was no testing facility, there was no dosing, no packaging requirements.

“If you look at the evolution of my brand it starts off pretty janky. Our product was a glass bottle with a big marijuana leaf on it and we were literally buying grape soda from Wal-Mart and pouring into a vat,” Keber admits. But packaging and ingredients were the least of Keber’s challenges.

“One day I showed up at my facility, which was basically a 400-square-foot kind of a drug house, and they (his staff) were all either intoxicated from marijuana or alcohol and I had to make a decision right then and there as to how my business was going to evolve and without consulting my business partner I fired everybody.”

Keber says after firing his entire team he “literally broke down” and that he “was terrified because I had crossed the Rubicon and burned the boats.”

With the die cast, Keber was forced to make his gamble a success. It would seem the gambling gods were on his side though -- especially with the unforeseen enthusiasm for cannabis-infused products which is the Denver-based company’s wheelhouse.

“The future of cannabis is obviously my tagline, but not because I believe so supremely in my brand, although I do, it is because the future of cannabis is oil. It’s infused products,” forecasts Keber, who lays out the past, present and future of cannabis-infused products.

The Dixie CEO explains that cannabis-infused products were “five percent of a $60-million-dollar marijuana market in 2010. Last year it was a $700-million-dollar market in Colorado of which 45 percent of the market was infused products. This year we will sell darn close to a $1 billion dollars in revenue as an industry, both medical and recreational, and more than 55 percent are going to be infused products. So we went from a $2.5- to $3-million-dollar market in 20ı0 to what is now going to be a $500-plus-million-dollar market in 2015.”

From a 400-square-foot wood shed to a state-of-the-art 30,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, Keber has put all his chips on the table, noting that he believes Dixie has some of the most sophisticated delivery systems, packaging platforms, labeling that there is on the market.

“I am not going to make any grandiose, irrational statement but I fundamentally believe that we are going to win.”

<strong>Steven DeAngelo,
activist and co-founder,
Harborside Health Center
</strong>For four decades and a variety of roles later, ranging from activist and entrepreneur to dispensary owner and angel investor, Steven DeAngelo, who prefers to be just known as a truth teller, has undoubtedly been one of cannabis’ most vocal advocates.
<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2034" src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/evo-two-231x300.jpg" alt="Steven DeAngelo" width="231" height="300" />
“I actually knew it (cannabis) was going to play an important role in my life as soon as a consumed it. I didn’t think it was going to be my life’s mission because I didn’t think it would take this long. I thought it would only take five or 10 years and then I would be on to other things I wanted to advocate for,” relays DeAngelo, who is 57.

DeAngelo was confidant it would be a short-term gig because in the ’70s 15 states had passed decriminalization bills under President Jimmy Carter and so he and his fellow activists “thought we had it in the bag.”

But along came President Ronald Reagan and his much ballyhooed War on Drugs. “Up until the 1980s we made pretty steady progress. We didn’t envision the landslide win of Ronald Reagan and his steady rollback of all the progress we had made,” recounts DeAngelo.

DeAngelo’s transition to entrepreneurial ventures was a means to his activist ends. “I am equal parts activist and entrepreneur, I have always been both. I found that I really hated asking rich people to fund my activist work. I have found a niche business that allows me to simultaneously support my family and pursue my goals,” he explains.

Over the years, DeAngelo’s businesses have included industrial hemp company Ecolution, Harborside Health Center in Oakland, California, cannabis testing firm Steephill Lab Group, and ArcView Group, an angel investor network funding cannabis businesses. With his attention focused on so many cannabis-centric interests, DeAngelo is easily able to predict cannabis’ next big thing, much like he did in 2006 when he shifted the paradigm on what a dispensary should look like or implemented lab testing in 2007, long before it was required.

As for the future, he is quick to list off a few shifts he foresees such as a move from raw flower to infused products as well as a change in edible dosing. “Up to now the most popular edibles have been high dose. We are now seeing a demand for a lower dose edible that would taste better, allow people to eat more, and have a lower level of cannabinoids.

“You are also going to see a lot of new adopters. A lot of people who were not going to consider using it when it was illegal will now consider it because it is legal.”

This is not to say DeAngelo has not experienced a few surprises. “I think the biggest shock for me was to discover the powerful preventative and curative properties it has for grave diseases. I knew it was a good plant and I knew the world would be a better place with cannabis in it but I didn’t know about its ability to help those with Alzheimer’s or that it could cure cancer or that it would be the medicine to cure hundreds of thousands of children with epilepsy.”

He also concedes that prohibition still amazes him. “I just continue operating in a state approaching disbelief that the federal government and state governments still, with the abundance of scientific research, continue to be obstructionists to this plant,” he says incredulously. “It is just as inexplicable to me now as it was when I started this 40 years ago. It was and continues to be an ever-present daily shock for me.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Packing up and leaving your friends, family, and home behind is not an easy decision, but when the only relief to an illness is considered an illegal substance in many parts of the country, what choice do patients and parents of patients have? 

The Travel Joint understands how difficult these circumstances can be and empathizes so much so that they started a program to help families of patients who need medical cannabis and don’t have access to it in their state.

The Cannabis Refugee Program was established by the Travel Joint to alleviate the financial burden of patients who need to focus on healing instead of the financial strain of relocating to a new state. 

Since the launch of the program earlier this year, the Travel Joint has received a constant flow of applications from families seeking financial and emotional support to relocate. Unfortunately, not everyone is as sympathetic to the cause as the Travel Joint. 

With 20ı5 coming to a close, the Cannabis Refugee Program has yet to relocate its first family due to roadblocks in funding. “We have over 80 applicants and we understand their needs,” says Travel Joint’s Rachel Zimbelman, “but we are basically creating resources that literally don’t exist right now.”

The Travel Joint initially anticipated a large amount of aid from outside businesses, but funding from the larger companies fell short during what should have been the non-profit’s first round of fundraising.

So until the Cannabis Refugee Program is up, running, and collecting funds, needy families will be forced to travel between their current home and nearby states where cannabis is legally recognized as a medicine. 

“The problem in this, besides how expensive it is, is legality,” explains Zimbelman. “Right now, parents can’t transport the cannabis over state lines, so they have to keep going back and forth between states.”

While cannabis’ federally illegal status is wreaking havoc on the lives of patients and their families, the Travel Joint is exploring every fundraising option available. They have even investigated the possibility of raising money via a reality television show surrounding the lives of cannabis refugees during their relocation and transition.

The Cannabis Refugee Program plans to move its first family to Colorado by the end of the year. Zimbelman hopes for an increase in funding as more people come to understand the severity of the refugees’ struggles.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wish granters and board members at Wish Upon a Wedding believe in the celebration of love—even in the face of catastrophic illness and life-altering situations.

The non-profit organization, which is made up of wedding and hospitality professionals, was formed to help extraordinary couples say, “I do.”  

In 20ı0, wedding photographer and president of the Las Vegas Chapter, Adam Frazier, joined the non-profit organization in holy matrimony. Since the founding of the Las Vegas Chapter, Frazier and his team of wish granters have granted five weddings. And they are itching to do more.

Las Vegas is known as the marriage capital of the world (cue wedding bells). Thanks to this title, Frazier had no difficulty building a network of eager and generous wish granters. 

The question is, then, why has there only been one wedding granted each year by the Las Vegas Chapter? Two words: cold feet. “The most difficult part is finding couples,” explains Frazier. “We’ve had couples who started the wish process, but backed out because they started to feel self-conscious about receiving our free services.”

These unconventional pre-wedding jitters have turned into a huge roadblock for the organization. Wish granters are struggling to connect with couples who, according to Frazier, want to honor their love but at times surrender to their guilt for accepting Wish Upon a Wedding’s donated services. The charity’s donated services include a wedding planner, catering and rentals, hotel accommodation for one night, the venue, a florist, and a photographer and videographer.  

For Frazier, the work that goes into granting weddings has never felt like a heavy burden or a sacrifice. Instead, it feels like a gift. 

“I want our couples to know that they don’t have to fall through the cracks,” says Frazier. “We won’t let them because we are really excited to do this.” 

At the core of every wedding is a love story, and the wish granters promise each couple one day completely free of worries and full of love.

“When you strip all of the layers away, the couples are left with one moment. And our job is to preserve that moment,” says Frazier.

Wish Upon a Wedding grants two kinds of wishes. The Classic Wish will be granted when one person in the couple is diagnosed with a terminal illness with a prognosis of five years or less, or is facing a serious life-altering circumstance. Those facing a prognosis of ı2 months or less will be granted an Urgent Wish.

Frazier asks couples to be courageous in celebrating their love the same way they have courageously fought through devastating obstacles. The Las Vegas Chapter invites couples to start the simple application process online through Wish Upon a Wedding’s website, www.wishuponawedding.org.

“We are all sitting at the edge of our seats waiting for the next couple!” says Frazier.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[An idea that started out as a casual way for people to connect about the benefits of cannabis has grown into an advocacy organization that has donated approximately $27,000 in aid to patients in the Las Vegas Valley. 

 “About eight years ago, I was looking around at different groups who used cannabis, but had no real way of connecting with each other. So I started the meet-up to help form friendships,” recalls Jennifer Solas, founder of WeCan, of how she started the organization in 2007. “It really started out of the need for patients to connect with other cannabis patients in Nevada.”

Solas’ effort to organize a support group and educate patients in Nevada about medicinal cannabis resulted in Wellness Education Cannabis Advocates of Nevada, also known as WeCan, which has grown into an educational non-profit organization.

In 20ı2, WeCan established a Patient Program that provides financial support to patients in the valley who are struggling to obtain medical marijuana cards. Using funding from donations, sponsorships, WeCan membership fees, and the organization’s radio show, WeCan’s Patient Program is able to help five to seven Nevadans each month who have low or fixed incomes or are dealing with a devastating illness.

The Patient Program does not donate its money directly to the patients. Instead, WeCan provides patients with the medical marijuana card application. WeCan also works with doctors around the valley who are willing to donate services to patients. The patient is typically only responsible for the $ı3 card fee accessed at the Nevada DMV.

Patients accepted into WeCan’s program become ambassadors for the organization and are granted a one-year membership to the social group. The membership allows full access to WeCan’s social events and member-only online content. Once the membership expires, patients are invited to come back 
as volunteers. 

“Many people do come back and are eager to volunteer because they want to spread awareness about what WeCan and medicinal cannabis has done for them,” explains Solas.

Since the launch of the Patient Program, WeCan has helped approximately 90 patients in Nevada obtain their medical marijuana cards, representing over $27,000 in aid that WeCan gives back to patients. 

Patients in need of financial support can request an application by contacting Kurt Duchac, WeCan’s social outreach director, at kurt@wecan702.org.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Find Kathy Gillespie at work these days, and you’re likely to see someone spattered with spackling and paint. That’s a long way from her background in corporate America, but Gillespie and company have a lot of work to do. Opening a 70,000-square-foot combined cultivation, production and dispensary center isn’t going to happen without her hand on the project. 

“We’ve painted, we’ve spackled, we’ve laid the tile, we’ve cleaned the toilets,” Gillespie says with a laugh. “There isn’t anything I haven’t done.”

She is confident that the site, including the NevadaPure dispensary, will open in November (it was not open at press time). Sooner is better, Gillespie says, because it is costing her and other owners $5,000 a day in costs that have to be recouped. 

Gillespie takes Elevate on a tour of the cavernous building, which used to be, back before the days of the “do-not-call-list,” a call center with thousands of tiny desks filled with thousands of people on thousands of telephones. “There was a sea of cubicles down there.”

Now, banks of marijuana seedlings, hanging lights, a modern production facility for preparing both edible cannabis products and creams and salves for topical application, and a large, slick-looking dispensary have replaced the 3,000 or so cubicles and phone lines. To keep costs under control, Gillespie and her co-owners did the demolition themselves. That included five full dumpsters of carpeting, she says, the condition of which still makes her shudder. 

The thick concrete walls, largely without windows, of the first floor, however, provide the security that NevadaPure needs to keep its product safe and to fulfill state and local requirements. “We had a vision of what to do with it, what this building could do.”

Upstairs, there are offices for the executives. Gillespie has a corner office; next door is the woman with whom she has lived for some three decades, Barbara Allen. They are partners in life and business, both at NevadaPure and their other, ongoing business, A&B Printing. 

When we toured NevadaPure’s new center in early November, the bright Las Vegas sun had provided us a chamber-of-commerce kinday, but not for the facility’s employees, who were busy ramping up for an opening within a few weeks. 

It hasn’t been an easy path for Gillespie and company. There are some structural obstacles to building any medical cannabis business, and having all three components of the industry – cultivation, production, and dispensing – under one roof doesn’t make the process easier.

Gillespie sees two big threats to the emerging medical marijuana industry in Nevada. One is simply the amount of red-tape and bureaucracy that has to be navigated to win state and local approval for a cultivation or production center, or a dispensary.  

“It is so cumbersome of a process,” she says. “I personally feel the process could be greatly streamlined.”

The product is, Gillespie notes, “medicine, not plutonium.” 

The other, related but distinct, issue is that for now, at least, the cost of marijuana sold by unlicensed dispensaries that deliver to homes, or dealers that sell on the street, can undercut the legal, licensed product. 
She says, however, that people seeking specific products for particular medical needs are taking a real chance by buying on the street.

“How do you know what you’re smoking?” Gillespie notes. The Pure center, she says, will soon be able to compete with street prices because of the “vertical integration” of having the cultivation, production and retail sale all in one place. 

She says that by the time the Pure center is fully up and running, they may have as many as 10 distinct strains of cannabis that have been cultivated for years to produce exactly those qualities for which people are seeking. The emphasis is on providing a “safe, stable and secure supply of medicine.”

In practice, that means plants are cloned from verified strains with well-established characteristics. Gillespie shows us three clones of strains that are well-known to cannabis users, especially medical marijuana users: Lemon OG, Sour OG and the famous Charlotte’s Web, a strain rich in cannabidiol, or CBD, which many users believe is an effective treatment for some forms of epilepsy in adults and children, but low in the psychoactive component of tetrahydrocannabinol, THC. In other words, it has a medical application but isn’t likely to get users very high.

Gillespie says another strain, AC/DC, has similar attributes to Charlotte’s Web but with a higher plant yield, is less expensive to produce – an example of the continuing evolution of medical strains that is occurring throughout the industry. 

Strains with low THC are a core product for medical cannabis, she explains. “For someone like my partner, she doesn’t want to get stoned,” Gillespie says. “She wants to go home and then sleep and have a restful night, without taking a pill.”

Gillespie’s interest in seeds and strains and plants and vegetation isn’t new. Gillespie, 63, admits to a youthful dalliance with recreational marijuana a few – well, three or four – decades ago. But professionally, before building A&B Printing into one of Las Vegas’ biggest print shops over the last 15 years, she worked with several agricultural businesses, corporations with annual sales in the hundreds of millions. Gillespie, in fact, has a science degree from Purdue University in horticulture. 

Along her life path, Gillespie became an active supporter of progressive politics. Her commitment extends beyond her personal stake in lesbian-gay-bisexual and transgender issues; just about every progressive politician and campaign in Southern Nevada has their printing done at A&B, in part because that union “bug” printed on the campaign mailer is a must for those seeking labor’s support. 
A&B is a union shop, but so is NevadaPure, Gillespie says.

A&B has contributed about $60,000 so far this year to progressive causes and campaigns, she says. NevadaPure will continue that progressive heritage. 
During a long conversation, Gillespie relates a pair of experiences that cause her to choke up. Those experiences helped cement her progressive perspective – and they help explain why she feels that NevadaPure, and medical marijuana, are inherently progressive factors in the community.

One experience that brings tears to her eyes is the death of her father, a terrible trial that was the result of a lifetime of alcohol abuse, she says. “Nobody has ever died from an overdose of marijuana.”

Gillespie says that it would be much easier to get a license to sell alcohol despite the overwhelming evidence that alcohol can be toxic and deadly over both short and longtime spans. 

Another emotional trigger is her work with the gay community during the first years of the AIDS crisis, while she lived in upstate New York, when big pharmaceutical companies were slow to respond with research and drugs while thousands died. 

“Barbara and I, living in Syracuse, we must have had 20 of our closest friends die of HIV,” the virus that leads to AIDS. “I got a real distaste for the legal pharmaceutical companies.”

Medical marijuana would have eased the pain and strengthened patients facing those diseases in a way that traditional pharmaceuticals couldn’t, she says. Allen, Gillespie’s partner, faced similar end-of-life issues with her mother. 

Cannabis products can promote appetite and help patients who are on traditional pharmaceuticals, including chemotherapy for cancer. But without medical marijuana laws in place, “We had no safe way of getting it for our parents,” Gillespie says. 

In October, Gillespie received recognition for her community values. She was honored as the “Progressive Business Owner of 2015” by Battle Born Progress, a statewide group working for progressive causes such as raising the minimum wage and keeping public lands public. 

Gillespie admits that running A&B while building NevadaPure from scratch has not been an easy job. She been working 12- to 15-hour days for months, but the end of the beginning looks close, she says.  The goal is to get medicine into the hands of patients as soon as possible. 

Gillespie has no illusions about the pool of potential consumers. 

“For some people, this is just another vice,” she says. “It needs to be licensed and controlled. For some people, though, this is medication, and it needs to be regulated that way.”

The focus at NevadaPure will be to provide medicine that people need, she promises. Income is important, but not the final objective. “We’re not in this just to make a whole ton of money.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[THE APOTHECARY SHOPPE
Located at 4240 W. Flamingo across from the Palms Casino Resort, the Apothecary Shoppe has started seeing patients. The newly opened dispensary puts an emphasis on patient experience and wellness by employing wellness concierges who match patients’ needs to flowers, topicals, concentrates, and edibles that best suit a particular taste or need.

“The Apothecary Shoppe is more than a medical marijuana dispensary,” said Dr. Nick Spirtos, one of the dispensary’s owners. “We believe in a higher purpose, one devoted to the well-being of our patients and to the creation of a positive cannabis culture in Nevada.”

To that end, the Apothecary Shoppe has a staff doctor accessible to patients. “We believe having a licensed physician on-site is just one of the attributes that separates the Apothecary Shoppe from other dispensaries,” said Dr. Geoffrey Hsieh who, with Dr. Spirtos, will be enrolling patients in the first of several clinical trials. “Not only will we be able to provide valuable counsel to patients, but also oversee the critical research necessary to accurately address the full benefit of cannabis-based therapies.” 

The Apothecary Shoppe is open daily from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.

EVERGREEN ORGANIX Opens Cannabis Cultivation Facility

Evergreen Organix Cultivation (EGO) opened a 33,000-square-foot, 100 percent hydroponic facility in Clark County in November. “Evergreen Organix has built Nevada’s first state-of-the-art zero air exchange facility in order to bring the cleanest medicinal cannabis products to market,” said Jillian Nelson, Operations Manager of Evergreen Organix. “A zero air exchange facility will allow us to control the environment by dialing in the most optimal grow conditions and eliminate the need for toxic pesticides and, in turn, operate like a laboratory with a clean room controlled environment.”

Evergreen Organix will have the capacity to produce in excess of 29 cannabis strains including those with high CBD and CBN. EGO’s strain library includes proprietary breeds like Harlequin as well as early cannabis strains from Brothers Grim.

Evergreen’s cultivation facility also has a 3,400-square-foot production and a team of chefs who will be making a variety of edible products that are sugar-free, non-GMO, gluten-free, and vegan.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Kimberly Hillen, 31, has never been the type of person to back down from a challenge, so when a position opened up with her company across the country, it was not long until Hillen found herself sitting on an airplane. Destination? Las Vegas. 

But Hillen had no idea how big of a fray she was walking into.

As soon as she stepped off the plane, Hillen was met with 12-hour workdays, seven days a week. With a demanding schedule like this, it is no surprise that she woke up in a panic every morning. 

“I was on the verge of a mental breakdown every day,” explains Hillen. “I was scared. I was afraid I would fail at work.”
Alone in a new city, the sleepless nights seemed infinite. And for the first time in her life, Hillen thought this would be the one challenge to defeat her.

In an attempt to take her life back from insomnia and anxiety, Hillen gave Tylenol PM a chance. “It just didn’t feel right,” said Hillen. “It felt forced. And when I would wake up, it felt like my head wasn’t attached to my body.”

But Hillen is a fighter, and she knew she would come out on top one way or another.

And as fate would have it, Lance Parvin showed up at Hillen’s work desk a month later.

“We just clicked, and after a little bit of talking, he told me about his work,” explains Hillen. As co-founder of the Compassionate Awareness Project, paired with his background in herbal psychopharmacology, Parvin introduced Hillen to medicinal cannabis in the form of CBD oil.

Almost immediately after her meeting with Parvin, Hillen began taking CBD oil in a pill form.

And in the on-going match between Hillen and two debilitating conditions, the odds were not in Hillen’s favor. But with the healing powers of medicinal cannabis, she won the fight with a knockout, sending both insomnia and anxiety to the mat.

“I sleep through the night now,” says Hillen. “And in the morning, I don’t have this dark cloud hanging over me anymore.”

Hillen has now been medicating with CBD oil longer than she’s been in Las Vegas, and with no psychoactive effects, she doesn’t plan to stop. 

These days, Hillen feels like an unstoppable force. She is confident, energetic and doing well for herself. 

“Before trying [it], I was dealing with the weight of my conditions on my own,” Hillen reflects. “I was constantly in a panic. Now I can even pause during a busy day and I don’t feel scared.”
	
In the fight against insomnia and anxiety, Hillen is 1-0.

		<title>Can terminally ill patients use medical cannabis for pain relief while in hospice?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nevada medical cannabis laws clearly define who may qualify as a patient. A patient is someone who suffers from a chronic or debilitating medical condition that is defined as:
<ol style="padding:20px;">
	<li>AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) </li>
	<li>Cancer</li>
	<li>Glaucoma</li>
	<li>PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder)</li>
	<li>A medical condition that produces, for a specific patient, one or more of the following:
<ul style="padding:20px;">
	<li>Cachexia</li>
	<li>Persistent muscle spasms, including, without limitation, spasms caused by multiple sclerosis</li>
	<li>Seizures, including, without limitation, </li>
	<li>seizures caused by epilepsy</li>
	<li>Severe nausea</li>
	<li>Severe pain</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

Therefore, patients who are terminally ill and in hospice would most likely qualify for medical cannabis. However, there are restrictions on a hospice facility providing medical cannabis to its patients.
	
First, only individuals who have received a patient card, issued from Nevada’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health, can use medicinal cannabis. Also, those patients must legally obtain the medicine. A patient may designate a caregiver. Therefore, the terminally ill may be provided the medicine by a caregiver. However, the caregiver must also obtain a card from the Division. 

Second, an attending doctor cannot serve as the patient’s caregiver. Usually a caregiver is a family member or friend assisting with the patient’s care. The caregiver would have to obtain the medical cannabis and provide it to the patient. 

This could be an issue for hospice facilities, as the hospice could not dispense the medicine to its patients. Each patient who qualified and had a card would have to have his or her own medicine or his or her own caregiver bring it in to the facility. 

Complicating matters even further, hospice care is usually covered by insurance including Medicare. However, as cannabis is federally illegal (it is a Schedule 1 drug), insurance does not cover medical marijuana as a treatment option. Medicare most certainly will not provide for medicinal cannabis as it is a federally governed and regulated program. And as a federally illegal substance, hospice can forbid the use of cannabis within its facility. In fact, hospice may lose its funding if it is found to be dispensing a federally illegal substance to its patients. 

Therefore, while theoretically a Nevada patient in hospice could use medicinal cannabis if he or she had a patient card and could legally obtain the medicine (most likely through a caregiver), most patients in hospice facilities will not be provided medical cannabis as a part of their end of life treatment. ]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Elevating the Conversation with State Senator Patricia Farley</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nevada State Senator Patricia Farley of District 8 was swept into office in November 2014 as part of the Republican landslide and finished her first year serving in the Nevada State Legislate this past June. The Arizona native is still surprised she won, remarking that, “If you told me two years ago that people would be calling me Senator, I would have said you have lost your mind.”

<h3>WHAT BENEFITS DO YOU SEE THE MEDICAL CANNABIS INDUSTRY BRINGING TO THE STATE? </h3>
It’s two-fold, I think there is a medical purpose. There are just too many stories out there that you hear about its effectiveness. From that standpoint, I think it should be controlled but accessible.

It also has the potential to be a huge economic driver for the state and Nevada could certainly use an economic boom. When I got involved with it during the session, it was hard to overlook all the economic successes other states were having, such as Colorado, and all the jobs it was creating. They are not low-skilled jobs either, so that is huge. 

The other thing that got my attention is we had a mini-economic boom going on and no one could quite put their finger on and it was build-outs , TIs, contracts, supplies, and hydroponics. By the time we got into session we were already seeing the economic impact of the medical marijuana industry. Once we peeled back the onion a little bit, we could see who has behind it. I think it’s important to the state’s economy that we keep it going. 

<h3>WOULD YOU CHANGE ANYTHING ABOUT SB 374 WHICH PROVIDED THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR MMES? </h3>
Of course hindsight is 20/20, but I think that with any new industry, it probably would have been a good idea to get commissions and councils started to look at the issues and do a few more case studies. That’s why we formed the Nevada Marijuana Council -- to give us a 360-degree view of the legislation so there isn’t so much misinterpretation and unintended consequences. 

<h3>ASSEMBLY BILL 480 CREATED THRIFTS TO ADDRESS THE BANKING ISSUES OF MMES. WHAT’S THE LATEST NEWS?</h3>
We have made a lot of progress. I would say we are at the 75 percent mark for getting an application, a board, insurance, and compliance with the FDIC. We are moving that ball down the field very aggressively. I hope we have an application turned in by January and we have systems and insurance that will meet not only state, but also federal requirements. 

<h3>DO YOU THINK IN 10 YEARS THE STIGMA MARIJUANA WILL BE A THING OF THE PAST AND CANNABIS WILL BE THOUGHT OF AS LEGITIMATE MEDICINE? </h3>
I think we are halfway there now. Sixty-one percent of people in Nevada support medical marijuana. When you talk to physicians, there are huge names in the medical industry getting behind the use of medical marijuana. The stigma might be held by the minority and not the majority. 

<h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK THE CHANCES ARE THAT NEVADA VOTERS WILL PASS IP1 (ADULT USE) NEXT YEAR? </h3>
I think it will pass. I am not supportive one way or the other. I have been very honest about my feelings on this. I get the medical piece of it, but the recreational aspect is like alcohol, I guess. But I don’t think peoplewho have never used marijuana are going to go out and start using it because it’s legal.]]></content:encoded>

<h2>ILLINOIS</h2>
<p>More than two years after Illinois enacted its medical cannabis law, growers began shipping their products to dispensaries around the state in preparation for patients to buy medical cannabis legally for the first time on November 9. Illinois has 3,300 patients approved for the program who are able to procure medical cannabis from eight licensed dispensaries. The dispensaries will grow to 25 by the end of the year. A statewide digital tracking system has been launched to prevent any diversion of cannabis to the black market.</p>

<h2>OHIO</h2> 
<p>Voters rejected a ballot proposal, Issue 3, on November 3 that would have legalized both recreational and medical cannabis in Ohio. Approximately 65 percent of voters opposed the measure, compared to 35 percent in favor. Issue 3 would have allowed adults 21 and older to use, purchase or grow certain amounts of cannabis and would have allowed others to use it as medicine. The proposal’s framework stated that growing facilities were to be controlled by a network of 10 private investors, leading opponents to label it a “marijuana monopoly.” Issue 3 was the only cannabis legalization question on statewide ballots in 2015.</p>

 <h2>PENNSYLVANIA</h2>
<p>In late October more than 60 Pennsylvania religious leaders announced their support for medical cannabis legislation. The clergy members signed a statement urging state lawmakers to adopt a comprehensive medical marijuana law this year. A portion of the statement read: “We cannot remain silent while people in pain and anguish are deprived of a viable, safe, and responsible remedy. While we may practice different faiths and come from different communities, we share the same commitment to improving the broader community through the practice of humanity, healing, mercy, and compassion.” The Pennsylvania Senate approved a medical cannabis bill, SB 3, by a vote of 40-7 in May, and it is awaiting consideration in the House.</p>

<h2>NEW JERSEY</h2>
<p>In November New Jersey lawmakers on the state legislature’s judiciary committee heard from various clergy, health professionals and law enforcement officials to consider legislation to legalize recreational marijuana use in the state. The hearing came as lawmakers prepared for a lame-duck session of the Legislature and as Governor Chris Christie, who is anti-cannabis, spends time outside New Jersey campaigning for the Republican nomination for president. New Jersey’s medical marijuana law is among the most restrictive in the nation, with patients and doctors required to register with the state and each pay a $200 fee. There are five medical marijuana dispensaries open and a sixth is pending.</p>

<h2>WASHINTON, D.C.</h2> 
Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) introduced a bill in November that would repeal all federal penalties for possessing and growing cannabis, allowing states to establish their own cannabis laws. The “Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2015” strikes all references to marijuana in the Controlled Substances Act, but retains penalties for transporting marijuana from states or jurisdictions where it is legal to those where it is not. It is the fourth marijuana policy reform bill to ever be introduced in the Senate, and it is the first that proposes ending marijuana prohibition at the federal level.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Elevate NV canvassed leaders in the Nevada MME (medical marijuana establishment) industry for their 2016 prognostications regarding cannabis. We asked them to look deep into their crystal balls to make some predictions about what they thought the year would bring to Southern Nevada’s patients and business owners. Without fail, most had high hopes for the passage of adult use cannabis in November, as well that medicinal options would explode and supply would stabilize. We welcome your cannabis predictions too, so please share them with us at info@elevatenv.com. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cannabis ballot initiatives are going to determine the next president of the United States. Florida, Ohio, Nevada, Arizona, California, Massachusetts, Maine -- if we have ballot initiatives in every one of those states, what do they do? They drive our youth voters like nothing else does. Youth voters skew dramatically in one direction or the other. These ballot initiatives will bring out the youth vote in unexpected numbers and those ballot initiatives will effect the vote for every other office that’s on the ballot. Cannabis is going to determine our next president.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Delivery will be very important and the initial success of medical marijuana in Las Vegas will require businesses to navigate the complicated patchwork of local delivery restrictions. If a business is able to capture significant market share in the delivery space early that will mean profitable returns for years to come. Logistics and the technology of delivery will be the next big opportunity for Nevada in 2016.</p>

  <p>I predict ip1 will pass overwhelmingly and the legislature will vote to speed up its implementation so recreational will start on July 1, 2017 instead of January 1, 2018.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With ballot initiatives and legislative action in Nevada and a number of other states, I predict we will reach a tipping point and Congress will be forced to take action to protect patients, doctors, and businesses from federal prosecution; support marijuana-related research; and expand financial services 
to the industry.</p>
  <footer>Dina Titus, <cite title="Source Title">Congresswoman (NV-1) </cite></footer>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The beneficial effects of the stringent regulations imposed by the state of Nevada on the state's medical marijuana enterprises will increasingly be recognized as patients benefit from having the safest, cleanest, most well-defined cannabis available to them. As other states continue to adopt stringent testing standards related to such things as pesticide and microbial testing, which were first made mandatory in Nevada, Nevada will increasingly be recognized as having establishing the "gold standard" for cannabis testing. Nevada politicians will work to foster an environment which allows clinical patient research and be at the forefront of clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of medicinal cannabis for a variety of common medical ailments.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 2016, I predict that there will be a significant increase in the number of Nevada patients and an increase in the number of out-of-state patients served by the many dispensaries that will open; however, some of the companies that were granted provisional licenses will not successfully open a medical marijuana establishment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We at the County have already issued 24 medical marijuana business licenses.

<blockquote>
<p>Sales will skyrocket in the summer as more dispensaries open, creating significant problems in the businesses trying to operate on a cash-only basis.

<p>I think adult use will pass in November because a casino operator will decide to donate to a non-profit instead of going against the ballot initiative. I also have it on good authority that Elevate magazine will expand into other states looking to elevate the conversation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nevada’s newly minted marijuana industry entrepreneurs and their investors will breathe a sigh of relief as they begin to reap the rewards of two years of hard work and sacrifice.

<blockquote>
<p>The state will start an online process to shorten the time it takes for patients to get their medical marijuana cards.

<p>Adult use marijuana is approved by voters in November 2016. Total sales from medical marijuana in Nevada will top $100 million in 2016. The first Nevada state-chartered marijuana banking facility opens in the second quarter of 2016.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>On a greater scale, once MMEs have passed the startup phase of business, I think there will be a great social and economic opportunity for industry leaders to look externally from their own operations and shoulder the responsibility for positive change in Nevada. </p>
<p>I see 2016 being a significant year for social and political acceptance. I think the initial public safety concerns are going to be significantly mitigated as our community recognizes the cannabis industry for both its medical and economic contributions. I also see strong growth within the industry, as the supply will become closer to meeting demand mid-year.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Acclaimed for its secret dish of the same name, Killer Shrimp has made its way to Las Vegas, opening a location at Town Square in late 2015. “Las Vegas was a logical choice because it’s so accessible as well as being a world-class destination,” explained Kevin Michaels, CEO of Killer Shrimp, of opening the first Killer Shrimp outside of California.

From 1988 until 2008, the restaurant’s eponymous dish was so wildly popular it was the only entree the restaurant served. It may be so coveted because Michaels and his family have kept the secret spices used to make the dish a closely guarded secret. “The guys in the kitchen don’t even know what goes into the spice profile,” he said, noting that “people love trying to guess what’s in it.” 

In spite of its wild success, Killer Shrimp expanded its menu in 2008 to 60 items but to this day 50 percent of  what it sells is still its spicy shellfish dish served by itself or over either rice or angel hair pasta.  

The new restaurant is pleased to now share its Killer Shrimp with Las Vegas and is even more pleased to offer the state’s medical cannabis patients a discount. Patients who show their medical marijuana card can receive a 20% discount off of their check in January. Michaels feels strongly about taking care of medical marijuana patients because he has a personal connection.

“Twice I have seen it really impact people in my life in a big way -- that’s my whole connection,” he relayed. “My mom passed away in 2007 from pancreatic cancer. My mother was a very health-driven person and never smoked pot. But she was so sick that toward the later stages we talked her into trying it.

“Watching your mom go through that and seeing the magic of it and how it gave her a new lease on life and get some enjoyment and be able to smile again, it was a very positive thing. Marijuana would give her a little bit of relief.”

And in its own small way, Killer Shrimp is also hoping to give Nevada medical marijuana patients a little relief – just a whole lot tastier.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple of years ago, the medical marijuana industry in nevada looked like the wild west. Patients were theoretically permitted to buy and use cannabis products for a variety of ailments, but there wasn’t a clear legal avenue to acquire the medicine from legitimate dealers. Those patients relied on a sort of gray market that included dozens of dealers who would deliver their product direct to the patients – mostly avoiding law enforcement along the way.

That legal chaos was supposed to end with legislation that was passed and signed into law in 20ı3 when SB 374, which created the framework for the state’s medical marijuana industry, was signed into law.

Highly regulated brick-and-mortar cultivation and production sites with storefront dispensaries were authorized. Stringent licensing and testing requirements meant that those owning the new facilities would sell standardized product, similar to what medical patients would get when buying other kinds of pharmaceuticals. And other requirements, such as a hefty $250,000 proof-of-financial viability rule, would keep fly-by-night dealers out of the business.

The rules appear to have worked as licensed dispensaries and regulated cultivation and production sites started appearing all over Nevada’s Clark and Washoe counties in 20ı5. But there is a flaw in this cannabis ointment.

Those unlicensed, unregulated and fundamentally illegal delivery dealers didn’t go away. In fact, a couple of years ago you could go online and find about two-dozen delivery services, most of them apparently careful to deliver only to people with medical marijuana cards. Today, despite the new laws authorizing licensed and legal dispensaries, the number of delivery dealers on the popular Weedmaps website stands at more than 50.

Those distributors not only avoid the onerous licensing requirements, including the financial viability and ongoing laboratory testing rules, but they can get product outside Nevada’s legal supply chain, undercutting the legal prices while making fatter profits. In short, the legal and licensed business owners fear that the illegal distributors threaten the very survival of Nevada’s nascent but growing medical cannabis industry. 

“They are out-competing other dispensaries, but they are completely violating every part of the law,” says Will Adler, executive director of the Nevada Medical Marijuana Association, a trade group representing the licensed dispensaries. His voice reflects his frustration with the unlicensed competition. “It is not just petty drug dealing. It is violating every part of the law and pretending to have a legal product. That is why it is so destructive.”

While competition in most areas is a good thing, unregulated commerce, in what is fundamentally intended as medicine, is not, Adler emphasizes. 

Nevada’s regulated system of cultivation, production and dispensaries is designed to give patients confidence in the strength, quality and characteristics of the product that they use. 

“Every step of the chain, every gram,” is accounted for in that process, Adler says. The point was to avoid the chaos that developed in other parts of the country, where cannabis products are sold without quality control and seemingly to everyone. “The Nevada system was to be the gold standard of the country, and still is.”

Three years ago, before the new laws were passed and the old laws were mired in contradiction over what was and wasn’t legal, defense attorneys told a reporter for the now-defunct CityLife magazine that the delivery services were largely getting a pass from law enforcement. Juries were reluctant to convict dealers who were providing medical marijuana patients with a legal product. 

Now Metro Police and the Clark County District Attorney not only have the laws standardizing the industry, but the legal, licensed dispensaries have significant political and financial resources, assets that can be helpful in motivating law enforcement to go after the delivery services. Regardless of motivation, that is exactly what is happening. 

“Year to date,” said officer Michael Rodriquez, a Metro spokesman, of 20ı5, “Metro has investigated ı9 illegal delivery services. Of those investigations, nine have resulted in search warrants and arrests.”

In 20ı4, Metro investigated just two illegal marijuana delivery services (both of which resulted in felony convictions). 

The 850 percent increase in investigations isn’t accidental.

“In 20ı4, the Southern Nevada Cannabis Operations and Regional Enforcement (SCORE) focus was more on indoor marijuana grows,” Rodriquez said in an email, referring to the illegal cultivation facilities sometimes tucked into residential neighborhoods. “In 20ı5, the focus has changed to illegal marijuana delivery services.”

Those who operate the unlicensed deliveries, unsurprisingly, are less than enthusiastic about the shift in focus. Elevate talked to one young entrepreneur who, in 20ı5, relocated from California to Nevada to run a business in Las Vegas.

His product comes from California. The businessman, who asked that his name and the name of his Weedmaps-advertised business not be disclosed for fear that Metro would scrutinize his activities, said that just like the legally authorized dispensaries in Nevada, he is concerned about providing a high-quality product to medical marijuana patients. 

He says he ensures that his customers have valid medical marijuana cards. He also says that although his extensive selection of products – which includes dozens of varieties of sativa, indica, and many edible products, with suggested medical applications – says online that it has not been tested for the quantity and potency of active ingredients, he has in fact had those products tested. 

“I want the best product possible,” he says. “We do lab test every one of our products. I’m not here just to make money,” he says. “I’m trying to do the right thing. I’m trying to start a large business. But you have to start somewhere.”

He refers to the rules that require extensive financial resources and the limited number of licenses for production sites and dispensaries: “It’s almost impossible to do it the right way.”

And he argues that in addition to providing products that are as potent as the licensed dispensaries, his access to the California wholesale market, his suppliers, means he can sell products for less than the licensed competition in the brick-and-mortar dispensaries.

“The prices here – they are unheard of in California,” he says. His prices are perhaps $5 to $ı0 less than similar products at Nevada’s dispensaries. Dispensaries in California sell similar products at $ı0 to $20 less.

Adler and the licensed operators in Nevada say sure, the illegal delivery services can sell a less-expensive product, but without the state oversight, how do patients know what they are getting?

“They’ll undercut the price, go online, they’ll drop it lower and say, ‘Hey, we’ll deliver it to you too’,” Adler says. “They can get it in California far cheaper than in Nevada, but in Nevada you pay for getting a medically safe product. In California, it could be grown in somebody’s basement.

“They’re advertising it as if it were the same, but it’s something far worse,” he says. Adler says he hopes to see the laws and the law-enforcement response adapt to the new reality and put what he calls “street drug dealers” out of business. 

The licensed operators insist that it’s not about competition or profits, but the well-being of patients that they are concerned about. 

“Let’s talk about patients,” says Aesha Goins, with the licensed Nevada Wellness Center, a dispensary in Las Vegas. “We are tested, under scrutiny, our products are clean versus whatever they are selling.

“Nevada has done an excellent job. There are no pesticides, no fake growing material. You’re getting a good, true product. Number one, we’re concerned about the patient. That is our whole mindset.”

<p>Leslie Bocskor is a managing partner of Electrum Partners, founding chairman of the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association, and a member of ArcView Angel Investor Network. Having worked on the investment side of the tech world, Bocskor’s interest turned to cannabis in 2012 when he began looking at data surrounding the industry. Following the election later that year that made adult use legal in Colorado and Washington, Bocskor explained “the writing was on the wall and that was when I knew there was something very substantial happening and I was certain it was going to be enormous.”

        After I moved here, as soon as I figured out that there was a medical marijuana law, I read it. Only because in New York where I am from, medical marijuana was that thing they do in California, and it would have been the butt of a joke. It wasn’t anything anyone took seriously on the East Coast. I went to Colorado in 2009, I saw friends of mine that were involved in the burgeoning medical marijuana industry and this idea of there being an actual business was very interesting to me. So when I saw that there was a law on the books in Nevada, I read it, I saw that it was incomplete, that it allowed for use but not sale or transfer of any sort so there was no possibility of a market, but it got me familiar with it. 

So much so that when my friend Joe Brezny (editor’s note: Brezny is now with the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol), who I was collaborating with on a technology project, told me to pay attention to what’s going on with cannabis I thought, ‘Oh, Joe, you are just hopeful because you want to see this issue come to the forefront. And he said, ‘Oh, no, no, no there’s going to be a big market here. It’s going to be enormous.’ So I started looking at the data around 2012 and it started to look more compelling. Then the election of 2012 happened where Colorado and Washington made adult use legal and to me that was the writing on the wall. And that was when I knew there was something very substantial happening and I was certain it was going to be enormous and Joe was right and I told him he was right and I thanked him for getting me in the business. So it really started around the winter of 2012, beginning of 2013.

      <div class="panel-body">
        Yes, as a matter of fact it has. During the session of 2013, Joe Brezny reached out to me and said let’s talk about this. He and I started talking about Tick’s medical marijuana dispensary law, which is what we were calling it at the time, which was making its way through the session. In whatever small way I could, I tried to help in building consensus by using the little political capital I had built up. We tried to do what we could to make sure that everyone was on the same page about this – the activists as well as the businesspeople. With my background in banking, corporate finance and entrepreneurialism, I suggested that what we should be doing was bringing as much best practices from other businesses as possible to help the state in developing the industry and the industry in developing itself. 

So during the session, Joe and I were probably spending 10 to 20 hours a week together on this project. As we know, it only passed by one vote and that was (Nevada Assemblywoman) Michelle Fiore who crossed party lines to make the difference. The fact that it passed by one vote meant that every little bit helped and that everybody provided. 

Has it unfolded as I would have expected? In fact, it’s unfolded even better than I thought it would. Many people are very critical and they point out all the shortcomings, I would say having studied this on a national basis and an international basis, whether you look at what’s happened in Holland, Israel, Canada, and their missteps and you look at the laws and missteps of Massachusetts, Colorado, Washington, Arizona, Oregon, New York, Florida, Michigan, Illinois, they have all had really rough goes of it. 

When you take a look on a purely objective perspective and evaluate first off how transparent and fair is the regulatory framework in Nevada? Well arguably it’s the most transparent and fair framework that yet has been devised, and thorough. Why is that? Well, because Nevada has a history of being able to establish a regulatory framework for things that have been looked at as taboo in other jurisdictions and the history goes back decades. We have been through it and had it gone wrong and figured out how to do it right. 

Then people were complaining about how long it took. I understand, we wanted it to happen faster. Nobody wanted it to happen faster than I did as Chairman of the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association, and someone who has interests here in Nevada, and as someone who has interest in seeing Nevada develop its presence on a national basis. I, of course, wanted to see it move quickly. That being said, slow is better than fast, patience is power. And now the fact that we have the best regulatory framework, the best testing standards, the best quality cannabis being produced here in Nevada, of anywhere in the world, because our testing is more strict than anywhere else. 

You can be sure what you are getting when you buy cannabis from a Nevada dispensary and that it’s going to be a clean product. We should be so fortunate as to have our food tested to the same level that our cannabis is here in Nevada. And so, how has it unfolded? It’s unfolded better than I could have expected to be quite honest.

    <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="headingThree">
      <div class="panel-body">
        When I first was doing this, I made a lot more comparisons because you could easily make that comparison that it was the birth of a new industry and the explosive growth that comes along with that but actually, at this point, I am more likely to contrast the tech industry and cannabis industry than compare them. What we are experiencing right now with cannabis is really unique in the history of business across the globe. And why is that? What makes it so unique? We aren’t just talking about adult use cannabis, which is a big component, but it’s not just that.

Adult use cannabis, according to Rand Corp., in 2010 with a 10-year look back, was $50 billion dollars a year. MLB, NBA, NFL, and NHL together represent about $35 billion dollars a year in revenue; illegal cannabis adult use in 2010 represented $50 billion dollars a year in revenue. So that gives you an idea of the scope. Let’s do that contrast. When the Internet and new media was really born back in the mid- to late ‘90s there was no internet yet, there was no industry, nobody knew what was going to happen. When Jeff Bezos was saying he was going to start something called Amazon and sell books on the internet people would say: What is the Internet? And why would I ever buy a book there?

And so there was this great uncertainty in terms of how big it would get, which is why people like Paul Krugman in 1998 said that the Internet was a fad and that no one would ever make any money there. Because nobody really knew and it was the same reason why people said Amazon would go out of business by 2000, which obviously they didn’t. And why all sorts of other predictions wouldn’t happen and there was a reason for that, there was an uncertainty, nobody knew…would we ever be able to get consumers to start using the internet like they do now? Would they buy books? Would they buy homes? Would they buy cars, book movies, communicate with all their co-workers, would they set up software platforms on the internet to manage businesses? We didn’t know that. It had never been done before. So how could we say it? 

But we do know that people: #1) use cannabis recreationally on a global basis and we know they spend a lot of money doing it. #2) we know that they use it for medical marijuana, which is a new industry, but it’s been growing. We also know that industrial hemp is a gigantic market, we don’t even know how big it was because the illegality of it has crushed an industry that is probably in the tens of millions of dollars. What do I mean? I mean, industrial hemp for paper. Hemp uses something like 25% of the water and produces something like 1/10 of the toxic waste that a pulp paper mill does. Plus, we can have 2 harvests of hemp a year in a place that takes 20 years to grow the trees to yield similar amounts of paper from hemp. We can use hemp for textiles and, once again it uses much less water than cotton and is better for remediating the soil and it doesn’t have as much toxic waste produced in processing it. We can also use it for fuel. You can make hemp bio fuel. You can also use it for making plastic and people don’t know that. Henry Ford made a car in the early 1900s where part of it was made from hemp plastic and soy plastic. Once again, it’s not nearly as toxic. Remember, hemp is above the ground and plastics these days are from petro chemicals below the ground which work against us in the overall carbon emissions issue because you are getting carbon out of the ground and putting it in above the ground. 

Then, there’s pharmaceuticals. We have been keeping the cannabis plant out of being a derivative ever since there has been a pharmaceutical industry in the United States, since the early 1900s.So what I am saying is that the contrast between cannabis and the tech industry is that the cannabis industry is far larger than we anticipated. It is so large, it is probably in the hundreds of billions of dollars once it matures. Sure the tech industry is in that number now, 15 or 20 years later, but my point is that the time it will take to grow, and the uncertainty, isn’t there. What I mean specifically is when you take a black market industry and move it into a regulated market you don’t have the same uncertainty around consumer behavior because what we are doing is we are taking a market right now where you have to put your personal freedom at risk, you might get arrested for buying it or selling it, you certainly have a significant amount of inconvenience associated with it because you gotta go meet some guy on a street corner or someone’s home or God knows how else you buy it on the black market, but when you contrast it with a licensed store with policies or if there’s a recall you will be able to look at the serial number and say, ‘Oh, mine was recalled’ and give it back, there’s no comparison. 

People buy cannabis on the black market and they don’t know whether it’s been sprayed with paraquat or DDT or what. Anything could be on it. They have no idea. So as soon as you make it a regulated market that is much easier and much more comfortable for consumers and you take this already existing $50-billion-a-year market, it’s going to explode and double in size quickly. Why? Because so many people are currently sitting on the fence because they have used it in the past in high school or college but are scared to break the law or take the risk to get something they don’t know about. But if you can go to a store like a liquor store and just look and read reviews and find out test results -- all of sudden it’s a completely different experience. 

In the birth of a new industry, its similar in terms of what happens with the entrepreneurs and things start to bubble to the surface but the contrast is much more significant now than the comparison was when I first was looking at it. Contrast in how quickly it is going to grow, contrast in how much less risk there is, contrast in how quickly businesses become profitable. 

For example, another fact that came out of the MMJ Business Daily Fact Book in 2015 is that half of the businesses started in the legal cannabis industry are profitable or break even within a year. And that’s never happened for any industry in the history of the world. 

Also, there’s the federal illegality that is keeping big players out. See you can’t have the Pfizers and Johnson & Johnson, CVS Pharmacy, Anheuser-Busch, whoever it might be, they can’t come in and crush the small guy with their wallet because they are prevented from coming into the industry. Plus, it’s regionalized so you can’t do interstate commerce so that means each state is like its own market which presents entrepreneurs in that state with opportunities that they haven’t had in any other type of industry in any other time in the recent past. So the contrasting points from a business perspective are much more significant to me now than the comparison.

        That it is real because up until the moment that they open there’s still this question because it is still federally illegal. This is really happening, we are seeing change. What does that mean? That means fewer arrests for ridiculous things. That means tax revenue is going to be generated for our schools and for law enforcement and for substance abuse counseling that is so needed in this state. It means jobs are plentiful. It means keeping the hard won treasure of Nevada in Nevada. Money was leaving the Nevada economy and going into the Mexican economy to criminal gangs who murdered American law enforcement agents and we were funding them with the black market. And now, once we have the dispensaries open, that money is going to be kept in Nevada rather going into a black market that is leaving the state. It’s all that money not leaving our economy and being siphoned off into a criminal economy. And people not getting arrested which means not burdening Nevada taxpayers because every time somebody got arrested for cannabis, there is a cost associated with that arrest: sending them to court costs money, putting them in jail costs money, keeping them in jail for a period of time costs money, and who pays for that? The Nevada taxpayers. And so that burden being eliminated is also fantastic. And knowing Nevada consumers now are going to be able to get things that have been tested. The dispensaries opening made that real and, also, knowing that we are going to keep it out of the hands of kids. So if you ask me why I am happy it’s because all of those things are becoming real with the opening of the dispensaries.

        Truly, it has been a combination of two things -- and that is profitability and values. First, it has a value system that has developed and made it so as an industry, the conversation is how can we be exemplary? How can we do the right things every step of the way? How can we not have our profitability compromise our values? And the fact that it is such a prominent part of the conversation at all of the meetings and all of the conferences is such an important part of it. Values are trumping profitability. You just don’t hear about that, it just doesn’t happen. 

The other surprise is the profitability. Maybe the reason we can think about our values is because the industry is so profitable. Maybe because 52% of businesses in the legal cannabis industry hit break-even or profitability in the first six months, that’s unheard of. It leaves me speechless at times when I start to think about the consequences of that. So it is the profitability of the industry combined with it being managed by the values that are being established in terms of how operators in this business behave. And you see people come into this business and they say they are just here for the money and then six months later they are talking about values and they are talking about the importance of doing the right thing. 

Once again it is this convergence of forces, being able to do the right thing, know that you are fighting for a social justice cause, and knowing that you are making the world a better place, and knowing that you are taking part in establishing sensible policy that is leading to compassion and fewer people’s lives being destroyed and leading to access to something that will make people’s lives better, and, you are able to do it profitably. I meet other entrepreneurs who literally say, ‘I have to pinch myself because it feels like this is a dream.’

        I didn’t actually start it. It was Joe Brezny who started it. He would probably say we started it together. But I am going to give credit where credit is due. It was his idea. He recognized the value of having an industry association help to establish a thoughtful, well-regulated industry because he has worked in that space before. I helped start it but it was really his idea. My initial role was to find a founding chairman because that was such an important role. I reached out to several key players and thought leaders in the industry and they all said, ‘I would be happy to be a part of the board and be one of the founding members but founding chairman? No, it’s too much of a lightening-rod role. I can’t take the optical risk or the social, political or business risk.’ After trying to find the founding chairman for three months, Joe turned me to me and, ‘Leslie, everybody else is chicken shit. Would you do it?’ And I have been very pleased to get that trade association up and running here in the state.

        One, outside ownership is allowed, two, for-profit entities are allowed. So right there, the only other states you can really compare us to are Oregon and Washington. But you can’t really compare us to Washington because medical marijuana isn’t even regulated. Colorado is regulated but not that well-regulated. But right away you can’t have outside ownership. And on the face of it, it looks like that is really good for Colorado. But no it’s not. Anytime you create regulations that put heavy-handed restrictions on a free market, you create an opportunity for mischief because people are still going to try to find a way to participate in the market. You are just inviting people to break laws and find ways to violate the spirit of it which is why Colorado is already looking to unwind their restriction on ownership from being a Colorado resident. 

So first off, no residency requirement. Secondly, making the licensing process a merit-based process where you have to be thoroughly vetted by the state and you have to really show that you put together all of the components to have a qualified team and enterprise. The licensing process was a transparent one. The state had issued the requirements, and the scoring schema being published prior to licenses being completed was also really well done.  

Reciprocity. Let’s talk about Hawaii and New York for a minute. New York just issued five licenses, Hawaii is about to issue eight. Both have substantial tourist trades. New York is comparable to Nevada and Hawaii certainly. The idea of saying we recognize that marijuana is medicine, and that we are going to set up a medical marijuana program and we also are a very big tourist destination and we want you to come visit our state and we are going to make you break the law if you are a medical marijuana user and a tourist coming to our state so you either have to buy it on the black market when you get here or you have to travel with it illegality. To me that is just patently absurd. It’s just bad policy. And the fact that Nevada has what I would consider sensible policy around reciprocity, that’s as clearly articulated as it is, just, once again, puts us head and shoulders beyond the rest.

Then you add the transfer of ownership being done in the way that it is being done. Look at our testing requirements as to how strict Nevada is compared to everywhere else and now people are starting to copy us. That is the surest sign that we are doing something right is when other jurisdictions are looking to Nevada and think maybe our state should start to do something like Nevada did. 

So if I had to pin it on a couple of things, it would be the licensing process, the transparency associated with it, the basic underlying components of that licensing process, for-profit entities, no residency requirement, merit-based system, and reciprocity for the patients that travel here. And then the fact that Nevada is so good at regulating things that would be taboo in other jurisdictions, giving us a leg up on everybody else.

        I think that we will see a Nevada financial institution created under the special Thrift provision that was amended to the law in the last session. We will see a Nevada financial institution that will be doing business with legal cannabis in-state and out-of-state eventually but not exclusively cannabis businesses, a small percentage of them. We will see a Nevada financial institution able to do what the Four Corners Credit Union in Colorado wasn’t able to do. I thought they should not be calling themselves a cannabis credit union but calling themselves an agriculture credit union and primarily go after the agriculture market in Colorado and then have 5 percent of that be agriculture and I think that the Fed would have absolutely given them their master Fed number if they had done that. The reason the Fed has not given them their master fed number, from what I understand, is the concentration of risk. If you created a credit union that worked exclusively in adult entertainment or in gaming or any other industry that is considered high risk, the fed would have said you are concentrating your risk, you are working only in that one industry and that way you are exposing your shareholders and the banking system to the risk of one thing. I think we will see a financial institution learn from the mistakes of Four Corners Federal Credit Union. I think in the first or second quarter you will see some substantial activity and the possibility of banking not just in Nevada but in the whole country for businesses that are the best of breed for the industry. In the 2nd quarter you will see an industry-based solution for banking that is going to come as a result of legislation.

       I think it will take longer than 10 years to get rid of the stigma. A substantial amount of it will be gone in 10 years but probably for years to come there will always be some stigma associated with it because you can’t have nearly 80 years of propaganda that’s not going to have some lasting effect. I think at the same time it will be thought of as a legitimate medicine. It will be thought of as a legitimate medicine when there is a mass market product in the United States that is cannabis based that serves a mass condition like diabetes or arthritis or is used for cancer treatments in a much more widely prescribed fashion and doctors across the country can prescribe something based upon it, that’s when you will see it thought of as a legitimate medicine.

The wholesale market is not allowed to exist, there’s no testing that’s done, and it is still sort of seedy. So I think other cities are going to say we are going to become the Las Vegas of… for instance, Anchorage will say we are going to be the Las Vegas of Alaska. I would say we are going to blow right by Amsterdam because we are going to be doing it so much better, and it’s going to be so much cleaner, or well regulated and so much more friendly to the consumer. Pretty soon Amsterdam will say they want to become the Las Vegas of Europe.

        I think it’s very likely that it will pass. I think every Nevadan really needs to think about it and consider that this is the only effective way to keep it out of the hands of kids and that this is the best way to provide tax revenue for substance abuse counseling, for law enforcement, and for education. Nevada is 50th in the United States for public education. We are going to provide tax revenue that’s going to help our kids to get a better education while keeping cannabis out of their hands while establishing a regulated framework that’s going to lower the burden on our court system and treat this from a regulated perspective the way alcohol has been. If every citizen of Nevada has an honest conversation about that and looks at the facts, what they are going to realize is that it’s the only solution and it will pass by a very wide margin. We can’t come at this as activists, but as realists.

Also, you will probably be seeing cannabis pairings suggested with dinners in fine restaurants; it will just be a matter of time before there will be the reds, the whites and the greens.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In any emerging industry, steady leadership and proven business acumen are necessities for success. And that has never been more true as it has been in Nevada’s medical cannabis industry, which has undergone such a complex regulatory process to ensure safety for patients.

Demetri Kouretas, owner and CEO of The Grove, has been an entrepreneur and business innovator for decades, having managed international import/export businesses, overseen full-scale industrial and real estate ventures, and successfully launching and operating numerous gaming and restaurant establishments. 

Kouretas and his team have taken the commitment to providing the highest quality, all-natural medicines very seriously, carefully examining every aspect of the business and its operations.

“Rather than trying to be the first to market, we have chosen to take the time necessary to ensure that the product The Grove produces and sells is going to be the best alternative for those who are seeking relief,” Kouretas said. “It matters to us that everything we provide is natural and truly effective.”

“We have built a team of experts who bring an incredible depth of knowledge and are applying it to our operation. We have folks from the medical, horticultural, and even culinary and oil industry applying their talents to a new frontier and we all are excited to educate and inform new patients.”

Importantly, The Grove will have control throughout the process, from the seedlings in its grow facility, through cultivation and production, to two dispensaries where clients can obtain their medicine. The Grove is dedicated to curating its selection of strains so it can not only offer those that are most in demand by its clients, but also those that are difficult to find and highly sought after.

The Grove’s state-of-the-art, eco-friendly indoor grow and production facility will create pure medical marijuana, concentrates and edibles. The company strives to honor all-natural growing principles with every plant it grows, and with the help of its experienced master grower, The Grove has designed an ecosystem that mimics the growth conditions found in nature. All-natural soil, along with purely natural means of controlling pests and fungus, will be used at The Grove’s grow facility.

The Grove will operate two dispensaries in Nevada. The Las Vegas location is at 4640 Paradise Road, facing Swenson and across from the Thomas & Mack at UNLV. This location will be convenient for both locals and tourists, as it is moments from McCarran Airport and just a few blocks from The Strip. The Grove will have the only licensed dispensary in Nye County, as well, 
at 1541 E. Basin Ave, in Pahrump.

Burgoo is traditionally a southern stew using all the leftover meats and veggies that weren’t good enough to stand on their own. So when tasked with making a healthy yet flavorful recipe for Elevate Nevada, I wanted to offer a hearty recipe that could also conveniently utilize all the holiday leftovers in your fridge. Thoughtful, I know. 

I highly encourage you to use any leftover turkey, ham, chicken, sausage, and beef for the proteins. You can also use any leftover vegetables -- just make sure to add all of the precooked ingredients at the end. 

[one_half]
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
Makes 8 servings
2 lbs. pork shoulder
2 lbs. chicken legs, thighs, breast
2 lbs. beef chuck roast
1 green pepper 
1 Serrano pepper
1 large onion 
5 celery stalks
2 carrots (peeled) 
4 kale stalks
5 garlic cloves
1 qt. chicken stock
1 qt. beef stock
28 oz. crushed red tomatoes
1 lb. red potatoes cubed
1 lb. corn 
1 lb. lima beans
6 Tbs. Worcestershire sauce
salt/pepper to taste


[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>DIRECTIONS: </h3>
Heat a large pot on high with oil. Season the meats with salt and pepper, and brown them on all sides. Remove from heat and set aside in a separate dish. Using the large pot with oil in it, add celery, onion, carrot and peppers and sauté until slightly browned. (Optional: add a shot of Bourbon) and then add the garlic and sauté another 30 seconds.Add the meats into the pot as well as the chicken and beef stock and the crushed tomatoes. 

Mix thoroughly before 
you cover and let simmer for 2 hours. Remove the bones from the meat and add in the potatoes and kale. Cook for another 40 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. For the last 10 minutes of cooking, add corn and lima beans. 

<h3>ASSEMBLY:</h3>
Serve in a bowl with the bread of your preference. I used cornbread with a honey bourbon butter. For those that like it extra spicy, serve with Tabasco.

Since this is a soup and more than likely many people will be eating it, it would not be wise to put the cannabis infusion in the entire soup considering everyone’s dosage is unique. Not to mention if you add it too early, the THC, CBD and lovely terpenes will cook out at high temperatures. This infusion is best left to the individual bowl. I baked my cornbread with the cannabis infusion at 10mg apiece, but if you don’t have time to make your own bread then you can use cannabutter/oil and just put it straight into your bowl. Or you can let your portion of cannabutter come to room temperature and fold in honey and bourbon before spreading it on bread to dip in the soup. Add in your dosage to the bowl after you have poured it for yourself. The fats from the meats and the oils will help to homogenize the cannaoil in the soup. I recommend 10mg dosage at a time.

*Please remember that when cooking with medicinal cannabis you are cooking with a drug and the amounts of the drug and portions of the food ingested should always be taken into consideration. Always start out with small portions or doses and wait 30 minutes to an hour before eating any additional portions of food prepared with medical marijuana.

<h2>MINNESOTA</h2>
<p>Minnesota Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Ed Ehlinger announced the agency will expand its medical cannabis program next year to include patients suffering from intractable pain. The program, which started in July, allows patients suffering from a limited number of severe or fatal illnesses to use marijuana in a liquid or pill form. Dr. Ehlinger said a lack of firm scientific evidence about the benefits and risks made the call difficult, but the testimony of hundreds of Minnesotans made adding intractable pain as a qualifying condition the “right and compassionate” choice. Patients certified as suffering from intractable pain can receive medical marijuana starting in August 2016, Ehlinger said. </p>

<h2>ALASKA</h2> 
<p>The board tasked with writing rules for Alaska’s recreational marijuana industry voted to allow cannabis consumption in state-licensed pot shops in November. If approved by Lt. Gov. Byron Mallott, whose duties include filing and publishing state regulations, the Marijuana Control Board’s decision will make Alaska the first state with Amsterdam-style cannabis cafés and, in turn, becoming the first state to explicitly allow cannabis use in settings other than private residences. The 3-2 vote by the Marijuana Control Board (MCB) also changed the definition of the term “in public” to allow for consumption at some pot shops, none of which are open yet. It is still illegal to buy cannabis in Alaska because businesses have not yet been licensed to sell it. MCB is set to begin accepting business applications in February, with the initial industry licenses expected to be awarded in May.</p>

 <h2>CALIFORNIA</h2>
<p>San Francisco could soon be home to the largest medical marijuana dispensary in the country, according to SF Weekly. 
The publication reported that a three-story commercial building at 70 Second Street is for sale—along with the cannabis dispensary the building currently houses—and bids have topped $10 million. The astronomical bidding is because the property comes with the ability to operate a medical marijuana dispensary. The new owner could simply have the health permit transferred to his or her name.

<h2>MARYLAND</h2>
<p>It was reported in early December that Maryland will delay announcing the winners of medical cannabis business licenses for an undetermined amount of time, leaving entrepreneurs in a holding pattern and introducing uncertainty into the process, according to Marijuana Business Daily. The Natalie M. LaPrade Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission (MMCC) said it wants more time to review applications “due to the number of submissions received,” adding that it plans to issue an updated timeline “in the near future.” Previously, the commission had said it would announce license winners in January. In November, the commission received more 1,081 applications for marijuana dispensary, cultivation, processing and testing licenses. </p>

<h2>FLORIDA</h2> 
In November, the state’s Department of Health named five nurseries that will be allowed to grow non-euphoric cannabis for medicinal purposes under a law passed in 2014. Under the 2014 law, patients in need of medical cannabis were supposed to be able to obtain the substance in 2015 but lawsuits and red tape have caused delays. The cannabis strains that can be grown must contain a ratio of 10 percent or more cannabidiol (CBD), a substance that may help alleviate seizures, and 0.8 percent or less tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Under the law smoking cannabis is illegal, medical cannabis patients must medicate using an oil, through vaping or other non-smokeable means.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“It really destroyed my body,” Rich Holiday, 44, explains of the chemotherapy he received to treat his colon cancer in 2011. The construction worker, who is now on disability, opted for the traditional route to treat his cancer, receiving 12 rounds of chemotherapy.”

Despite the agonizing pain from neuropathy, panic attacks and insomnia caused by the chemotherapy, Rich was just relieved it worked and his cancer was eradicated. 

Then in December 2014 his cancer returned. Rich had started losing weight rapidly which was the first sign something was amiss. “I have always weighed 240. If I am losing weight there’s a problem,” he reveals. 

For his second bout with cancer, Rich explains, “I was going to do the chemo but my wife had been researching cannabis and Rick Simpson Oil and she brought it to my attention. My doctor wanted me to start chemo but this was a life and death decision we had to make. We weighed the pros and cons.”

One big strike in the con column was that Rich’s neighbor had just passed away from cancer and he had taken chemotherapy. Another con was his past chemo experience. 

“We knew chemo was going to do me in this time so it was between dying the bad way because the chemo hurts so bad, and it really messed me up the first time, or trying something different. Because what could they really do but give me double the dosage this time. We prayed on it and prayed on it,” explains Rich, for who, it ultimately came down to: “If I do pass, how do I want to pass? 

“So we went a different route,” explains Rich, whose wife started doing all the research on medical marijuana and encouraging him to apply for his patient card. Rich told his doctor he would do the surgery but wasn’t going to do chemotherapy and instead was going to try cannabis oil. 

His doctor tried to persuade him to use chemotherapy again, explaining that there is no research on whether cannabis oil works or not, and that Rich shouldn’t try something based on hearsay. But Rich’s mind was made up. “I told him that the research I did on chemo told me it was gonna kill me.”

Following his surgery in March 2015, Rich recalls telling “the doctors to just pray for us.” 

“Once I started taking medical marijuana I immediately could sleep,” Rich says of the first healing benefit from the cannabis oil he noticed. 

He also started to gain weight. “When I got out of surgery I was 208 and now I am at 232 lbs.”

Rich returned to his doctor this past November for a pet scan on his pelvis, neck and chest. When his doctor saw him he said to Rich, ‘I am going to tell you the truth, I was scared to see you again and scared to see what you were going to look like.’ 

Not only does Rich look healthy, more importantly, he is healthy. His pet scan came back clean. “I am blessed. I feel good. Whatever I want to do, I can do now. 

“I put all my faith in this oil. I just wish I could have known about this before.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The notion that a name of an object does not reflect what it really is as put forth by William Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet applies not only to the tale of the star-crossed lovers, but also to cannabis strains. Much like the Montague name, the specific names of cannabis strains doesn’t matter – it is the actual composition of the medicine that is of the utmost importance.

The variety of names is a result of hybridization which has created an infinite number of strain possibilities. Cannabis strains are either pure or a hybrid mixture of Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica. Hybrid varieties are grown in order to intensify specific characteristics of the plant. The variety name, often coined by the grower, reflects certain traits of the plant such as smell, color, taste, or origin of the specific variety.

Hybrid varieties can also be used as a marketing tool to differentiate themselves from one another. Hybrid varieties tailored for medicinal purposes have been traditionally different than the varieties customized for the recreational market. The latter varieties have been genetically bred to have a higher concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) while the former varieties have a higher composition of other cannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD).

The genotype, or genetic makeup, and phenotype, the observable traits, work hand in hand to produce a wide spectrum of strains -- from pure sativa to pure indica and all imaginable combinations in between. The interaction of the genotype and the environment will produce a distinctive phenotype, such as the smell (terpenes), shape, color, and concentration of cannabinoids, of which there are over 80.   

<h2>The Breeding Ground</h2>
The breeding of Cannabis sativa (Latin for cultivated) and Cannabis indica (originally collected in India) produces a variety of different strains. Sativa is the slower growing, taller species with long branches and large narrow bladed leaves. Indica, on the other hand, is the shorter and bushier species, with wider leaflets. 

Traditionally sativa is known for its cerebral effects while indica for its sedative properties. Breeding requires pollination of the female cannabis plant with the male pollen. In order to create specific varieties, selective breeding methods are utilized. 

Once bred, the names and nomenclatures for the varieties traditionally have been given by the grower. Obviously, marketing has influenced this process with popular strains being produced. Distinctive and catchy strain names have been used in order to distinguish different varieties and to differentiate strains from one another.

But as a consumer, what do these varieties mean? Unfortunately there may be a significant difference in the composition of strains that bear the same name. This becomes very frustrating for the patient, as there is uncertainty in the medicine they are purchasing.  

This is also a big dilemma for recommending physicians. Most physicians are not familiar with cannabis products but even if they were knowledgeable about the various strains, the composition of the strains can be different. With the strict laboratory testing of medical cannabis in Nevada, strains will now offer consistency and breeding particulars because medicines will have the ratios and components printed on the label.  

<h2>THC, CBD, and Terpenes</h2>
Historically, especially during the clandestine years, growers were keen on producing strains with the highest concentration of THC, the psychoactive component, which was desired by consumers. 

With the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes and the medicinal properties of other cannabinoids (CBD) coming to light, more growers are beginning to focus some of their crops to breed high CBD:THC varieties. 

Furthermore, the specific terpene composition has opened the door for new strain varieties. Terpenes are the aromatic oil compounds secreted by the trichomes, which also produce cannabinoids, on the cannabis plant giving each plant its unique aroma. Laboratories have added terpene profiles to their reporting algorithm. Thus, a better scientific makeup of each strain is delineated. There appears to be a synergistic relationship (entourage effect) between cannabinoids and terpenes in the body. 

Both cannabinoids and terpenes bind to cannabinoid receptors in the body and affect neurotransmitters’ production, cannabinoid transportation into the brain, and chemical reaction at the cannabinoid receptors. Now, medical research has to catch up and decipher what role terpenes play in shaping this plant into medicine.  

<h2>A Rose by Any Other Name...</h2>
As a physician, it’s not so much the name of a medical cannabis variety that is important but rather its actual composition. Research of specific varieties will be necessary to fully understand the efficacy of cannabis for specific aliments being treated. Future research will be a key factor in understanding, optimizing and expanding this fledgling field.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine yourself for a moment hanging upside down from a silk fabric suspended from high ceilings. You could be in either one of two places: on stage performing in a Cirque du Soleil show on the Las Vegas Strip, or in Rebecca Perrick’s Anti-Gravity Yoga class.

At Shine Alternative Fitness, the path to wellness, healing and strength means more than the traditional treadmill and elliptical. 

If, like me, you have been practicing yoga for some time, Perrick is unlike any other yoga instructor you may have come across. As a board certified occupational therapist, Perrick translates her in-depth understanding of the body, body mechanics, and sensation into her yoga practice. “Therapist turned Yogi” is how Perrick describes herself.

Knowing very little about me before our class, including the fact that I have a few years of yoga and Pilates experience under my belt, Perrick treated me as a beginner. 

When Perrick and I entered the studio, I found myself questioning whether or not this thin, silk hammock-like contraption could support my full body weight during inversions. Perrick recognized my initial uncertainty when we got into our first “zero gravity” pose, but with her ability to analyze body movements, I was flying with confidence by the second exercise.

 “I think beginners tend to feel safe in my class because of the way I can break down information,” Perrick later explained after class.

The neon green silk hammocks hang a few feet above the ground, customized for each student’s height. The silk contraption truly moves with your body whether you are in an inversion or utilizing the silk to deepen a stretch. 

By eliminating outside factors, including the floor, Anti-Gravity Yoga lets your body move in a manner that is difficult to achieve while on a yoga mat. The “zero gravity” element of Perrick’s class allows for full decompression of the spine and limbs—a feature, I realized only after taking this class, that is missing in traditional yoga practices.

I experienced a very different, but rewarding type of mind/body connection with the zero gravity inversions. There was also a calming familiarity of childlike curiosity I came across while upside-down.

While Perrick is not the only anti-gravity instructor at Shine Alternative Fitness, her classes are one-of-a-kind. Honing in on her occupational therapist skills, she also successfully incorporates essential oils in her practice for deeper restoration.

There is no question that essential oils make a room smell great. But when put in the right hands, such as Perrick’s, they contain effective healing properties. If, while reading this, your stomach was turning at the idea of swinging around upside-down, do not let your motion sickness sway you from taking Anti-Gravity Yoga.

After a number of inversion sequences, I was hooked on the practice. And though I wanted to try more moves, my stomach was begging for me to stay right side up. That is, until Perrick freed herself from her hammock and dug around in her bag of essential oils. One drop of peppermint essential oil on my tongue had me back on the silks.

Anti-Gravity Yoga may be intimidating, especially for those completely new to the yoga practice or to inversions. But this new “trend,” however unconventional it may seem, is truly a holistic and natural approach to wellness and healing—similar to medicinal cannabis.    

Whether you are looking for a way to relieve chronic pain, reduce stress, or just want to feel like a Cirque du Soleil aerialist for an hour, Anti-Gravity Yoga with Perrick offers healing through deep stretches, refreshes blood circulation with zero gravity inversions, and provides a therapeutic component through the use of essential oils.

Rebecca Perrick teaches a variety of classes at Shine Alternative Fitness, located at 6415 Tenaya Way, that includes: Fundamentals, Aerial Yoga, Suspension Fitness, Restorative and, of course, Anti-Gravity Yoga. The full schedule and list of classes can be found at <a href="http://www.shinealternativefitness.com" target="_blank">shinealternativefitness.com</a>.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine sidling up to the cosmetics counter at Saks Fifth Avenue or Neiman Marcus and buying luxury skincare products that are made with cannabis. Dirk Lindley, CEO of Cannamour Skincare, is hoping you will be doing just that by the end of this year. 

	California-based Cannamour spent eight months developing and testing its whole plant cannabis-infused skincare line of topicals and plans to make them available in Hawaii, Nevada, Washington, Oregon and Colorado in 2016. 

	“We took the best of every ingredient that is clinically proven in the marketplace and then we brought the cannabis into it because of its incredible entourage effect,” relays Lindley of Cannamour’s ingredients. “CBD has been a wonderful element that has spearheaded the whole industry to where we are today, but what everybody knows who is in the industry today, is the little hidden truth, CBD by itself is bullshit. You need the whole plant. CBD by itself doesn’t have anywhere near the impact. It’s not just the CBD and THC, but all the cannabinoids.”

	Billed as a miracle oil by Cannamour, the company’s literature says its Face & Neck topical, “helps banish the look of wrinkles and fine lines, plumps and firms, and hydrates deeply.” 

	“We take botanical oils and other types of actives and formulate them together and they would have an incredible effect on their own but we add cannabidiol and, more or less, it takes incredible proprietary formations and puts them on steroids,” explains Matt Haskins, CEO of CannaSafe Analytics, a cannabis testing lab, of Cannamour.

	Cannamour products contain a 50/50 ratio of CBD and THC, but Lindley assures that you can’t get high. “It’s virtually impossible to get stoned or drugged or test positive for this topical because it’s not entering the bloodstream. We started testing to see how much THC it would take to register and it never got to that threshold, it never got to the point where it tested.”

	“We believe cannabis works in your body like a vitamin,” concludes Lindley. “Cannabis will be proven to be the number one antioxidant, we believe, when this is all over.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The current legal status of marijuana is enough to put marijuana users and businesses in a constant state of confusion. Complex and often contradictory laws can be difficult for patients and businesses to understand and stay on top of. One area of confusion that has been coming up with increasing frequency involves the sale of cannabidiol (or “CBD”) products. For the purposes of this article I differentiate between “marijuana” plants, which are grown to produce marijuana, and “industrial hemp plants” which are grown to produce hemp products.

Although there may be confusion, one thing is clear, while certain states allow for the use of marijuana for medical or recreational purposes, marijuana remains illegal pursuant to federal law. It does not matter if you have a recommendation from your doctor; if you use, possess, produce or distribute marijuana you are breaking federal law.
<h2>Hemp-Derived CBD vs. Marijuana-Derived CBD</h2>
Industrial hemp is produced from the same basic plant as marijuana. Consequently, the federal prohibition of marijuana also prohibits the cultivation of industrial hemp. Nevertheless, it is completely legal under federal law to import several products produced from industrial hemp that is grown outside of the United States, so long as the products are derived from the seeds and stalk of the hemp plant.

Some of those products are very well known such as rope, clothing, lotions, etc. People are often surprised to learn that it is perfectly legal to import many CBD products produced from industrial hemp grown outside the United States. Anybody can legally purchase those products, you do not have to be a marijuana patient under state law and you do not have to go to a dispensary to purchase those products so long as the THC levels are sufficiently low (federal regulations require that industrial hemp products be less than 0.3% THC by dry weight). These products are generally treated as dietary supplements and do not undergo the strict FDA screening required of mainstream medications.

Ironically, Nevada Medical Marijuana Establishments (MMEs) should be aware that while many CBD products may be federally legal to import and sell, it may actually be illegal under Nevada state law for the MME to sell those products. Quite simply, Nevada is a highly regulated market and Nevada’s strict regulations may actually be higher than the federal regulations in some areas, particularly with regard to product testing. Therefore, MMEs should exercise extreme caution before attempting to sell any CBD products to ensure compliance with Nevada’s strict state and local regulations.

So the $64,000 question is: are CBD products produced from marijuana plants treated differently than those produced from imported hemp products?

CBD products produced in the United States from marijuana plants (and theoretically industrial hemp plants) grown in the U.S. remain illegal under federal law in practically all circumstances. Nevertheless, in spite of federal prohibition the laws of certain states and jurisdictions allow for the medical or recreational use of marijuana, including the production and use of CBD products produced from U.S. cultivated marijuana plants.

In Nevada, marijuana patients may legally purchase these types of CBD products so long as they have a valid patient card and the products are produced and sold by Nevada licensed MMEs. Nevada MMEs wishing to sell CBD products should familiarize themselves with the relevant legal regulations. State produced CBD products will be treated as any other marijuana infused product and will be subject to all the same strict state regulations.

Marijuana laws are complex and ever-changing. Both MMEs and patients should consult with a Nevada licensed attorney who is familiar with Nevada’s complex regulations before attempting to buy, sell, or produce CBD products.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cannabidiol (or CBD) is THC’s less controversial little sister. Overlooked and cast off many years ago as a hippie’s disappointment because of its lack of psychoactive properties -- CBD has suddenly found itself in the spotlight.

And under the microscope, for that matter, as researchers, scientists and cosmetic innovators delve deeper into the cannabinoid that is considered to have a much wider scope of medical and, even health and beauty, applications than THC. Turns out it could very well be the next big wellness breakthrough.

CBD users are finding that used in a topical form, it works on everything from chronic hip pain, arthritis, and nerve damage to migraines, radiation burns and permanent scars.

“There has been a good deal of pre-clinical data – not to mention user data – to suggest that a massage with cannabis oil or lotion has a positive effect on chronic pain, inflammation, and even burns, lesions, and wounds,” notes Rebecca Turley, a skincare specialist who writes for estheticianedu.org.

Dahlia Mertens, who founded Colorado’s Mary Jane’s Medicinals, a natural and organic line of cannabis topicals, concurs, offering that, “I feel like topicals are such an ambassador for the cannabis plant because it’s not about getting high but it is so therapeutic. Anybody can use this stuff and it’s so natural and gentle.”
<h2>Canna-massage is a thing?</h2>
When Elevate first heard about cannabis lotions and topicals being used in conjunction with massage, our interest was certainly piqued. As it turns out, Colorado is the most progressive, or possibly lenient, of the cannabis-legal states to branch out into health and wellness, especially the massage category.

“In Colorado, the popularity of cannabis-infused products of all kinds – including lotions and massage oils – has even introduced a booming new niche to the wellness industry, with dedicated “canna-massage studios” popping up everywhere,” explains Turley. With this in mind, Elevate headed to Denver to try out LoDo Massage Studio’s Mile High Massage which is advertised as a great way to “experience marijuana’s healing properties.”

LoDo does not need a license to use a cannabis-infused product because as Alexi Atkins, LoDo’s operations manager, explains, “We don’t sell it or upcharge for so it’s there’s no revenue coming through the company that’s directly associated with it. It’s a gift we give. When they book a massage with us, they can use the lotion or not use the lotion.”

In turn, LoDo customers can select from three options, of both the cannabis and non-cannabis nature. The selection includes 100% Pure Unrefined Shea Butter, Santa Barbara "So Natural You Can Eat It" Crème or Apothecanna’s Pain Crème.

For purposes of our research, Elevate chose the Apothecanna option since it is infused with THC and CBD, as well as Arnica, Peppermint and Juniper, and is billed as a natural pain reliever and anti-inflammatory.
Which, of course, brings us directly to the controversy that inevitably follows CBD and THC wherever they turn up: Will a person experience psychoactive effects from topicals or more specifically massage treatments that use CBD/THC cremes?

Can there be healing without the high?
“Most massage therapists have no interest in having somebody high on their tables,” explains Karen Menehan, editor in chief of Massage magazine. “I think the reason it is such a controversial topic, and there’s been so much interest among the massage therapists, is because people don’t realize there is CBD from marijuana plants and CBD from hemp. So I think there’s a certain curiosity and thinking that anything with CBD is going to get people high and I think that’s why people are so interested in it.”

To clarify Menehan’s point, CBD comes in two main forms. Cannabidiol can come from medical marijuana plants or from industrially grown hemp plants.

Project CBD’s Martin A. Lee explains their differences, “The flower-tops and leaves of some industrial hemp strains may be a viable source of CBD, but hemp is by no means an optimal source of cannabidiol. Industrial hemp typically contains far less cannabidiol than CBD-rich cannabis.”
<h2>Does CBD get you high?</h2>
Mertens of Mary Jane’s Medicinals drills down the debate to layman’s terms. “The THC (in topicals) doesn’t enter your bloodstream so it doesn’t get into your brain but it does interact with your peripheral nervous system and CB2 receptors in your endocannabinoid system so it is interacting with your nervous system but it’s not getting into your blood and it’s not getting you high.”

Mertens’ explanation lines up with LoDo’s literature about Apothecanna’s Pain Crème and its use in the Mile High Massage, which says: the THC does not enter the bloodstream, there are no psychoactive effects -- just soothing, cooling sensations and immediate relief from pain.

LoDo Massage Studio’s Operations Manager Alexis Atkins explains, “The way that topicals generally work, at least in the way Apothecanna is making them, is they just don’t enter the bloodstream so there shouldn’t be any psychoactive effects.”

Elevate’s massage experience was consistent with Apothecanna’s claim. We didn’t experience any kind of high during or after our 60-minute massage, but we did enjoy an impressive 12 hours of straight sleep the night of our treatment.

Michael Jameson, co-founding partner of ReLeaf Las Vegas, a local dispensary that carries CBD-based products such as Apothecanna and Trew Balance, concurs but with a caveat. “You won’t get high but the cannabinoids are entering your skin and body tissues and bloodsteam and binding to the body. It’s definitely going to end up in the bloodstream via the body’s nerve endings.”

The concern about topicals getting into a person’s bloodstream also runs to massage therapists who are apprehensive about applying the lotions. “I don’t think massage therapists are going to want to have it on their hands for one thing because you absorb it through your hands. And they don’t want to get high while they are doing a massage,” explains Menehan of her readership at Massage magazine. “I could see CBD lotion with trace amounts of THC being used by massage therapists. The kind from marijuana, I just think it’s too up in the air right now in terms of the regulations in different states. I wouldn’t see that being used anytime in the near future on a widespread basis.”

Two of the massage therapists Elevate spoke to at LoDo said they prefer doing the Mile High Massage with canna products because their joints don’t ache and hurt as much after a full day of doing treatments unlike when they use traditional products. And, no, they do not get high from using Apothecanna’s Pain Crème.

“The therapists really love it because they are coating themselves in pain relief and anti-inflammatory medicine all day long,” Atkins confirms.

LoDo’s clients are finding relief too. “We get everything from athletes dealing with injuries because it helps a lot with inflammation to the elderly because it is a really great way for them to access the medicinal side of marijuana without smoking it or consuming it in any way because it can get right to the places that are aching on older bodies,” says Atkins.
<h2>Will Vegas spas offer canna-massage?</h2>
At this time, there are no spas on Las Vegas Boulevard offering canna-massage treatments. Elevate reached out to MGM Resorts International, Caesars Entertainment and the Cosmopolitan and none have any plans to offer CBD-based treatments in 2016.

But that’s not to say the door is completely closed to canna-massage in Las Vegas. “If anybody was going to use drugs in massage therapy, I think it’s going to be Vegas,” predicts Menehan.

Mertens concurs, “I think on the Vegas Strip it will happen more quickly because people come there to party and cannabis is associated with that. Also it seems like Nevada is setting up their regulatory structure so that it will be easy for people to be exposed to this…I am not totally familiar but I feel like Vegas will allow a real cannabis spa before anybody else will. I think it will happen in Vegas in the next two years.”

And Mertens will be there to capitalize on the city’s embrace of topicals. She is working on a licensing agreement with a Nevada dispensary to have her products here by the end of the year noting that, “Everybody should have a jar of cannabis salve in their medicine cabinet because it works for so many things.”

Jameson agrees, offering that he keeps a little jar of cannabis salve next to his workout area. And because Menehan doesn’t foresee cannabis-rich CBD products becoming a mainstream spa treatment anytime soon she suggests self-application, “If somebody wants to buy the kind of salve that contains THC in larger than trace amounts, they can just buy it at the dispensary if they are a medical marijuana patient and use it on themselves.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Sierra Wellness Connection, managed by husband-and-wife team Jeff and Eva Grossman, was the first medical marijuana dispensary to open in Reno. With Jeff as the Cultivation Manager and Eva in charge of the dispensary, Sierra Wellness grows, harvests and packages their own cannabis. 

The couple turned to cannabis after Eva underwent surgery to remove a tumor. Following three years of exhausting treatments, she found that medical cannabis improved her condition and she gained her quality of life back. 

So she understands better than anyone what the dispensary’s clients, who suffer from a variety of illnesses such as chronic pain, brain injuries, and PTSD, are going through. Many of the dispensary’s patients have reported successful stories of recovery after using medical cannabis. “It has been nothing short of miraculous to see the improvements taking place over the past three months since we have been open,” said Eva. 

Sierra Wellness, located at 1605 East Second Street, offers a wide variety of strains (their full menu is available at Leafly), as well as edibles, beverages, and wax, in addition to glassware, vaporizers and other accessories. Sierra Wellness can also help with applications, doctor referrals and provide free consultations.

<h2>Newly formed Nevada Marijuana Council to  develop legislative priorities </h2>
The inaugural meeting of the Nevada Marijuana Council (NMC) drew leaders from the state’s cannabis industry to start developing priorities to build on its 2015 legislative successes in Carson City.

“The council is designed to promote common sense regulation and balance the many interests of the medical marijuana industry,” said Senator Patricia Farley, who along with Senator Tick Segerblom, started NMC. 

NMC has created four committees – Patient Issues; Pesticides, Cultivation and Production; Banking; and Ownership Issues – that are charged with exploring opportunities to build out Nevada’s regulatory framework. Committee findings will inform a list of suggested legislative changes in time for the bill draft process prior to the 2017 Legislature.

Along with Sens. Farley and Segerblom, Assembly members David Gardner and Olivia Diaz serve on the council. Other executive officers include President Riana Durrett, Esq., Policy/Legal Analyst Amanda Connor, Esq., and board members Lucy Stewart and Nycole Cummings.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[JB was diagnosed with breast cancer in 20ı0 and followed the traditional medical route. Well, almost. She had a lumpectomy but elected to skip radiation and chemotherapy and instead decided to live an organic life.

“After the lumpectomy I decided I am going to do this on my own. I am going to do everything organic and cleanse my body,” the 46-year-old legal assistant recalls, explaining that she prefers alternative medicine over traditional. “The doctors make me uncomfortable, I don’t like to take medicine, I don’t even like aspirin.”

But living organically didn’t keep the disease at bay and JB was diagnosed last April with Stage 4 breast cancer. “When it came back I knew about it two years before I was actually diagnosed. I ignored it, I knew I had a lump in my right breast. It started changing and so I knew I needed to do something,” relays JB. “They told me I had six months to live but I think they tell everybody that because they want you to do some kind of treatment right away.”

JB contacted a trusted girlfriend in San Francisco who advised her to join a Phoenix Tears forum on Facebook to find out more about cannabis oil. She started doing research and “decided that if I was going to do this harsh chemo treatment than I wanted to do cannabis with it.”

JB applied for her medical marijuana card, found consultant Lance Parvin of Compassionate Awareness Project to help her with dosing, and started taking cannabis oil in May 20ı5. A month later she started oral chemotherapy as recommended by her oncologist Dr. Fadi Braiteh of Comprehensive Cancer Centers of Nevada.

Between her use of cannabis oil and chemotherapy, JB has experienced dramatic results. She had two masses that shrunk dramatically between PET scans taken in April 20ı5 and August 20ı5. One tumor changed in size from 2.3 cm x ı.2 cm to ı.9 cm x .9 cm during the four-month period. Another mass was reduced from 2.8 cm x 2.7 cm to 2.0 cm x ı.4 cm. A third tumor that had measured ı4 mm x 8 mm in April had completely disappeared by August.

“I attribute her complete results to cannabis, I attribute nothing to chemo,” concludes Parvin. “There is not a chemo that is not heart toxic. There’s a University of Texas study proving that. They tested 29 different cancer drugs and found not one that is not toxic to the heart. I don’t attribute any long-term result to any chemo at all.”

Following a CT scan in early December, JB’s prognosis continued to be positive. “Dr. Braiteh was ecstatic. He actually gave me a high five on my CT scan results,” recalls JB. “I think I will be cancer-free within six months or less. I will stay on the oil. Lance told me as a preventative measure, I will probably have to take the oil for the rest of my life which I don’t have a problem with.”

JB’s faith in cannabis paid off, noting, “I never doubted the oil once.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s that time of year when we gather around our big-screen TVs, pick a team to root for, and cheer on America’s heroes of the gridiron as they go head to head on Super Bowl Sunday. One of our nation’s most vaunted and celebrated pastimes, we take our football very seriously. But with the recent spotlight on brain injuries resulting from the sport, it’s time we took the health of our heroes seriously, too. In clinical research surrounding the effects of therapeutic cannabinoids on brain disease, former NFL players could play a vital role as test subjects in the field. The newly formed Gridiron Cannabis Coalition is advocating for cannabis-based medicine and the positive difference it can make -- not just for pro athletes but for millions of Americans -- in the future of brain health. 

The game of football brings the brutal collisions of 300-pound armored men of muscle and bone into the homes and barrooms of America. The television eye also reveals the physical and neurological impacts of the game on its players. 

Some of the National Football League’s best former players and a growing number of researchers think it is time for the league to allow cannabis-based medicine for both retired players as well as for athletes playing now. 

One of the most effective voices for the changes is Kyle Turley, an NFL All-Pro selection in 2000, a veteran of the St. Louis Rams, Kansas City Chiefs and New Orleans Saints, and a college All-American at San Diego State University. 

At 6-foot 5-inches and 300 pounds during his playing career, Turley, at 40 years old, still looks like the powerful offensive tackle that he was.  

Today, instead of taking on similarly sized defensive lineman, he’s taking on head trauma and, to a significant degree, his former employers in the NFL. 

He has been active with several organizations, but about six months ago helped found the Gridiron Cannabis Coalition, an organization devoted to getting safe and legal cannabis-based products to active and former professional athletes, especially those NFL players who may have suffered brain trauma. 

“Basically we want to be a service provider for athletes in the (football) industry,” Turley explains. “We are organizing our guys. We can coordinate, unite and network together. There is strength in numbers.”

Former professional football players face a host of medical problems, not only brain trauma but also orthopedic dysfunction, chronic pain, heart disease and other diseases. 

“Anything and everything under the sun,” Turley says, describing the maladies suffered by former NFL stars. “The sport of football is not one that is associated with good health.”

Like his colleagues, Turley once consumed a chemical salad of pharmaceuticals, including pain and emotional management prescriptions, going back to his playing days. He was no drug addict – Turley has never, for example, been an alcohol drinker – but prescription drugs were the cost of the bodily punishment he experienced as a player. 

Researchers and physicians, as well as players like Turley, fear that sometimes these prescription medications can actually make long-term conditions worse for active and retired players. Pain medications have been implicated in cognitive problems. 

For active players, pain meds can help them play through injuries – but that carries its own significant price.

“In my own experience, prescription narcotics, in the 20-year span of my sports career, made these injuries worse,” Turley says. “They masked the pain so I could continue to participate but the damage continues.”

About a year ago Turley turned to cannabis-based medications to control his anxiety and pain – and he is now completely off traditional pharmaceuticals, he says. 

“Doctors are prescribing medications for all these injuries, orthopedic or neurological, that have very serious side effects,” Turley explains. “It’s been a real tragedy that athletes have not had a choice to use these (cannabis-based) medicines that provide real benefits without the side effects.”

One of Turley’s companions in the quest to make cannabis-based medical products available for NFL athletes – and, of course, all others – is former NFL linebacker Marvin Washington, who says that neurological damage due to concussions has been the cost of playing football. It is, he says, “an industrial disease.”

It is an issue that has moved into the spotlight due to lawsuits and as the subject of award-winning exposés in The New Yorker and “Frontline” on PBS. It is the subject of a-list Hollywood movie “Concussion” starring Will Smith that dramatizes intimidation directed at one of the first serious researchers to tie crippling brain damage of former players to on-the-field collisions. 

And always, there are the stories of once-celebrated athletes reduced to confused, angry and sometimes suicidal shells of their former selves, men like Hall of Famer Junior Seau, an all-star NFL linebacker with the San Diego Chargers who, at age 43, committed suicide at his home, or Mike Webster, who played as a center for ı6 years for the Pittsburgh Steelers and also made it to the Hall of Fame. After his retirement in ı990, Webster lived out of his pickup truck and suffered dementia, amnesia and other profound physical and cognitive problems. He died at age 50. 

Webster was the first former player diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) by Dr. Bennet Omalu, whose discoveries are chronicled in “Concussion.” Many other former players have since been diagnosed with CTE. In September, Boston University and the Department of Veterans Affairs released a study that found 96 percent of former NFL players they examined suffered from CTE. Additionally, men who played football in high school or college also suffered brain trauma, the researcher found. 

The NFL initially was criticized for responding slowly and even with hostility to the medical problems of many of its veterans, but today recognizes that it has a serious problem. It has instituted a serious of rule changes designed to make it harder for players to deliver the kind of skull-jarring shocks that lead to chronic neurological damage. The League has also adopted a regimen that removes players from the game when a concussion is suspected – although somehow players who appear to have concussions or other injuries still remain in the game.

Turley believes that not only can medical cannabis help former NFL players – and other athletes, and veterans, as well as those affected by brain and body injuries – but it can help existing players as well. That’s a tough sell for the NFL, which has since the ı980s had a tough anti-marijuana policy.

Turley and the Gridiron Cannabis Coalition, though, have teamed up with a New York-based company called Kannalife Sciences that is in the process of developing federally regulated, cannabis-based drugs to treat chronic traumatic encephalopathy and the kidney disease that contributes to brain disease.

Dean Petkanas, Kannalife chief executive officer, says the use of therapeutic cannabinoids have great promise for treating both orthopedic and neurological problems, but companies like his have a tough road to getting drugs approved by the federal government and medical establishment. He emphasizes that his company’s products will be fully regulated pharmaceuticals, unlike products available in the legal medical cannabis markets now. 

One end goal is neural protection, he says. If all goes well, the company could have products reviewed and approved by 20ı8 or 2020. 

Turley’s group could play a vital role in providing the test subjects for clinical studies that Kannalife needs for its research. 

“We’re starting to talk about a clinical protocol,” Petkanas says. “We’re hoping that we can work together, because they (the Gridiron Cannabis Coalition) have some real credibility in the market… These guys are going to be able to produce screened enrollees at the right time.”

Turley hopes that the heroes of the gridiron will be heroes in the testing and approval of cannabis-based medicine that will make a positive difference for millions of Americans.

“The more we understand the things that cannabis can do, the more we realize that cannabis is the medicine that should be prescribed for neurological issues,” Turley says. “The military, athletes, the things that we have experienced, unfortunately, through our career choices, we can really change 
this narrative.”

His own experience, free of negative side effects for a year, is Turley’s proof that cannabis works. 

“It is night and day different,” Turley enthuses. “I am ı00 percent relieved of depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts. I have had no rage for a year now. I’m able to drive again in the daytime and at night, to go to the movies, which I hadn’t been able to do for seven years.

“I know the truth. I know what happened to me playing football. I understand there is a medicine that deals with these injuries better than any medicine I’ve ever been prescribed.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A future edition of Trivial Pursuit will ask: Who was the last World Extreme Cagefighting (WEC) Light Heavyweight champion? The answer: Steve “The Robot” Cantwell. But it should probably have an asterisk next to it that states he was also the first legal cultivator in Pahrump, Nevada.  

Since Trivial Pursuit hasn’t yet cemented Steve Cantwell into the annals of pop culture, Google will have to do. When you search his name, there are a lot of threads on websites referring to his fighting career. Some of the comments go back and forth about his potential to be a UFC champion once he moved to middleweight, while other posts discuss how he was too cocky after bragging about breaking a fighter’s arm during “UFC: Fight for the Troops.” Regardless of what side of the debate you are on, his story inspires.

In 2004 Cantwell started training in mixed martial arts after withdrawing from school, quickly going pro in 2005 at the age of ı8. “I was just a troubled kid in school, I kept getting kicked out for fighting, getting suspended and things like that,” explained Cantwell, who moved to Pahrump from California when he was ı0 years old. 

He racked up some big wins before the WEC signed him. His first bout in the WEC was against All-American Brian Stann in 2007 which became the first loss of his career. After a couple of wins he fought Stann again in 2008 and won the WEC Light Heavyweight championship. When UFC bought the WEC, Cantwell’s record was an impressive 6-ı. In his UFC debut, Cantwell showed his dominance by submitting his opponent 4 minutes into the first round.   

Following Cantwell’s UFC debut he never won another fight but was also never knocked out. All of his fights in the UFC went the distance. But without a win, the UFC dropped him and he retired from MMA in 20ı2. “My body was breaking down. I got started at a really young age and the injuries kept stacking up. They say MMA fighters peak in their early 30s, and I turned pro as soon as I was ı8…so I figured if I was ever going to fight in my prime, I should probably retire so that way I would have the option of coming back when I reach my physical maturity,” said 29-year-old Cantwell.

FROM THE RING TO THE FIELD
The former WEC champion decided to go down a path different than most retired MMA fighters. He decided to try his hand at farming, but never one to follow the typical route, he decided to grow cannabis. Cantwell, who had grown up around a garden and always believed he had a green thumb, was familiar with cannabis because he preferred to medicate with it when he had injuries rather than pain pills prescribed by doctors. 

Although Cantwell preferred cannabis to aid in the healing process, he never failed a drug test while he fought professionally. “I didn’t want to fail a drug test,” explained Cantwell of stopping the use of cannabis when training for a fight. “When you are a professional athlete, you say you’re not going to use cannabis because it’s illegal. It wasn’t worth the risk of getting in trouble for it, no matter how much I enjoyed doing it, no matter how much I can benefit from it, it’s not worth it so I would always quit for that reason. Health issues are another reason I would stop smoking it, I would always like to give my lungs a break and just try to get my wind back for fighting.” 

Nye County had all the necessities for Cantwell to pursue his new endeavor. “Pahrump was really a small farming town... it was something I really enjoyed and fell hand-in-hand with cannabis. 
I remember the first time I saw cannabis growing as a plant, I just found it fascinating, like, ‘Oh my God, it’s just a plant like all of the other ones we grow but everybody likes it much more,’ it was just kind of cool.” 

In 20ı0, Cantwell applied for his Nevada medical marijuana card so he could start growing his own plants. He bought a bunch of books about growing cannabis, including some of DJ Short’s, who is considered America’s preeminent breeder, and started to grow. “I have really high standards and found it hard to find quality meds. And then when you did find them, they were ten times more expensive than everything else, so it was hard to find them and expensive to get ahold of them. So I got my card and learned how to grow, I got ı00 percent legal. I started cultivating cannabis the best I could and kept pursuing better styles,” revealed Cantwell. 

WHEN A PLAN COMES TOGETHER
Growing cannabis came very naturally to Cantwell and it was something he developed a passion for so he decided, with the passing of legislation in 20ı3 that allowed for the issuance of cultivation, dispensary, production, and laboratory licenses, to pursue something on a larger scale. Cantwell believed obtaining a production license was worth a try so he and his wife, Kouanin Villa, started looking for partners and investors in the Las Vegas area. Cantwell didn’t find that any of the potential partnerships available in Clark County or the city of Las Vegas were the right fit so he decided to return to his roots.

Having grown up in Pahrump, Cantwell decided to seek out a partnership in the tiny town because he had success there when he was looking for sponsors to launch his MMA career. As luck would have it, he ran into Mike Floyd, who was, in fact, his first MMA sponsor. 

“The lumber yard where we started Green Life Productions is owned by my first sponsor who helped me move from Pahrump to Las Vegas to pursue my MMA career and it’s where I received my first check from him so it’s kind of cool to go full circle back home,” explained Cantwell. 

Fortune continued to smile on Cantwell. Floyd had already been putting together a group and so Cantwell and his wife joined forces with him and his partners to pursue their vision which became Green Life Productions. 

All the pieces quickly fell together in a most serendipitous way. Floyd owned a former Ace Hardware facility with a six-foot fence around it which was a perfect spot for a cultivation facility. And Floyd also had a construction company which did the build-out allowing them to keep costs down. Villa focused on getting their cultivation license from the state. 

While other potential medicinal marijuana establishments were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on hiring specialists and lawyers to complete the application process, which consisted of several six-inch binders, Villa, who has a background in banking, decided to do it herself. 

“I started calling the state and figured out they were there to help. I would call the state five times, sometimes six times a day. I felt very overwhelmed but with Steve’s passion and with everyone saying you could do it that pretty much pushed me to get everything done,” said Villa, who guided Green Life Productions to a ranking of 48th out of more than 500 applications submitted to the state.  

DOING THE RIGHT THING (EVEN WHEN NOBODY IS WATCHING)
One of the mottos Cantwell has lived by, in both life and throughout his MMA career, was the dedication to do what is right even when no one is looking. He chose to apply that same philosophy to his growing methods.

“It’s what we put into our plants, it’s really easy, when no one is looking, to pour a fertilizer that makes them more purple and ten times bigger. It is really easy to spray a pesticide, herbicide or an insecticide on there that guarantees me no issues,” Cantwell explained of his decision not to use pesticides during his growing process. “At the same time it’s going to cause problems for the medical marijuana patients. So when no one is looking we still continue to do what’s right.”  

Currently Green Life is cultivating and supplying several dispensaries with their products including Inyo Fine Cannabis, Oasis Medical, Las Vegas Releaf, and Sahara Wellness. “We opened up with about 24 different strains but some of them are not around today, a lot of them didn’t make the cut for production…after seeing the demand and keeping our finger on the pulse of what patients wanted and what they need, we have limited our original 24 to about ı2 strains now.”  

The growing style Cantwell uses to nurture Green Life’s product is unique. “The way we grow is different from 99 out of ı00 facilities -- not just here in Nevada but throughout the industry in general. The cornerstone of our cultivation facility is our no-till living organic soil that utilizes the soil food web. What this means is we don’t feed our plants, we actually grow soil organically…rather than feeding the plant, we feed our soil and our soil, in turn, feeds the plant.”

Speaking with Cantwell you can tell there is something else unique about the way he grows. “We put a lot of hands-on love on our plants, we interact with the plants, everything is done by hand, and we don’t push buttons and walk away. Everything we do, we do intentionally to love on our plants.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A lot of Nevadans have been looking forward to the creation of job opportunities provided by the newly-opened commercial cannabis industry. Many people interested in these opportunities have been patients, activists and advocates in the industry for many years. Unfortunately, some of the most dedicated supporters of cannabis reform have a criminal history that may preclude them from working in the very industry they advocated to create.

Nevada law is crystal clear, all persons working in the Nevada cannabis industry, whether an owner, officer, board member, employee or volunteer, must undergo a thorough criminal background check prior to beginning employment at a medical marijuana establishment (MME). NRS 453A.322 prohibits persons who have been convicted of an “excluded felony offense” from working in a medical marijuana establishment.

NRS 453A.ı04 defines an excluded felony offense as a “crime of violence” or a violation of state or federal law pertaining to controlled substances, if the law was punishable as a felony in the jurisdiction where the person was convicted. NRS 453A.053 defines a crime of violence as any felony involving: ı) the use or threatened use of force or violence against the person or property of another; or 2) for which there is a substantial risk that force or violence may be used against the person or property or another in the commission of the felony.

Excluded felony offense does not include offenses for which the sentence, including all periods of incarceration or supervised release, was completed more than ten years before; or an offense involving conduct that would be immune from prosecution or penalty pursuant to NRS 453A.320 to NRS 453A.370 except that the conduct occurred before April ı, 20ı4 or was prosecuted by an authority other than the State of Nevada.

Based on the foregoing, any person who has been convicted of a felony crime of violence or a crime involving drugs (including cannabis) that could have been charged as a felony will be prohibited from working in the cannabis industry unless a few exceptions apply, including; ı) the sentence was completed more than ten years ago; or 2) the activities causing the conviction would have been permissible under Nevada’s current MME laws.

These exceptions can be fairly convoluted and subject to some interpretation. If you have any questions regarding your eligibility to work in the cannabis industry, you should consult with a qualified Nevada attorney.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>PUMP UP YOUR FITNESS ROUTINE WITH CBD</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Calling all bodybuilders, trainers and fitness junkies, this story should pique your interest and peak your muscles at the same time. Imagine the results you could achieve if recovery time was cut in half, your cardio output was increased, and you could fast forward the time it normally takes to find the right workout patterns and routines.

Sounds too good to be true, doesn’t it? But by venturing down this unconventional route, fitness junkies can accomplish more in just 
one workout.

In fact, Lance Parvin swears by it. Citing his background in herbal psychopharmacology, Parvin, co-founder of the Compassionate Awareness Project (CAP), one of the first co-ops in Nevada, even recommends medicinal cannabis for training purposes, coupled with other sources of nutrients, over certain big-name amino acids and supplements. 

As the medical cannabis industry expands and the public’s knowledge grows, the common misconception that cannabis only aids in anti-pain and anti-carcinogen purposes has surfaced. 

But according to Parvin, whether someone medicates to target a specific medical issue or utilizes it as a tool for training, medicinal cannabis has a broad spectrum of benefits. Since starting CAP, Parvin has converted many bodybuilders, trainers, and even performers on the Las Vegas Strip, who perform several times a week, into adding cannabidiol (CBD) to their workout regimens.

“That’s the great thing about [it], it can even get someone who is healing from a disease or injury back into being active at a faster and safer rate, rather than taking toxic supplements or prescriptions,” says Parvin of medicinal cannabis. 
	
In spring 20ı5, by chance, a local Las Vegas gym owner crossed paths with Parvin when he toured her gym. By the end of the tour, Parvin convinced Kelli Michaels (she prefers her real name not be used), for conditions unrelated to her workout routine and lifestyle, to give medicinal cannabis a chance.

After only one month of religiously taking CBD oil pills at night, Michaels noticed something very different about her workouts. “The quality of my workouts changed dramatically. I found myself recovering faster,” says Michaels. 
Ever since she can remember, gaining weight has always been a trial for Michaels. But by making CBD oil an integral part of her workout routine, Michaels is now able to move up in weight at a quicker pace when she lifts.

But the best part about incorporating cannabis into a workout regimen? It’s easy. For the most effective results, Parvin advises people to take CBD in the evening or a few hours post-workout. “Getting into a deeper state of REM (rapid eye movement) sleep is the key thing,” explains Parvin. “That’s when your body is recovering.”

As for Michaels, though taking CBD oil pills once a day before bed was just a small change in her daily schedule, the results have been positive. “I don’t have to worry about taking my pills with food or worry about if I took it at the right time,” she says.

For medicinal cannabis to be effective, THC must be used. People often assume that hemp oil is just as successful, but according to Parvin, cannabis becomes ineffective once altered. “So THC is necessary to see a difference in workouts and recovery time,” he explains.
	
Fitness junkies sparked by curiosity and inspiration after reading this story can get the green light for a medical marijuana card by citing chronic pain. “Pain becomes inflammation, which happens after a workout,” clarifies Parvin, a devoted fitness fanatic who integrates medicinal cannabis into his own regimen.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cannabis users have developed quite an appetite for edibles. The estimated market for cannabis-infused products (CIP) was between $650 and $850 million in 2014, with the biggest portion of that tied to edibles specifically, according to data from the Marijuana Business Factbook. Many dispensaries report that edibles account for at least a quarter of their overall sales, though that percentage can be much higher, reported Marijuana Business Magazine in January 2015, adding that some recreational stores in Colorado, for instance, say edibles make up nearly 60 percent of their total revenues. 

Because Nevada is one of the few states to recognize patient cards from the other 23 states that legally recognize medical cannabis, edibles will be especially big business here, too. So why are patients so hungry for cannabis infused products (CIP)?

One reason has to do with consumption. CIP offer an alternative to smoking, which is the most common method of cannabis administration. Even though a recent comprehensive review on effects of marijuana smoking on lungs showed that cannabis smoking is not a major risk factor for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and airway cancer1, there are still significant negative connotations with smoking. Cannabis smoke is not by any means equivalent to tobacco smoke in terms of respiratory risk, however, cannabis smoke does contain a number of carcinogens, toxic gases, and particulates. Thus, if there is a better method of delivery such as vaporization or infused product, and less of the negative inferences, the better. It is also an alternative for patients who choose not to smoke.  

Another reason for CIPs popularity with patients is that the effects are usually much longer than with its smoking counterpart; however, the onset is slower. With orally ingested cannabis, THC is metabolized in the liver to 11-hydroxy-THC, which is more potent and lasts much longer. These long-lasting effects are popular with patients who suffer from chronic conditions, such as persistent muscle spasms, seizures, and chronic pain. These products can also be consumed in places where smoking is not allowed, thus making them more appealing to a large number of patients.   

Medicine for Every Taste
There are multiple forms that CIP is available to patients. The most common method is the route of administration and absorption by the body. Gastrointestinal absorption, eating CIP, is the most common form of administration. Since CIP has to be broken down in the stomach and absorbed, this can take some time. Thus, the effects of the medicine may not be felt for 45-120 minutes after ingestion and can last for several hours.  

Oral absorption under the tongue (sublingual) or inside of the cheek (buccal) through saliva is another route of administration. This is usually achieved via a spray, lozenges, lollipops, gum, or tinctures (concentrated extract in liquid form). Oral absorption is much faster than gastrointestinal absorption because of the extensive capillary system in the oral cavity, which allows the medicine to enter the venous circulation thus bypassing the degradation in the liver with gastrointestinal absorption (first-pass metabolism). Given their more rapid onset, oral administered medicines also have a shorter duration of action. 

Finally, there are the edibles that have a mixture of both oral and gastrointestinal absorption (hybrid). The patients sense a quicker onset with hybrids because of the initial oral absorption, followed later by the gastrointestinal one. Elixirs (sweetened liquid), sodas, and energy shots fall under this category.  

Be Label Conscious 
A good rule of thumb for patients who have not consumed edibles previously is to start “small and slow.” Labeling is another essential part of edibles. Knowing exactly the concentration of the ingredients, especially THC, will affect how much should be consumed. Nevada has very strict guidelines regarding labeling and independent testing that require laboratories to confirm product composition. Patients should start with a small amount and wait. For gastrointestinal absorption products, this can vary from 45-120 minutes. It is always easier to wait and take more later versus taking too much and experiencing side effects. Excessive consumption of edibles can lead to intense hallucinations, anxiety, elevated heart rate, and breathing problems such as hyperventilation.

Packaging has become a controversial topic in many states because manufacturers have imitated popular sweets, candy, and chocolate wrappers. Many advocacy groups see this practice replete with potential problems through confusion and potential mishap. Again, in Nevada, state and local municipalities have strict rules on products and packaging. For example, the packaging must be childproof and not resemble widespread candies and sweets that are commonly marketed to children.   

A new culinary sector is being developed because of CIP. Chefs have entered this burgeoning entrepreneurial market experimenting with cannabis by using it as a flavor to create new dining experiences. Many cookbooks have been published on the topic as well. The health food industry is also getting in the game with companies manufacturing products with low calories, sugar-free, gluten-free, and vegan offerings.  

As the thirst for CIP continues, with the overall market share for edibles estimated to be between 25-50 percent, depending on the state, according to Marijuana Business Factbook 2015, Nevada is predicted to have a hearty edible industry.

<h2>MICHIGAN</h2>
<p>In a 6-1 vote, the Detroit City Council approved an ordinance regulating medical marijuana dispensaries in the city this past December. According to The Detroit News, the ordinance will not only limit the growth of dispensaries in Michigan’s largest city — estimated at about 150 — but roll back existing ones. The measure creates 1,000-foot buffer zones for dispensaries, which generally wouldn’t be allowed closer than that distance to drug-free zones, other dispensaries, city parks, schools and churches. The ordinance leaves 651 parcels in the city where dispensaries could legally be located, said Butch Hollowell, corporation counsel for the city. The ordinance will become effective March 1.  </p>

<h2>CALIFORNIA</h2> 
<p>Investors can now buy shares in the first publicly traded marijuana dispensary that handles cannabis from cultivation to storefront. According to Forbes, TerraTech, an agriculture company with a focus on cannabis has acquired Black Oak Gallery, known as Blüm Oakland, a retail medical cannabis dispensary located in Oakland, California. TerraTech paid 1.5 x the 12-month forward revenue, which is expected to be over $14 million, making the purchase price approximately $21 million, Forbes reported on January 12, with the deal expected to close by March 31, 2016. TerraTech is a penny stock and is currently traded in the Over-The-Counter market. The stock has tumbled over the past year from a high of 28 cents to a recent 13 cents. It has a market value of $31 million as of January 12, 2016, according to the OTC profile page.</p>

 <h2>DELAWARE</h2>
<p>Marijuana decriminalization legislation adopted in early 2015 officially took effect on December 18, 2015 in Delaware, making it the 19th state in the nation to remove the threat of jail for simple marijuana possession. HB 39 legislates that the possession or private use of one ounce or less of marijuana will no longer trigger criminal penalties or create a criminal record for adults 21 years of age and older. Instead, it will be a civil violation punishable by a $100 fine. Adults between the ages of 18 and 20 will face the same $100 civil fine for their first offense, then an unclassified misdemeanor for subsequent offenses.

<h2>NEW HAMPSHIRE</h2>
<p>The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services announced in late December that it will begin issuing the first round of medical marijuana ID cards to patients immediately, allowing patients to purchase medical cannabis in nearby Maine and legally possess it in New Hampshire, according to The Daily Chronic. Previously, the Department had said that they would not issue ID cards to patients until medical marijuana dispensaries were operational in the state, which could happen as early as spring 2016. But following a court ruling last month resulting in a terminal cancer patient bring issued the state’s first medical marijuana ID card,  the state’s attorney general urged the DHHS to begin issuing ID cards to qualifying patients as soon as possible.</p>

<h2>NEW YORK</h2> 
The state’s first medical marijuana dispensary opened in Manhattan on January 7. The dispensary, run by Columbia Care LLC, opened as part of the launch of the state’s medical marijuana program which resulted from legislation signed in July 2014 by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo. According to the state’s Department of Health, other dispensaries are set to open in White Plains, Syracuse, Williamsville, Albany, Kingston, Amherst and Liverpool. New York’s dispensaries can sell marijuana only in capsules, liquids or oils—not in smokable or edible form. About 150 doctors in New York have registered for the program, the health department said, and 51 people have been certified to be patients.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Oasis in the desert focuses on patient experience “A patient-focused, destination experience,” is how Ben Sillitoe, CEO/General Manager of Oasis Medical Cannabis, describes the newly opened dispensary located at 1800 Industrial Road.

&nbsp;

“We are centrally located and that makes us close to many neighborhoods so most people are driving from somewhere to get here,” Sillitoe explains of his use of the word destination. “It also ties to the people visiting Las Vegas because we are a destination. We are somewhere you might find worth while driving 20 minutes to get to.”

&nbsp;

As for the dispensary’s patient focus, Sillitoe wants Oasis to be an example of how dispensaries should operate. “We want to help elevate the industry to a higher standard and spread knowledge about the emerging scientific understanding of cannabis.”

&nbsp;

One step toward that higher standard is the dispensary’s employment of patient consultants rather than budtenders. “We don’t believe the term budtender is positive to promoting the image our industry so desperately needs,” explains Sillitoe.

&nbsp;

Another patient initiative is the display of test results and terpenes next to every strain. “We try to approach each patient from the standpoint of what they are looking for. We don’t advise on THC content, but, instead, on the desired effects of the conditions they are trying to treat so we try to match strains to those conditions.

&nbsp;

“For instance, we found that people who have arthritic pain have really been responsive to a CBD line we carry,” says Sillitoe, noting that Oasis carries everything from CBD tinctures, patches, pills, topicals and sprays to concentrates, vape pens, pre-rolls and flower.

&nbsp;

“Our goal is to make sure each patient feels like they have an individual experience that makes them feel truly cared for,” explains Silliotoe. “We customize the experience so it suits them. We feel out each patient and give them the experience that they want.”

		<title>Highland Medical introduces first high-CBD strain to Nevada patients</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Highland Medical will be the first grower in Nevada to bring a 1:1 CBD/THC strain to the medical cannabis marketplace. Starting this month, Highland Medical’s Highland Heterotic, which has an approximate ratio of 6%:6% CBD to THC, will be available in Las Vegas dispensaries.

This is a major development for patients in Southern Nevada because most of the cannabis strains carried by local dispensaries are THC dominant. Studies have shown CBD, which is a cannabinoid compound that has significant medical benefits, shows great promise, with medical advancements that include antitumor effects such as induced programmed cell death in breast cancer cells and exerting a chemo-preventive effect on colon cancer in a mouse model. But more commonly, patients use it for pain relief, appetite stimulation, and for improved quality of sleep, relaxation and seizures. 

“The medical marijuana testing services of G3 Labs has validated the data of Highland Heterotic which indicates a very promising potency profile with lower THCa and higher CBD levels,” explained Dr. Chaohsiung Tung, Laboratory Scientific Director for G3 Labs. “Very few strains with such a potency profile exist in the current Nevada cannabis industry.” 

Highland Medical was able to achieve a high-CBD level in its signature strain by using a hybridization process called heterosis, which is the tendency of a crossbred plant to show qualities superior to both parents.

“We developed the strain ourselves. It took a lot of work and the use of the heterotic effect,” said Rick Turner, master grower for Highland Medical, who started developing the strain in 2010. “It’s not just the genetics, it’s also correctly hybridizing the plant by using the heterotic effect of the plants combined.”

In addition to Turner’s use of heterosis to develop medical strains, he and his partner Rich Ginocchi, CEO/President of Highland Medical, are also taking the lead in the industry with regard to cultivating a medical grade growing environment.  

“We have partnered with G3 Labs to test our soil, plants and our environment every few weeks not by state requirements, but by our own requirements just for quality sake. We are not your typical commercial grow. The size of our operation and the limited number of high-CBD strains that we developed allows us to focus on quality management, using only the best products available and cultivation methods that classify us as a boutique,” explained Ginocchi.

“Highland Medical is paying extra care to ensure the plants are growing in a nurturing environment. To ensure a sound and safe cultivation practice, the environmental services of G3 Labs has been continuously monitoring and testing various samples, such as air, water, planting media, fertilizers, and pest management material from the Highland Medical cultivation facility,” said Dr. Tung. 

Highland Medical’s niche is truly medical as evidenced by both their breeding process and grow environment. “We have developed this strain with these truly medical properties for the benefit of the medical marijuana patient,” concluded Turner.

<p>John Sullivan, CEO of Integrated Compliance Solutions, is essentially an ambassador to the traditional banking world. With over 25 years’ experience in banking that has included executive positions ranging from president/CEO to chairman of the board, he educates banks about how they can be in legal compliance with federal regulatory agencies in order to do business with the nascent medical marijuana industry. Of the industry, which he joined on a full-time basis a year ago, Sullivan says he is “driven by challenges and this has been a huge challenge.” Elevate asked him about what’s on the banking horizon for Nevada’s medical cannabis industry, Congress’s role, and how other states are banking medical cannabis businesses.</p>

What have been your biggest challenges in getting the medical marijuana industry banked?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>The biggest challenge I have had is getting a financial institution and its board of directors to thoroughly evaluate the risks and benefits of providing services to the marijuana industry. Most banks, when you mention it, the first thing they say is no, they don’t want to hear about it because marijuana is federally illegal. However, the U.S. Departments of Treasury (FinCEN) and Justice (DoJ)  have advised financial institutions that they would rather have the industry banked and monitored, and, in turn, have issued guidance to banks on how to properly implement banking services. It is worth noting that the federal bank regulatory agencies have formally adopted the guidance issued by FinCEN on providing banking services and therefore are unlikely to object to a bank offering services as long as the bank implements an acceptable compliance program and as along as the bank is in good condition otherwise. But that new federal guidance is an enforcement policy position as opposed to a change of law, which only Congress can implement. This is why banks are fearful. </p>

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>Yes. I’ve met bankers who understand the need for medical marijuana as well as the need to provide services to the industry out of public safety. These bankers have been open-minded and have evaluated the matters very closely and have even met with the bank regulatory agencies as a part of their decision to provide banking services to the industry. These bankers have worked closely with the bank regulatory agencies in these efforts. After all, the bank regulatory agencies are truly interested in seeing that a bank provide services to the industry but only in a fully compliant manner; they are invaluable in assisting banks in this and so many other areas. Candidly, the bank regulators are very smart people and they are just like the rest of us, as they do see the need for the medicines and the need for banking services. </p>

What is the status of the Marijuana Businesses Access to Banking Act of 2015 (H.R.2076) introduced last April?
</a></h4>
</div>
  <div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">
      <p>This proposed legislation is intended to provide a safe harbor for banks and is nearly identical to the Senate proposed legislation referred to as CARERS Act of 2015. The CARERS Act goes further in rescheduling marijuana so as to break the logjam on research, exclude very low CBD medicines from the definition of marijuana, authorize the Veterans Administration physicians to prescribe the medicines and enhance state controls within their borders. The CARERS Act also requires that banks strictly follow the FinCEN and DoJ guidance.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, these bills have remained bottled up in committees since they were proposed. Congress simply needs to act in the interests of their citizens, who overwhelmingly approve medical marijuana. The failure of Congress to act to provide protection to banks is in direct conflict with the ongoing initiatives of the U.S. Departments of Treasury and Justice, and 23 state governments who want the industry banked. I think all of these governmental entities want the industry banked in a proper and transparent way.</p>

<p>I think there will be some marginal improvement in the banks providing services, and these will typically be smaller community banks.

<p>It is in the hands of Congress and I personally don’t believe we will see any movement until after the 2016 election.

I don’t think Congress can continue to be unresponsive to the will of the people in so many states, including California, New York, Florida, to mention the largest states, all of whom have legalized medical cannabis.</p>

These two gentlemen understand the issues and the need for a delicate balance in developing a banking solution. Without their support, there will be no solution. </p>

<p>I didn’t actually start it. It was Joe Brezny who started it. He would probably say we started it together. But I am going to give credit where credit is due. It was his idea. He recognized the value of having an industry association help to establish a thoughtful, well-regulated industry because he has worked in that space before. I helped start it but it was really his idea. My initial role was to find a founding chairman because that was such an important role. I reached out to several key players and thought leaders in the industry and they all said, ‘I would be happy to be a part of the board and be one of the founding members but founding chairman? No, it’s too much of a lightening-rod role. I can’t take the optical risk or the social, political or business risk.’ After trying to find the founding chairman for three months, Joe turned me to me and, ‘Leslie, everybody else is chicken shit. Would you do it?’ And I have been very pleased to get that trade association up and running here in the state.</p>

What are other states with medical marijuana laws on the books doing about banking?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body"><p>We have several client banks in two states -- not Nevada -- that are implementing our Seed to Bank solution. The banks in those states reviewed the compliance solution with their regulatory agencies before implementation. We are also in discussions with banks in several other states at this time.</p>
<p>The lack of a banking solution is a crisis and it is affecting state governments. For example, I attended a forum with state officials and industry members in California earlier this week. A representative of the state told us that they received a cash payment of $400,000 in sales taxes at a small office location that had neither the security nor staff to handle so large a cash payment. The California officials also told us that based on their research, less than 30 percent of dispensaries are remitting sales taxes, resulting in a loss of tax collection of well over $100 million a year. Finally, they discussed the public safety concerns and gave examples of violence occurring at business locations.</p>
<p>As a result, California officials are desperately searching for a solution to banking in the state, including creating a state bank for the industry, along with methodologies to protect the patients and public and finally, to assure that taxes are properly paid and in an electronic form. </p>
<p>The state of Illinois does not want to accept cash for payment of taxes. Illinois’s solution was to hire a bank which would agree to collect tax payments in cash from the businesses and to then remit the taxes in an electronic format. This works for the state of Illinois, but it doesn’t help get the industry banked.</p>

<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">
<p>I think community banks will be accepting marijuana-related business in five years, following a path similar to banking casinos in Nevada in the 1950s. Back then, casinos had the same problems in getting bank accounts because gambling was illegal federally and in most states. Gaming companies had a stigma that took years to go away, but eventually, banks did accept them as customers. As an aside,  gambling remains illegal in a number of states and there are federal laws banning interstate gambling operations.  </p>

      <p>There are thousands of people in Nevada who deserve to be able to obtain medical marijuana, but have been unable to do so, as the industry was operating inefficiently and not reaching far enough. This is what I have been told by dozens of people, including physicians, parents and family members. For this reason, it was very good to finally see the dispensaries open. In addition, it was good because those owners have spent years and a huge amount of money and they deserve to move forward. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Per the Silver State’s usual modus operandi, Nevada has cut its own unique path with regard to the evolving medical cannabis space. From being the first state to require lab testing of medicine produced by the state’s cultivators to offering reciprocity to cardholders from other states, Nevada has thoughtfully considered and innovatively implemented what is best for patients and residents.

As Nevada’s dispensaries have opened over the last six months that same effort of careful consideration has trickled down to the design of the various spaces. Dispensary proprietors have taken their charge of serving patients seriously and in doing so have shifted the paradigm on what medical care looks and feels like. In other words, these spaces look nothing like your grandmother’s or even mother’s pharmacy or doctor’s office. Instead they look like places that are familiar and comfortable to us but not in a medical way.

As Elevate visited the various dispensaries in the Las Vegas Valley we found that the interiors and design of space were beautifully curated to look like everything from an Apple store, cigar lounge, and coffee shop to an art gallery, ultra lounge, and spa. This was a pleasant surprise since the handful of dispensaries we had been to in Colorado gave us the vibe of being in someone's basement.

With that in mind, we decided to dedicate this issue to taking you on a behind-the-scenes tour of local dispensaries so you can see how medical cannabis and the space it inhabits will change the way we experience healthcare in the Silver State.

Devoted to a higher purpose and the well-being of the medical marijuana community, the Apothecary’s mission is to create a positive cannabis culture in Nevada. The Apothecary Shoppe plans to emphasize guest experience and wellness by matching patients to flower, concentrate, syrups, and edibles best suited for a particular taste or need, to provide accessibility to licensed physicians, and to raise the standard by which cannabis dispensaries should be measured.

Because the Apothecary Shoppe is physician-owned, they plan to research cannabis. Currently, Dr. Spirtos is conducting a study to research the effects of a THC:CBD syrup he has developed specifically for patients undergoing chemotherapy. Now open for enrollment, the study will determine whether THC:CBD syrup will control nausea and vomiting in patients using chemotherapy. Should you be interested in participating, please call the Apothecary Shoppe.

<h4>How educated are their staff?</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-body">

“We offer our concierges physician-directed training with myself as well as the dispensary’s general manager and other physicians,” explained Dr. Spirtos, owner of the Apothecary Shoppe, who added, “that the concierges will be in training until we are comfortable with their progress. We literally walk our concierges through 1,100 papers and base their education off of the actual literature.”

In addition, Dr. Spirtos and his colleagues emphasize the importance of getting each patient’s medical history and finding out what medications they are taking in order to take cross-reactions into consideration. They also work with patients to make adjustments. “We give them a dose and see where it goes and work with them until we find something that works,” Dr. Spirtos relayed of the patient care offered at the dispensary.

<h4>What does the place look like?</h4>

<div class="panel-body">

Featuring cabinetry and woodwork crafted by locally skilled artisans, the Apothecary Shoppe offers an upscale and impeccably stylish environment that reminded us of a cigar lounge. But the proprietors had another inspiration. “We wanted it to reflect a turn-of-the-century pharmacy with both its warmth and local feel. The goal was to convey how people felt going into their local pharmacist,” explained Dr. Spirtos. “We didn’t want it to feel like an Apple store or smoke shop. Frankly, having grown up in the desert, when you go to a place with a lot of wood it is extra warm and that was the whole idea behind the dispensary’s design.”

The Source is undoubtedly the Apple Store of dispensaries in town. “We wanted to have a clean, modern and industrial feel. But more than that, we are built for efficiency,” Jolley explains. Similar to an Apple Store, the Source’s retail floor offers a hands-on experience catered to patients. Each strain is displayed in a clear box which can be picked up. To enhance the user experience, the clear display boxes are equipped with a magnifying glass for inspection. The removable lids also allow patients to smell and compare the different aromas of each flower. “We really wanted to stay away from the jewelry store vibe,” notes Jolley.

Dr. Troutt, the Source’s medical director, is the dispensary’s greatest resource for both the staff and patients, according to dispensary owner Andrew Jolley. Each employee, whether a patient advisor or security greeter, is required to complete monthly training courses with Dr. Troutt, who has dedicated a large portion of his professional career to cannabis. “There is a lot of cross-training done here. We have inventory specialists who are hired to package and control inventory, but can also act as patient advisors on the floor,” explains Jolley. Thanks to Dr. Troutt’s detailed employee training, the Source’s on-site staff is well-versed. Dr. Troutt even extends his training courses to patients each month with the schedule of educational programs available at www.thesourcenv.com.

<h4>What makes them unique?</h4>

<div class="panel-body">

Thrive’s mission is driven by its main obsession: providing and producing well-grown, high quality cannabis. Britten refuses to associate Thrive as a dispensary, but rather refers to it as a cannabis marketplace. In that spirit, Britten hopes to be Las Vegas’ one-stop shop, providing a selection of everyone’s favorite strains from cultivators and producers around the state. As the cannabis industry evolves, Thrive maintains its passionate dedication to learning and keeping up with the most recent scientific breakthroughs and cutting-edge technology. Devoted and enthusiastic about growing the highest quality plants and offering patients flawless strains, Britten intends for Thrive to be Nevada’s price leader, offering the most competitive prices instead of stripping affordability from patients.

<h4>What does the place look like?</h4>

<div class="panel-body">

Thrive’s cannabis marketplace sports hints of retail stores REI and lululemon. But Britten’s inspiration came from the idea of sustainability. Featuring dark wood floors and reclaimed oak throughout, patients are met with a comfortable, inviting and familiar coffee-shop-esque feeling of relaxed comfort.

Mitch Britten, owner of Thrive Nevada, comes from one of the largest cannabis brands in Colorado, LivWell, which had 13 retail locations and employed over 475 employees. As the former director of operations for the Colorado company, Britten will be the lead educator of Thrive Nevada’s staff.

Compassion, knowledge, comfort, and safety and security are at the core of ReLeaf’s mission. In addition, ReLeaf strives to provide a thoughtful approach to patient safety and education, as well as demystify and divorce society from the subculture formed around cannabis.

ReLeaf’s management and location make it a prime choice for patients. The dispensary’s combination of doctors, attorneys and businesspeople offer a balance of responsible management that’s difficult to replicate. “We’re really accessible, responsible, professional. And we put patients first,” said CEO Ed Bernstein. Las Vegas ReLeaf is centrally located near the Strip, surrounded by 12 bus stops in a 1,000-foot radius as well as being within walking distance of the Las Vegas Monorail.

<div class="panel-body">

ReLeaf’s well-versed budtenders are educated on the dispensary’s wide range of products through interactive educational features. Budtenders, along with patients, also have access to educational resources online at ReLeaf’s website and via their mobile application.

Although we felt the vivid color and lighting palette gave Las Vegas ReLeaf a club feel, every design choice in the dispensary, from the colors and lighting in the waiting area to the menu boards, reflect a desire to create a physical space as warm and as welcoming as the service patients receive at ReLeaf. “Ultimately, we believe that great dispensary design, coupled with unparalleled service and top-shelf medicine, is key to having a great dispensary experience and that Las Vegas ReLeaf provides patients with the total package,” boasted Marketing Coordinator Jacob Silverstein of the dispensary. The dispensary’s design inspiration is not limited to comfort, safety and security were also fundamental to Las Vegas ReLeaf, which has over 40 surveillance cameras with facial recognition technology.

The dispensary has two unique attributes. Not only is it serendipitously located at an address of 420, which the owners didn’t know the meaning of at the time of purchase, but it is an all-female-owned entity. “Since it’s all women doing it, hopefully we have the compassion to help a lot of people. I know that word is used a lot but that’s why our group got involved. We are committed to the patients and the community and their needs,” explains Brenda Gunsallus, general manager/co-owner.

Sahara Wellness brings in professionals, including growers, attorneys and nurses, to educate and make presentations to the staff. Additionally, Sahara Wellness has a private patient waiting room so patients can discuss their conditions freely which, the dispensary’s owners, believe is important for patients who have never used cannabis as a medicine before.

The dispensary has a healing services room called the Community Oasis where they host educational programs and different functions including yoga, meditation and nutrition classes. Oasis also plans to hold regular events in the 1,000-square-foot space such as the chance for patients to meet farmers to hear about their growing style or listen to attorneys discuss patients’ rights.

"We research the terpenes that are prevalent in the strains we carry. We have also been doing research on the lineage of the different indicas, sativas and hybrids, and what strains were bred to create them. The generalized effects have all been researched and we put them in a flashcard deck for every patient consultant to use when they are on the floor to reference. We also want patients to know what farm their medicine comes from and the methods they use to grow it. We want our patients to be informed," explains Ben Sillitoe, CEO/general manager of Oasis.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Sandra Mallut, owner/chef of Culinary Butler Consulting Services, <a href="http://www.culinarybutlerconsulting.com" title="Visit Site">culinarybutlerconsulting.com</a><br>

<p>Guinness, an Irish Dry Stout originated by Arthur Guinness, is a staple of St. Patrick’s Day celebrations so why not consider adding it to recipes for some holiday flair? Its dark color and strong burnt taste add an extra special mystique. Many chefs make a Guinness cupcake using a chocolate cake base but I have adapted my recipe to a vanilla cupcake (to follow are both options.) The cannabis infusion would be adding your own butter or oil to this recipe.* </p>

[one_half]
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
1 (12 oz.) bottle of Guinness Stout Beer
1/2 cup whole milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil (Crisco)*
1-2 tablespoons of pure vanilla extract
3 large eggs at room temperature
¾ cup sour cream
¾ cup of unsweetened cocoa powder (for chocolate cupcake recipe)
2 cups white sugar
2-1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
1-1/2 teaspoons baking soda
*Cannabis infusion would be added to the oil in this recipe


[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>CUPCAKE DIRECTIONS: </h3>
Preheat oven to 350°F. In a large mixing bowl, combine Guinness, milk, vegetable oil and vanilla extract. Beat in eggs one at a time and then mix in sour cream. In another large bowl, mix dry ingredients (cocoa for chocolate), sugar, flour and baking soda. Use a whisk to evenly distribute all ingredients until there are no lumps. Next, slowly add dry ingredients in with wet ingredients.

Once incorporated, pour into prepared muffin tin (with cupcake wrappers or butter/spray pan for a non-stick surface) dividing the batter into cups, fill about ¾ of the way, evenly as possible for consistency. Bake for about 25 minutes, until risen and set (check with a toothpick for doneness). Once baked, remove from oven and let cool before adding any icing as it will melt off the cupcake.

[/one_half_last]

[one_half]
<h3>ICING Ingredients:</h3>
1 cup unsalted butter (room temp.)*
2-1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar (confectioner’s sugar)
1/4 cup whole milk
1/2 whole scraped vanilla bean  
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract or 1 tablespoon vanilla extract (you can find clear vanilla extract)
1 cup Guinness Stout Beer
*Cannabis infusion would be added to the butter.


[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>DIRECTIONS:</h3>
In a saucepan, simmer Guinness on low heat until reduced and thick (about 10-15 minutes). This will look like a syrup when done (be careful as the beer will foam and can boil over).
In a standalone mixer (Kitchen-Aid or handheld works great) cream your butter for about 1-2 minutes and then slowly add powdered sugar (go slow as this will make a mess) in thirds and alternate with a bit of milk each time to keep from creating an airborne mess. Mix until rich and creamy.

Add vanilla bean and vanilla extract (or just the extract) then slowly add the Guinness reduction (make sure it is cooled or it will melt your icing) a little at a time. Be sure to taste and determine the flavor strength that you like (you do not have to use the entire reduction).  

You can put the icing in a piping bag, use a sandwich bag by cutting off the end or even use the back of a spoon to apply icing. Once cupcakes are iced, you can drizzle the leftover Guinness reduction onto the icing for an extra kick of flavor. Enjoy! Happy St. Patrick’s Day!

*Please remember that when cooking with medicinal cannabis you are cooking with a drug and the amounts of the drug and portions of the food ingested should always be taken into consideration. Always start out with small portions or doses and wait 30 minutes to an hour before eating any additional portions of food prepared with medical marijuana.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Cultivation centers for medical cannabis are usually tucked into industrial neighborhoods where their anonymity is revealed only by the slight smell of vegetation. At the Evergreen Organix site about a mile west of the Las Vegas Strip, there is a slight, not unpleasant, odor. It is, though, subtly different.

Along with the smell of the vegetation maturing somewhere inside, there is something else. A sweet smell. Could it be…the aroma of something baking? A pastry, perhaps a cookie?

It is indeed evidence of something tasty and edible. We have arrived at the twinned cultivation and production facility of Evergreen Organix, which is distributing edible medical cannabis-based products throughout Nevada. Kurt Barrick, chief executive officer of the VonDank Group and chief cultivator for Evergreen, says the goal of Evergreen is to marry science and aesthetics, purity of ingredients and a philosophy that puts patients first. 

“We’ve tried to take an organic approach from the beginning,” he says of the effort, which this year saw the first flowering of its cultivation. 

Barrick, who says he’s not related to the Las Vegas family of Barricks, brings three decades of experience in cultivation to Evergreen’s operation. In addition, the VonDank group has pioneered clean-room cultivation in Colorado and Arizona before partnering with investors in Nevada’s embryonic medical marijuana industry.

Evergreen produces cookies, yes, but does not take a cookie-cutter approach to production of the edibles. To make it work for patients, Barrick explains, Evergreen has to have a range of products. 

“No matter what, we want to be flexible,” he says. “We have three different style chefs, a diabetic menu, we are health conscious, non-GMO (genetically modified organism-based ingredients), 100 percent organic ingredients. We have to be able to meet all the needs of different patients. It’s not just one product.

“It’s a lot of different processes, a lot of different styles for our customers.”

One element that is consistent throughout both the cultivation and production sides is an absolute emphasis on cleanliness. That’s not just a buzzword for Evergreen, but it is an essential element for a company that is trying to avoid the use of any kind of sprays or treatments – even organic – in the cultivation side, an issue that has reached media recently because of the detection of pesticides or fungicides from cannabis produced in Oregon and other states. 

The cultivation and production sides of the operation appear very clean indeed – 30,000 square feet of laboratory clean.

Barrick says that Evergreen has taken “an organic approach,” but he doesn’t call it “organic,” a term that only the U.S. Department of Agriculture can use to bless products. Since cannabis products, medicinal and otherwise, are still illegal under federal law, the term organic is for now, in terms of cannabis, undefined. That doesn’t stop Evergreen Organix from applying the methods that would bring such a certification, if it existed, or when it is available.

The focus is on keeping any and all kinds of contamination from the plants and, ultimately, the products. In practice, going into Evergreen’s Las Vegas center means wearing a full bodysuit, hairnet and shoe coverings to keep stray elements from outside from contaminating the cultivation and production sides of the operation. Workers who come into contact with the medicinal product have to take showers once arriving at work. 

Evergreen is using a carbon dioxide extraction method – training was ongoing through early February – which produces no byproducts and is, Barrick believes, perhaps the cleanest process to produce THC and CBD available.

“We’re trying to mitigate any kind of issue,” he says of unwanted chemical or byproducts. “It’s one step towards a cleaner medicine for the patients.”

Evergreen has only been in operation for a few months – licensed in November, the first flowering and harvesting of its cloned strains ongoing by early February. Jillian Nelson, Evergreen’s operations manager, says the company has a license for 1,960 plants, and had about 200 ready for harvest as of the end of January. 

A staff of 30 is keeping the cultivation and production process humming. 

She gives us a look at the 4,000-square-foot production kitchen, where brownies, four kinds of cookies and biscotti are on the menu. Topicals such as lip balm, hand cream and bath bombs will soon be available, along with several kinds of infused candies. And there will be cannabis butter for those who want to cook at home. The goal, Nelson says, is to reach “as many demographics as possible.”

Evergreen is now supplying edibles to nine dispensaries in Southern Nevada, two in the Reno area and two more are expected to join them soon, she says. 

So far, the reaction has been good, Nelson says, but all comments are considered as the company moves forward. “We’re very big on getting feedback from patients. We’re taking everything into consideration.”
 
One member of the team is Jamie Lockwood, a production supervisor. What that title means in practice is that Lockwood is a head chef, developing recipes, infusing cannabis into butter and then baking cookies, pastries and other edibles. It’s a job that marries chemistry and cooking skills. 

“I did my culinary training at the Cambridge School of Culinary Arts in Boston,” Lockwood says. “I then worked in American- and French-style bakeries learning to make all kinds of pastries. I really enjoy making the most delicious version of each dessert that I can.”

According to Nelson, the recipes start with small test batches, then larger efforts without medicinal cannabis products, with volunteers tasting the products. (Elevate tried one cannabis-free product, a peanut-butter cookie. It was, indeed, delicious.)

Lockwood says they appreciate and depend on feedback from end-users. Again, the focus throughout production is on having a safe, quality medicine that patients can count on for both taste and to be exactly what it promises in terms of content. 

“The ‘Classix’ line of products is my homemade recipes that have been multiplied into much larger batches using high-quality ingredients,” Lockwood says. “I’m very lucky to be working in such a beautiful and clean facility with top-of-the-line equipment and an amazing team. With every batch going out to a lab for testing, we know the exact THC and CBD content of everything we create. All these factors set us up for success in the kitchen and make sure that we are providing only the highest quality of products for patients.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Had it not been for a heart attack, Thomas Fillipino, 57, would not have found out he had renal cancer. “If I had not had that heart attack, I would be dead,” Fillipino relays in a matter-of-fact manner. “I had a 9-centimeter (cm) tumor on my kidney and it had spread to my lymph nodes, my liver, and my lungs. One of my doctors told me if I lived three months, it would be a surprise. He told me once I got out of the hospital, I should get my affairs in order.”

That was June 3, 2014 and Fillipino lives to tell the tale. During the last 18 months he has undergone a double arterial heart bypass, removal of his kidney, femur surgery as well as 14 sessions of radiation on his femur, 14 sessions of radiation on his shoulder, 10 sessions of radiation for lesions found on his brain, and a regimen of chemotherapy that started in December. 

In January, Fillipino decided to add cannabis oil to his cancer treatment regimen. “I’ve been smoking pot since I was 12 so I am not unaware of CBDs and what they do but I wanted to allow the conventional methods to work and see what they could do,” he explained of his choice to start with radiation and chemotherapy. 

Fillipino started taking cannabis oil gel caps on January 8. At the time Elevate interviewed him, Fillipino had already seen dramatic results following a CT scan that showed nodules in his lungs had substantially decreased in size and number. 1n fact, according to the January 26 medical imaging report, one node that measured 14x13 millimeters (mm) on October 22, 2015 was now essentially absent. Tumors in his lymph nodes had also shrunk. One tumor that measured 3.2 cm x 2.2 cm in October was now 1.8 cm x 1.2 cm.  

His results almost seem too good to be true. Fillipino would agree, adding, “which is why my doctor was so blown away, because it’s not normal. It blows my mind that I go to half the size of my lesions and some are even gone. I attribute all of that to CBDs. The massive amount of my change over the last month is due to CBDs. I wake up and I just want to do things and I didn’t have this kind of energy three weeks ago.

“The way I feel right now, I believe someday I will go back to work. In the year-and-a-half I have had this, I have never thought that before. I never thought of going back to work, and now I do,” relayed Fillipino, who is a union electrician. “And it’s because of CBDs, they have taken me from not thinking I would ever be myself again to believing I will be me again. 

“I have been a biker my whole life, and I haven’t been on my bike in seven months and that kills me to not be able to ride mybike. I got on it yesterday because I finally felt up to it. I just went down the street and back but I did it.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Revealing plans to build two dispensaries, a production facility and develop a cultivation the size of two football fields, the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe announced on February 29 that it will be joining Nevada’s burgeoning medical cannabis industry. The tribe’s announcement came during a groundbreaking for one of two medical cannabis dispensaries, which should be open by the end of the year.

“It’s like we have been holding onto a secret that we have had for a while and now we are able to tell the world and get this medicine out to the world,” enthused Vice Chairman Chris Spotted Eagle during the blessing prior to the groundbreaking ceremony.

Chairman of the Las Vegas Paiute Tribal Council Benny Tso acknowledged that “after much research, the tribe overwhelmingly accepted and wanted to go forward with this venture. With that, the Council drafted a robust and compliant formal ordinance that provides legal grounds to move forward and that complements existing state laws.”

Ultra Health, an Arizona-based company specializing in healthcare cannabis products with various entities in New Mexico and Arizona, will be partnering with the Paiutes in their cannabis-focused economic development project which includes a 84,000-square-foot cultivation using advanced clean greenhouse technologies that will reduce the demand for electricity, eliminate the use of pesticides, and conserve water through leading edge technologies.

The project will also consist of a 10,000-square-foot production facility and two full-service retail dispensaries with on-site exhibition capabilities. One dispensary will be located at the Las Vegas Paiute Indian Colony in Downtown Las Vegas and the second satellite location will be at the tribe’s Snow Mountain reservation in northwest Las Vegas.

Construction will begin immediately and both campuses are slated to be completed within six to nine months. The total project costs are estimated to be just over $5 million. The Snow Mountain facility will employ over 50 workers upon opening and will grow to over 100 employees during the first year alone, estimated Duke Rodriguez, president and CEO of Ultra Health.

“Today we are pleased to introduce you to the standard of what will become the most advanced state-of-the-art medical grade cannabis facility in Indian country and non-Indian country,” explained Rodriquez.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Offering that he “was just tinkering in the beginning but it qualifies,” America’s preeminent cannabis breeder DJ Short has been growing for 40 years. Short acknowledges that 80 percent of hybrids have his genes in them, adding that, “I have been releasing genetics since the late ’70s, early ’80s so it is not a surprise.” Short’s focus now includes, in addition to writing and speaking, breeding plants strictly for extraction, and leasing and selling strains as he has only released about 30 to 40 percent of his library. Elevate spoke to him about the federal ban, the future of smoking, and his epitaph.

How did you first become acquainted with cannabis?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">

It’s in my family. My great-grandmother was a gypsy herbalist. She got busted growing pot in Detroit in 1938. 1 grew up with that sort of knowledge always in the background. As a matter of fact, they used to joke, the grandparents and what not, that if the house catches fire, stay in there longer and take a few puffs before you go out because apparently the things like the curtains, tablecloths and linens were made from hemp. So for me, that aspect of it was always there. I didn’t realize it was a drug until I was 10 or 11 years old because of all the media attention pointing that fact out with everything (president) Nixon was doing.

<div class="panel-body">

I thought it would be one of them. I have been an activist pretty much all my life so anything toward peace efforts or sustainable resources, those types of things, I was always interested in. But early on, due to the oppression, it could only be a hope or a dream. It actually becoming a reality was an impossibility because we are just coming out of that fog now.

As more states start to move toward legalizing cannabis, most recently Ohio, what are your thoughts?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Ohio was a mixed blessing. I used to not care how the ballot measures were written and was much more interested in just getting it legalized, but now we can dicker and say ‘no, this doesn’t work.’ I am glad the media is focusing on it and that it wasn’t anti-pot, necessarily, that defeated it and it was anti-monopolization, which is a good sign. It just takes enough mavericks in this industry, who, if we keep the leashes long enough, will be able to set the standard so to speak. I am very much in favor of the smaller operations, mom and pops. I see no reason for this to go over one acre, one acre is 42,000 square feet and is capable of producing one million grams of resonated plant material a year. And with ratios of 20 percent – so basically a quarter million grams of extract off of an acre – that’s a good living. It’s not labor intensive especially if it’s being grown for extract, it’s something a small family operation can handle and I would like to see as many of those as is humanly possible.

</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

The big talking point I have been pushing for the last several years is very simply this: cannabis is the safest substance known to human beings, which is a hugely bold statement. How do you back that up? You don’t have to. You add another statement and that second statement is name something that is safer? You can’t do it. You can drink enough water to kill yourself. It’s the only thing we know of that is a nontoxic inebriate that does not allow us to put enough of it in our systems to harm ourselves.

<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

For me, it slowly is. I will indulge somewhat, I think, but I am more into tinctures and edibles myself. We are dealing with a human population that we have never had before -- seven to eight billion people -- so there’s room for all kinds of fads and interests.

</a></h4>
</div>

<div class="panel-body">

It’s the safest substance known to human beings, why are we regulating it at all? I think a seven-year-old kid should be able to grow it in their front yard and sell it like it was a damn lemonade stand. It’s not going to harm anybody and that’s where we have to grow up and get rid of the boogie man concept. The more of this plant we get out into the world, the better off everybody is going to be.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you know that your valid out-of-state medical marijuana card allows you to purchase cannabis from a Nevada state licensed dispensary? Through its reciprocity provision, Nevada law specifically allows for the recognition of out-of-state or “non-resident” patient cards. In fact, Nevada is the first state in the country to fully recognize patient cards from the other 23 states that have legalized medical cannabis. Nevada law allows dispensaries to recognize a patient card from another state (or country) under the following conditions:

&nbsp;
<ul>
	<li>The state issuing the card grants an exemption from criminal prosecution for the medical use of marijuana;</li>
	<li>The state issuing the card requires a doctor to recommend marijuana to treat the cardholder’s medical condition;</li>
	<li>The card has an expiration date that has not yet expired;</li>
	<li>The cardholder signs an affidavit on a form provided by the state of Nevada stating that the cardholder is entitled to engage in the medical use of marijuana in their state of residence and;</li>
	<li>The cardholder agrees to abide by the laws of the state of Nevada regarding marijuana use and possession limits.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;

If non-resident cardholders meet the above qualifications, they will be able to legally purchase cannabis from a state licensed dispensary. Certain jurisdictions within Nevada even allow patients to have their medicine delivered to them, but patients should be careful to choose a fully state-licensed and legal marijuana dispensary.

&nbsp;

While in Nevada, non-resident cardholders will enjoy the same level of protection from criminal prosecution by Nevada law enforcement as holders of Nevada issued patient cards do. Nevertheless, patients or businesses with questions regarding the laws pertaining to non-resident marijuana cards, or Nevada marijuana laws in general, should consult with a qualified Nevada licensed attorney.]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Inyo Fine Cannabis Dispensary to partner with Veterans Village</strong>

Inyo Fine Cannabis Dispensary, which opened last fall, has announced a community partnership with Veterans Village, a 24/7 crisis intervention facility in Las Vegas for veterans and their families. The partnership solidifies Inyo’s commitment to house a veteran for a full year. “It costs $20 per day to house a veteran and Inyo’s contribution goes directly to benefit veterans in need,” said Arnold Stalk, president of Veterans Village.

“We have partnered with Veterans Village for special events in the past and were privileged to see the great work they do with our treasured veterans. We are so pleased to make this commitment and we look forward to continuing to work with our community partner,” said Greta Carter, a partner at Inyo Fine Cannabis Dispensary.]]></content:encoded>

<h2>HAWAII</h2>
The Hawaii State Department of Health (DOH) received a total of 66 applications for medical marijuana dispensary licenses during the application period of Jan. 12-29. The medical marijuana dispensary law, Chapter 329D, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS), allows DOH to award a total of eight licenses initially: three licenses for the City and County of Honolulu, two dispensary licenses each for the County of Hawaii and the County of Maui, and one dispensary license for the County of Kauai. Each dispensary licensee will be allowed to operate up to two production centers and two retail-dispensing locations. DOH expects to select and announce licensees by April 15.

<h2>ILLINOIS</h2>
Despite a recommendation from the state’s Medical Cannabis Advisory Board, Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner decided not to add eight medical conditions to the Illinois’s medical cannabis pilot program. This is the second time the state’s health department has turned down expanding the list of qualifying conditions. The petition included four pain syndromes and post-traumatic stress disorder. The Medical Cannabis Advisory Board reviewed relevant studies and heard testimony from patients who could find relief if their conditions were added to the program. The state’s medical cannabis program currently recognizes only a narrow range of conditions, and Illinois is one of very few medical marijuana states that exclude patients with serious pain.

<h2>MARYLAND</h2>
In January, the Maryland House and Senate voted 86-55 and 29-17 to override Governor Larry Hogan’s veto of a bill intended to fix the state’s marijuana law. SB 517, introduced by State Senator Bobby Zirkin (D-Baltimore County), removes criminal penalties for possession of marijuana paraphernalia. The measure also imposes a new civil fine of up to $500 on public cannabis consumption. Gov. Hogan vetoed the bill in May 2015, after it was approved 32-13 in the Senate and 83-53 in the House of Delegates. Maryland adopted a law in 2014 that was intended to decriminalize simple marijuana possession, but it did not include marijuana paraphernalia.

<h2>MAINE</h2>
The group pushing for cannabis legalization in Maine has collected enough signatures to put the issue on the November 2016 ballot. The Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, which backs a bill that would allow adults 21 and older to possess cannabis, has collected 103,115 signatures in its quest to become the first East Coast state to legalize pot for adult use, which is nearly twice the 61,123 valid signatures to qualify for the November ballot. The proposed initiative would allow adults 21 years of age and older to possess up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana and grow a limited number of cannabis plants in their homes. It would also establish the framework for a tightly regulated system of licensed marijuana retail stores, cultivation facilities, product-manufacturing facilities, and testing facilities.

<h2>VERMONT</h2>
This past January, the Vermont Senate Committee on Judiciary approved S.B. 241 (4-1) which would end marijuana prohibition in the state and regulate marijuana for adult use. The bill would make it legal for adults 21 years of age and older to possess up to one ounce of cannabis and establish a tightly controlled system of licensed marijuana cultivation sites, testing facilities, and retail stores. It would also create a commission to examine issues such as edible marijuana products and home cultivation. It would remain illegal to consume marijuana in public or drive under the influence of marijuana. If approved, the new law would not take effect until January 2018.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been exactly one year since the first cannabis plants were handed off from registered patients to licensed cultivators and the budding of Nevada’s cannabis industry officially began to sprout. <em>Elevate</em> decided to document the many ‘firsts’ -- from the first lab to test to the first dispensary to open its doors -- that took place in Nevada during the last year. We profile the intrepid and resourceful entrepreneurs and businesses who will go down in the state’s history books as the pioneers of an industry. The ones who were undeterred by many an obstacle and persisted ahead to legally sell cannabis to patients in the Silver State for the first time. Read on to find out how an industry was born.</p>

<h2 class="page-header">FIRST CULTIVATION IN CLARK COUNTY <br><small>Alternative Medicine Association</small></h2>

<p>It’s been a year. A year since Paul Churchill, general manager at Alternative Medicine Association (AMA), rounded up a bunch of immature plants that would become the first medicinal cannabis sold to patients in Southern Nevada.</p>

<p>Churchill admits it was kind of a crapshoot because Nevada law dictates that cultivators must use the plants of registered patients. “It was part of the state regulation that we acquire plants from patient growers – we got immature plants, mothers, we got any and everything as long as they were plants that were already here because nothing could be brought over state lines,” stated Churchill. “We had signed affidavits from patients, plant acquisition forms, it was all very heavily documented and it was definitely reviewed with a fine tooth comb by the state of Nevada.</p>

<p>“It was actually a pretty neat experience. I just started running strains here that I had never run before and we ended up with some good stuff,” explained Churchill who would have loved to have brought the genetics he had been growing in California during the last eight years. “It usually takes a few cycles to get a feel for a plant and get to know its flower cycle but we had great results on our first harvest.”</p>

<p>In August of 2015, the recipient of Churchill’s first harvest, which included strains of Strawberry Cough and Cheese, was Clark County dispensary Euphoria Wellness. And Churchill did it all himself, noting that he had no staff at his 10,000-square-foot all-hydroponic cultivation and “grew, processed, tested and sold the first dried, cured flower.”</p>

<p>Even though Churchill was a one-man band he did have the guidance of the state. “We worked very closely with the state of Nevada, they had a huge learning curve and we were sort of their guinea pig. We got to watch their written regulations go into motion and they spent a lot of time with us. We educated them on growing cannabis and they helped to educate us on the new regs, the new policies -- the program they were rolling out here.”d</p>

<p>Looking back to last April, Churchill believes it all happened as it was supposed to, stating, “It’s all about maintaining the right climate and creating the right environment to grow the best cannabis in the world.”</p>

<h2 class="page-header">FIRST DISPENSARY TO OPEN<small>SILVER STATE RELIEF</small> </h2>
<p>On July 31, 2015 the first legal dispensary opened in the state of Nevada. Of the 55 dispensary licenses granted in November 2014, Silver State Relief was the first to sell legal medicinal cannabis to patients.</p>
<p>Aron Swan, general manager of Silver State Relief, attributes good, solid planning and a government entity that was easy to work with as the primary reasons the Sparks-based dispensary opened their doors before any other. </p>
<p>“We went for permitting on pure risk which gave us a good eight weeks head start,” said Swan. “Right when we found out we got all the licenses, we broke ground. We started work on the building even before we knew we had the license. We started running cables and door locks, stuff we could do without a permit.”</p>
<p>Being located in Washoe County also made things smoother for the 4,000-square-foot dispensary. “Sparks was very easy to work with. There’s not a day that I don’t wake up and thank God we are in Sparks because they have been so easy to work with,” Swan relayed.</p>
<p>Silver State Relief’s opening was much anticipated. “When we first announced we were opening, we received over 600 employment applications over one weekend. Of those, we interviewed 50 applicants and hired five. We were fortunate that we could be selective and hire people who wanted to work for us for the right reasons,” said Swan.</p>
<p>Silver State Relief opened their doors using product from several harvest-ready plants that they purchased from patients until their own cultivation, Silver State Cultivation, produced its first harvest at the end of August. </p>
<p>The dispensary currently sees about 120 and 180 patients a day and offers a selection of 25 strains, concentrates, tinctures, CBD topicals and edibles. </p>

<h2 class="page-header">FIRST LAB TO TEST<small>374 LABS</small>  </h2>
<p>Nevada has the distinction of being the first state to require the lab testing of cannabis before it ends up in the hands of patients. And 374 Labs will go down in the history books as the lab that tested the first cannabis sold in the state -- which seems rather appropriate since it is named for the Senate bill that created the regulatory framework for the state’s budding medical cannabis industry, SB 374. </p>
<p>“When we finally decided to pull the trigger and go all in, it was kind of a tip of the hat to the legislative and state process that is now governing us,” explained 374 Labs Managing Partner Alec Garcia of how he and his partners chose the lab’s name.</p>
<p>Although Garcia doesn’t have a background in cannabis testing, one of his partners is a certified toxicologist. “We had a generic background in cannabis and then through the application process and research and reaching out to labs in other states, we really began to understand the complexities of working with this plant in this matrix. There’s not standardization across this industry in general so it’s kind of a ‘do and learn as you go’ type of thing.”</p>
<p>374 Labs, located in Sparks, received its state approval in May 2015 and by the end of July the first product was ready for analysis and so was the 2,500-square-foot lab. “It was exciting but at the same time it was a stressful and interesting time period because you don’t want your first go-round to be a disaster. We tried to cross all the Ts and dot all the Is.”</p>
<p>Garcia and his partners did this through a lot of practice. “During the first month we were open, we used Emerald Scientific Proficiency Testing for potency. We did that to make sure we were basically on the money and we got plus or minus two percent which is pretty good, especially right out of the gate for just starting to actually analyze. Another step we took when we first opened was to quantify that our results were what we said they were. </p>
<p>“We started validating when the list was still at 80 pesticides. We just bought all the standards and were working through that process and then the list changed again and some of the pesticides transferred over and others were new. But because we had a jumpstart based on what we thought the list was going to be, I think that allowed us to open up quicker than a lot of the other laboratories in both the north and the south.” </p>

<h2 class="page-header">FIRST NEVADA GROWER TO WIN A MEDICAL CANNABIS CUP <small>NEVADAPURE</small></h2>
<p>“It’s beginner’s luck,” modestly admitted Kathy Gillespie of NevadaPure’s Medical Cannabis Cup win in February. Gillespie and her team at NevadaPure won two awards during High Time’s 2016 SoCal Medical Cannabis Cup: first place for Best CBD Concentrate with its Goji D.C. and third place for Best Medical Non-Solvent Hash with Kookies. </p>
<p>Being a first-time grower, Gillespie, who is a co-owner of the dispensary, cultivation and production housed in a 70,000-square-foot facility on Boulder Highway, definitely thought a win wasn’t in the cards. </p>
<p>“We just thought the odds of us winning -- being a newbie let alone the first ones in Nevada to enter -- a first and a third would be unheard of, but we have some excellent growers and cultivators down here who have excellent eyes,” said Gillespie, who has a degree in horticulture. “I didn’t do it on my own. I have been working with our head grower on this for six months to pick a strain that we had here that we really liked that I had in my home that I had been growing and looking at and feeling really warm and fuzzy about.” </p>
<p>The cultivators at NevadaPure started with a very small pool of germ plasm that they believed had a lot of potential for improvement. “I was just looking at a lot of the attributes I thought we could improve on. Something that grew with a larger flower that would yield better nub because, keep in mind, that our intention was to turn it into a wax or oil to treat children with epilepsy or patients with cancer,” explained Gillespie. “We wanted a very high CBD content and we wanted a large percent. One of my goals in developing this strain and this germ plasm was to try and develop a higher yielding CBD strain that also yielded a higher CBD concentrate percentage and obviously I got real, real lucky the first time.”</p>
<p>NevadaPure plans to enter its award-winning Goji D.C. in Denver’s upcoming Cannabis Cup April 22-24. For those patients interested in the concentrate, it will be available at NevadaPure in the next several weeks. </p>
<p>(Editor’s Note: NevadaPure can also claim another first, its production house was also the first in Nevada to sell their edibles to patients.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For some people, the prospect of cultivating marijuana plants in Nevada’s growing cannabis industry might spark images of Humboldt County hippies in tie-dyes under the sunny sky. Of course, the high-tech reality of the Silver State’s marijuana industry has very little connection with the old, outdoor and haphazard ways of underground agriculture.</p>
<p>Indeed, the modern cultivation center uses enormous amounts of water and power, the two components without which the plants cannot survive. Those resources not only cost the producers many thousands of dollars every month, but strain the ability of utilities to supply them. Providing those resources comes at a price. Electricity is largely produced by burning fossil fuels, which pollutes the sky with heat-holding carbon, and water, as we are often reminded in Southern Nevada, is one of most precious natural resources, mostly arriving through the rapidly dwindling supply in Lake Mead.</p>
<p>But the new industry is wrestling with the environmental impacts of its marijuana cultivation and production, and the cost, environmental and financial, of water and electrical power.</p>
<p>Darrick J. Cole, co-founder and managing partners of Skytree Capital Partners, is somewhat of a skeptic when it comes to putting money into “green” environmental elements of cultivation centers. The reason, he explains, is money.</p>
<p>It can cost upwards of $5 million to go through the licensing process and build an approved cultivation facility. With those kinds of costs, investors rarely have money to put into environmental enhancements, Cole, whose company is an equity lender in the cannabis industry, says.</p>
<p>“There are a few deep pockets trying to do alternatives” to traditional lighting and watering systems, he acknowledges.</p>
<p>And he notes that there have been real advances in some technologies, particularly in lighting systems, that use less electricity and produce less heat, which saves on air-conditioning costs. A lot of the technology is so new that people aren’t sure that it will ultimately save significant amounts of power and money, Cole said.</p>
<p>“I think there’s going to be a lot of trial and error,” Cole says. “I think it’s going to come. I just don’t think it’s here yet.”</p>
<p>Producers in other parts of the country have advantages when it comes to environmental sensitivities. In California, for example, cannabis growers can do it outside, using the natural light of the sun and the natural cooling of the great outdoors, an option that is not available in Nevada, where grows by law have to be indoors and smell-contained.</p>
<p>Indoor cultivators in other parts of the country where medical or recreational marijuana is legal under state laws don’t have to contend with Southern Nevada’s brutal summer heat. And many of the cultivators in Nevada have only seen their first mature plant harvests in the last few months. It remains to be seen how they will handle the first full summer, in which outdoor temperatures can easily exceed 110 degrees.</p>
<p>But cultivators and entrepreneurs are clever people, and many of them are already finding cost-effective ways to bring down power and water costs and be kind to the environment.</p>
<p>Jon Harms, president and founder of Nano Evaporative Technologies Inc., believes he has found a technology that can cut the cooling costs of cultivation facilities in half. It is a hybrid technology that combines evaporation from terracotta-like ceramics with traditional air conditioning systems.</p>
<p>It is more than a swamp cooler and works well in humid situations, Harms says.</p>
<p>He says he would be happy to install his systems in any kind of building that needs cooling -- which in Southern Nevada, means any kind of building with people in it -- but cultivation centers were among the first to come calling, simply because their cooling needs are so expensive and extreme.</p>
<p>Harms says he has installed his cooling systems in about four large-scale hydroponics cultivation centers so far.</p>
<p>In his unassuming shop in the southwest Las Vegas Valley, Harms has a demonstration system set up. Air blows through the system, coming out about 20 degrees below the ambient air temperature. The demonstration system runs on regular AC current. Unlike a traditional air conditioner, there is no waste heat expelled. It’s not exactly a refutation of Isaac Newton, Harms explains. There is no heat generated and forced out of the system because the evaporative system uses the energy from the warm air in the cooling process.</p>
<p>It still looks and sounds a little like magic, but Harms says his system in scalable. Since the power needs are modest, a solar-powered system might be able to provide spot cooling needs in disaster situations.</p>
<p>In the meantime, cultivators can cut their cooling needs and air-conditioning bills by 25 to 50 percent, Harms says, noting, “This technology can pretty much change the industry.”</p>
<p>Another technology that is being deployed and changing the industry is advanced light-emitting-diode lighting. Kevin Biernacki is a master grower at a nondescript cultivation facility in Southern Nevada. He says the computer-controlled LED lighting he uses has some significant advantages over the traditional high-pressure sodium lights that have, heretofore, been the industry standard.</p>
<p>The powerful LEDs he uses can be tailored to provide whatever part of the visible spectrum is needed for the plants. The lighting system is computer controlled and can be accessed from a remote location.</p>
<p>The old high-pressure-sodium lights would need frequent replacement, sometimes after just one full grow cycle. And they produce heat, a lot of heat, over 600 degrees. All that heat had to be carried off by powerful air condition systems, which also consume tremendous amounts of energy.</p>
<p>The new LEDs should last five to 10 years, Biernacki says.</p>
<p>The best part? “There’s a significant saving in cost and overall carbon output,” he says. The new lighting technology has cut the air-conditioning needs for the grow site in half.</p>
<p>Biernacki and his colleague, Brandon Wiegand, a vice president at the Grove, which has two dispensaries in Southern Nevada, say that they are among the first cultivators to use the new LED lighting technology.</p>
<p>“We’re the largest grow where this has been deployed,” Wiegand says of the 16,660-square-foot cultivation. “That will only last so long, but we’ll shout it from the rooftops while we can.”</p>
<p>Beirnacki says the goal of his effort is two-fold: To save money, but also to be good stewards of the environment.</p>
<p>A few miles away, in an old food warehouse in the shadow of Strip high rises, an even bigger effort to save power and water is in place. Darin Carpenter, director of cultivation for Tryke Companies, oversees operations at a cultivation site that is 105,000 square feet, with capacity to expand another 50,000 square feet if and when the demand is there. The company also is building a dispensary and production center at the site, which is now producing 76 strains of marijuana and holds, Carpenter says, a “genetic locker” of 300 strains.</p>
<p>Much of the product in the grow rooms looks like similar grow rooms around Las Vegas, but Carpenter says the differences are substantial. The use of different technology has allowed them to reduce the water used in their hydroponics system by half, he says.</p>
<p>Computers monitor the nutrient mix and amount of water released to the plants, and instead of just water, the plants are nourished by a moist membrane underneath the trays. Systems catch the water “exhaled” by the plants in the natural process of transpiration, allowing the center to save even more water, he explains – up to 70 percent efficiency over other hydroponics systems.</p>
<p>The water is collected in enormous plastic containers the size of a two-door Fiat, 2,400 gallons when full, purified and sent back to provide sustenance to the plants.</p>
<p>There is a similar effort underway on the power-use side of Tryke’s operation. The complex uses 4.6 megawatts of electricity – a lot of power, certainly, but Carpenter says a similarly sized operation would use roughly 8 megawatts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an unconventional air-conditioning system depends on cooled water pumping through the former warehouse, a system that Carpenter calls “the lungs” of the operation. Evaporative cooling and a circulation throughout the complex keep the people, and, most importantly, the thousands of plants, comfortable.</p>
<p>The systems cut 40 to 50 percent off their power bills versus traditional air conditioning, Carpenter says.</p>
<p>Carpenter is tall and thin, and in his lab coat, he looks a lot like the scientist he was trained to be. We ask, why does he do it? Is he a tree-hugging hippie, or is he just trying to save on the bottom line?</p>
<p>“It’s both, actually,” he says with a shrug. “We want to feel good about what we are doing as an industry.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

    <p>It’s primetime for butterflies in the desert. And one of the best places to see them up close in all of their vivid finery is at the Springs Preserve’s Butterfly Habitat, which is home to North American and exotic butterflies. Butterfly lovers can wander among the 2,000-square-foot habitat’s springtime residents and not only study their spectacular markings, but also learn about the plants that sustain them. The seasonal habitat is open until May 30. </p>

    <p>Allergy sufferers who can’t enjoy Mother Nature the old-fashioned way this Earth Day can immerse themselves in a Halo-Yoga class or a Halo-Meditation session at the Salt Room. The classes are taught in a salt-infused chamber lined with peach-colored Himalayan salt bricks illuminated from behind. Known to help with respiratory ailments such as allergies, asthma, bronchitis and COPD, salt-laden air wafts in through vents and works as an anti-inflammatory to ease respiratory illnesses.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s hard to believe that Elevate Nevada has already been exploring the world of cannabis for a year. When the magazine launched last April nary a grow facility or dispensary was open. The thought of going to a dispensary and being able to buy medicine was just but a twinkle in the eye of many a suffering patient. Now we have a budding industry with more than 15 dispensaries throughout the state providing care and access to Nevada’s approximately 15,000 card-carrying patients as well as any of the medical tourists visiting our state who possess patient cards from their state. </p>

<p>The team at Elevate has spent the last year sharing not only the medical discoveries of cannabis, but also the stories of medicinal cannabis patients who have found comfort and healing using this miracle plant. From epilepsy and breast cancer to PTSD and concussions, our cover stories have run the gamut. But in the nine issues we have already published, we haven’t even begun to explore all the conditions and diseases cannabis can alleviate, heal and bring relief to. We look forward to the myriad topics we have still to cover and appreciate you discovering them along with us as we continue to elevate the conversation surrounding medical cannabis. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The team behind Nature-Cide All-Purpose Insecticide is so serious about having the best product in the cannabis industry they have also spent the last three years educating themselves not only in pest control, but as a patient group using the California exemption also started cultivating which allowed them to put the Nature-Cide products to the test.  </p>
<p>“Since we have been cultivating, we  have discovered not only how to cultivate well, but how to cultivate completely organically,” explained Matthew Mills, COO and President of Med-X, the developer of Nature-Cide. </p>
<p>Formulated to kill and repel a wide variety of insects, including ants, spider mites, cockroaches, fleas, ticks, bedbugs and other pests while remaining nontoxic to pets, plants and people, Nature-Cide could allow cultivators to grow organically and cleanly without ever having to spray the plants directly.</p>
<p>“We have discovered that by spraying our cultivation on the constant, in some cases daily -- not directly on our plants -- mopping the floors with the product, wiping down the walls, and spraying the perimeter of the building’s exterior, we have managed to discover in most cases, we don't need to spray anything on the plants at all,” enthused Mills. “We have pest-managed prior to it ever getting to the plant which allows us to grow super-organically. We have figured out a way to treat constantly by using Nature-Cide without spraying directly on the plant, keeping everything at bay.”</p>
<p>In development for the last five years, Nature-Cide has been third-party tested, nationally registered with the EPA in the 39 states that require it, and approved for use on cannabis by the Agriculture Department of Colorado. The 100-percent natural pesticide is also on the recommended lists in both Oregon and Washington for use on cannabis.</p>
<p>Having their own cultivation has also opened the Med-X team’s eyes to other issues growers face in the pest control arena. “We dove into hydroponics first and found it was not the way to go because of the many pests that are attracted to water,” explained Mills. “Using hydroponics back in the day was good but now with all the breakthroughs in soil, it doesn’t make sense. We developed a really good soil medium and started mixing in our pesticide product only to recognize that we immediately stopped having issues with insects on plants altogether.”</p>
<p>Med-X started developing its soil product in early 2015 and has been testing it over the last year. “We introduced some bugs into the cultivation to see what would really happen and it was a little scary at first, but it worked right away,” said Mills of Med-X’s Nature-Cide soil product, which could be available as soon as the third quarter 2016.</p>
<p>“We are cultivators now and through our many hours of R&amp;D we understand and take to heart what it means to patients for growers to be assured a healthier and greener harvest, every time,” concluded Mills. </p>

		<title>Evergreen Organix Makes Needs of Patients Top Priority</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For Evergreen Organix Cultivation and Production, it’s all about the patients. </p>
<p>“First and foremost, the strains must meet the demands and medicinal requirements of the patients,” explained Kurt Barrick, chief cultivator of Evergreen Organix, of how his cultivation team selects the strains they grow. </p>
<p>“We are looking to the patients of Nevada for their feedback, and data from testing to make selections for exclusive breeding. If the patients don't like a strain we’re growing, than that strain will be replaced with something that meets their needs,” continued Barrick, who is also CEO of the VonDank Group, noting that Evergreen uses the results of lab testing to define what strains meet the levels that dispensary owners, patients, and bud tenders are requesting. “We closely monitor what strains are working well for patients in multiple states. And having experience in other states also allows for a broader collection of data from strains.”</p>
<p>Barrick notes that currently there is a demand in the Nevada marketplace for strains with THC testing over 20 percent. “We understand this, but also are aware that different ratios of cannabinoids and terpene profiles affect the medicinal properties of strains,” Barrick said.</p>
<p>In addition to patient demand to determine which strains they will grow, Barrick and his team also look at THC percentages along with CBN, CBD, and all cannabinoids as well as multiple genetic traits such as size, shape, density, color, maturation time, smell, growth characteristics, production weight, medicinal effect, and length of effect. With that in mind, Evergreen Organix is currently cultivating approximately 30 strains that include several exclusive clone-only strains at its 30,000-square-foot Las Vegas facility. </p>
<p>“We are breeding popular genetics and with the experience in trait selection and lab testing, we will offer these only through Evergreen Organix,” Barrick explained. </p>
<p>“We also have some VonDank strains like Godzilla, which is about as close to pure Indica as you can get, that are stabilized and Evergreen will have first-use opportunity for sales on those strains as well.”</p>
<p>Another important aspect of Evergreen Organix’s growing process is their cultivation of both natural and hydroponic medicine. “We have a flowering room for cultivating in the methodology of veganic, soil less, permaculture style along with multiple rooms of lab-grade hydroponics,” Barrick said. “This really gives Evergreen the flexibility to meet all the needs of Nevada patients while allowing for reliability and consistency of product in effect, aesthetics, smell, taste, and length of effect.”</p>
<p>But more importantly than lab-grade hydroponics, patients should seek out medicine from Evergreen Organix because, according to Barrick, “everyone on the Evergreen Organix and VonDank team truly cares that the patient is getting the cleanest possible medication grown using standards that meet and exceed their expectation.” </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>MAN’S BEST FRIEND FINDS RELIEF FROM DEBILITATING ILLNESS  WITH CBD OIL</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There is a reason we refer to dogs as man’s best friend. Or in Carrie Wilson’s (she prefers not to use her real name) case: mama’s boy. Dogs are loyal, caring, and playful and, at the end of the day, they are family.  </p>
<p>Tonka Wilson, 7, has never given her mom a reason to worry, aside from the occasional potty accidents in the house and torn up shoes left hidden under couches and beds. That is, until late in December 2015 when the beautiful Labrador-Pitbull mix had diarrhea and started vomiting.</p>
<p>“Sometimes dogs eat stuff they aren’t supposed to,” says Wilson about the week that Tonka’s medical mystery began. “But by the end of the first week in January, I started to get really concerned.” </p>
<p>Tonka’s vomiting episodes would happen up to 17 times in a row. He was puking more out than he was taking in, according to Wilson. “He wasn’t eating at all. He just stopped.”</p>
<p>Wilson rushed her brown-eyed furry child to the vet, where Tonka was admitted for two days and put on IV drips before being sent home. This vet visit was the stressful precursor to a month of visits to vets, specialty vets and a battery of tests.</p>
<p>By the end of January, Wilson could see Tonka’s backbones and hip bones protruding. The once energetic and infinitely-hungry dog was down 25 lbs., malnourished, and hooked to a feeding tube.</p>
<p>After seeing more than five vets and undergoing exploratory surgery, Wilson was no closer to finding the cause of Tonka’s symptoms. </p>
<p>Tonka even spent a week at a specialty center. “At this point, our main concern was stabilizing him,” says Wilson. But after each visit, Wilson and Tonka were sent home with no answers. Identical to the days following Tonka's return home from previous vet stays, he still could not keep food down.</p>
<p>Still in the dark about Tonka’s condition, Wilson began doing what most mothers would do in this situation: blame themselves. “You start to second guess what you fed him that week. Was it my fault?”</p>
<p>Nothing was working. “We were just shooting blind. All this money was spent and we still had no idea what was happening to our Tonka.”</p>
<p>Wilson decided that enough was enough. “No more biopsies, scopes, x-rays or ultrasounds,” explains a frustrated Wilson. Despite her skepticism, she reached out to Lance Parvin, who is known for his expertise in Herbal Psychopharmacology.</p>
<p>Parvin introduced Wilson and Tonka to CBD oil. Within two days of trying the oil on Tonka, Wilson noticed he was regaining his appetite. Wilson said the change was night and day.</p>
<p>“I was skeptical about it working,” explains Wilson, who has a background in biology, “but if we hadn’t tried the CBD oil, I don’t think Tonka would be here today.”</p>
<p>The treatment is both easy and effective. Tonka gets 0.1 ml of CBD oil rubbed onto his gums every night before he eats. </p>
<p>Tonka’s recovery has been slow. But according to Wilson, after a month of CBD oil treatment, he’s back to eating two cups of food, sleeping again, and his energy has returned. </p>
<p>“We spent over $7,000 in treatments and tests,” says Wilson. “All this time the cure was so simple. I’m a believer now!”  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nevada voters to decide whether or not to end cannabis prohibition</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Nevadans will have the opportunity to vote on whether or not to legalize cannabis for adult use this November.</p>
<p>The Nevada Marijuana Legalization Initiative is on the ballot as a result of an initiative petition -- meaning enough signatures of registered voters were collected in order for it to appear on the ballot for the state’s residents to weigh in on. In order for the initiative petition to pass, a majority of Nevada voters who show up to the polls on November 8th will have to support the ballot question. </p>
<p>The measure would legalize one ounce or less of marijuana for recreational use in the State of Nevada for individuals at least 21 years of age or older. The marijuana could only be grown, produced, tested and sold in licensed facilities. Those licenses would be awarded to applicants utilizing a merit-based system. The initiative petition limits the number of licenses that will be granted for the adult-use market. </p>
<p>Nevada already has a medical marijuana program and it will remain in place. The medical marijuana market has a 2 percent excise tax that is paid to the state and goes into the general education fund. If adult-use passes in November, the excise tax on adult-use product will be 15 percent. This tax will go into the general education fund as well and could produce millions of dollars to help improve and support K-12 education in Nevada. </p>
<p>Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska are states that have previously passed laws allowing for the adult use of cannabis. In the first year of having legalized adult use, Colorado received over $60 million in tax revenue and saw a reduction in the crime rate.1  Oregon saw sales in excess of $11 million in the first week of adult-use.2  Such revenue could be a significant boost to the economy and educational system in Nevada. </p>
<p>Thus, voters have a few short months to decide if Nevada should legalize cannabis for adult use. </p>]]></content:encoded>

Goldwater cites Inyo’s budtenders as one of the dispensary’s more extraordinary aspects because they are so knowledgeable, noting that, “The time they spend getting acclimated to the different products, terpene profiles, and the interaction with patients -- that’s what makes Inyo much, much different than other places. It’s an emotional purchase, people are scared and they want to feel comfortable. They want to deal with people they know and like. We want our budtenders to be friends with the patients.”

“Our patients rely on our budtenders so we really make an effort to make sure we find people who are knowledgeable of the industry. We give them time and opportunity to educate themselves about the products and to do their own research on terpene profiles and different strains. I think that really shows and gives patients confidence in their ability to make recommendations,” said David Goldwater, partner.

Inyo opened only last fall but they have already made renovations, recently installing a new area in the dispensary’s lobby where patients can view videos to educate themselves about everything from cooking with marijuana-infused products to dabbing. Inyo also offers an online course that patients can take about general laws and regulations of what they can and cannot do.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Denver-based O.penVAPE, in partnership with Nevada medical cannabis company TGIG, has begun producing and distributing O.penVAPE’s CO2 extracted cannabis oils in Southern Nevada dispensaries. </p>
<p>Demetri Kouretas, CEO of TGIG, said its relationship with O.penVAPE will make it possible for patients to obtain cannabis oil processed through CO2 extraction, a pure and safer form of cannabis oil. </p>
<p>His company has begun wholesaling O.penVAPE products to dispensaries that include Euphoria Wellness, Inyo Fine Cannabis, Nevada Pure and the Grove.</p>
<p>“Employing the science and technology that O.penVAPE has perfected, we are manufacturing superior cannabis oil for customers who have been requesting a way to ingest cannabis in safer measured doses,” Kouretas said, adding that TGIG has already produced O.penVAPE Reserve pure-oil and O.penVAPE strain-specific CO2 extracted oils in 250 mg cartridges. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The state has changed the grace period for medical cannabis cardholders who are in receipt of their approval letter but have yet to receive their card from the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). Medical marijuana patients may purchase in dispensaries using their approval letter for 60 days from the letter’s date of issuance, allowing patients access to medicine until they receive their medical marijuana card from the Nevada DMV.</p>
<p>Prior to this provision, newly-approved patients had a 14-day grace period during which they could purchase medical marijuana in a dispensary with their approval letter. </p>
<p>The grace period has been extended to 60 days and goes into effect immediately. This extension also applies to already-issued approval letters that bear the language “14-day grace period.”</p>
<p>Beyond 60 days of the date on the approval letter, a valid medical marijuana card issued by the Nevada DMV is required to purchase medical marijuana at Nevada dispensaries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nevada’s Division of Public and Behavioral Health now offers online registering for patients wishing to apply for a medical marijuana card. New applicants can now register and create a profile, scan and upload their driver’s license and download and print the medical marijuana card application from an online portal. This will save applicants the time of sending the Division an application packet request, and waiting to receive it in the mail.  </p>
<p>Future additions to the online registration portal will include online payments, upload of application documents, application status checking, application renewals, and cardholder history of dispensary purchases.</p>
<p>To use the online registry, applicants will need to photograph or scan their driver’s license, save it in an electronic file, and upload it to the application pages. Applicants who do not have electronic access will still be able to request an application packet using this form.   </p>
<p>The online registration portal can be accessed at <a href="https://mmportal.nv.gov/Account/Login" title="View">https://mmportal.nv.gov/Account/Login</a>, and then click on ‘Register as a Cardholder.’ </p>

Why did you decide to make cannabis policy the focus of your study? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">

In late 2012 right around the time Colorado and Washington were about to vote on legalization measures, a colleague and I had a conversation about the work I do on presidential power, administration, and regulation. And he asked if had ever thought of looking at cannabis? I said, ‘No, I really haven’t.’ He said no one is studying governance issues around this, everyone is studying the safety side, economic side or the movement side of it, but no one is thinking about the reality that states are going to have to start implementing this if they pass it. 
So I bounced the idea around and decided to take a look at the policy surrounding cannabis because I didn’t know that much about it. As I looked at it, I realized there were going to be a lot of challenges and this was not going to be an easy thing to do because it’s a brand-new policy area and no one’s done anything like this before. And then as Colorado and Washington legalized I got to work and started to focus on governance and implementation issues and eventually that grew into a broader portfolio of politics and other parts of the policy which is something I am very comfortable with -- whether government works effectively -- and I applied it to this very interesting, very unique policy area. I began as someone who studies government and now I feel more at home saying I am somebody who studies cannabis.

How have you seen attitudes change since you first started studying cannabis policy in 2012? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I don’t know if it’s been too dramatic in terms of public polling. In 2012 legalization nationwide had majority support, it does still today. What has changed is people’s opposition to it has dampened a bit. Even if they still oppose it, they are looking around the country and seeing that the sky isn’t falling. They see it as something they dislike, something they don’t want their kids to have, something that they think presents a public health or safety issue but they don’t see it with such a guttural instinctual dislike that they are going to get organized or riled up. It’s not like what we see as far as the opposition to the Affordable Care Act or other really hot-button issues like immigration reform. It’s something that people who like it, still like it and still support it and people who oppose it do so with less passion these days. It’s a similar trend to what is happening with same-sex marriage. 
There are a lot of reasons for us to think there will be changes on opinion just based on generational replacement. The people most opposed to marijuana are 65 and older. It’s the only age group in the U.S. with less than majority support. They are dying off and as they do, they are being replaced in the electorate by those turning 18, and these people have the strongest support for marijuana legalization which is well over 70 percent nationwide. For every 100 people who die of old age, they are being replaced by 100 18 year olds. You are losing people who oppose marijuana legalization at 35 percent and replacing them with people who support it at 75 percent -- that’s a huge shift in public opinion. You don’t have to change minds, you just have to change the people in the electorate -- and that’s a lot easier.

How many states will have adult-use questions on the ballot this November?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Obviously Nevada will. Massachusetts almost certainly will. I would be shocked if California didn’t, they look pretty well positioned. I think those are the three states most likely to be on the ballot and most likely to pass as well. 
I think Maine is likely going to miss the ballot. Florida is going to have a medical initiative on its ballot. I think Arizona might have adult use but it’s a tough state in terms of getting initiatives on the ballot. They have had some internal bickering there because different parts of the legalization movement haven’t been able to coalescence around wording and that’s presented a challenge in a way that the movement needs unification. A movement with one voice is much easier to advance causes and so Arizona is a possibility, but it’s not as certain as Nevada, Massachusetts or California.

What do you predict will happen in Nevada with regard to Adult-Use this November? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It’s hard to see a path that defeats the initiative in Nevada. Between now and November, I think if there was some sort of really tragic situation that arose because of medical marijuana there might be an outside shot that could defeat the legalization measure.
But it’s a presidential election year, the electorate is going to be younger, less white, more liberal. There will be a lot of money being put behind the initiative and not a ton of money being put up to oppose it, or that would be my guess, because that’s how it is in most states. Nevada is a changing place, it’s much more liberal in general than it used to be, it’s much more Democratic and the people here, their liberalism motivates them to vote and there are a lot of Libertarians here. And Libertarians, even if they don’t like marijuana legalization, they like government regulation or intrusion less. You can imagine people who don’t like it, don’t want to use it, don’t care for it -- voting in favor of legalization just to get the government out of the business, which, in some ways, is ironic because it’s actually a heavily regulated product.

How do you think casino magnate and cannabis opponent Sheldon Adelson will factor in?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Obviously he opposes it. He opposed the medical initiative in Florida and that was a big reason why it was defeated, but it was barely defeated. Mr. Adelson is somebody who will probably throw some money behind opposing it but his money worked in Florida because it was so unexpected. Now a lot of people in the movement are prepared for him to spend in Nevada and they are planning accordingly. They were sort of caught off guard in Florida and they didn’t respond effectively. When you are thrown a political curveball in the last few months of an election and you are not prepared, it’s a fast track to losing and the Florida medical supporters lost as a result. I don’t think Adelson’s money will be as effective in Nevada as it was in Florida unless he starts to spend exorbitant amounts of money, if he throws $30, $40 $50 million dollars behind it, you could then maybe see it having an effect. But if he does something similar to what he did in Florida (Adelson spent approximately $3 million on Florida), I think it’s just not going to be effective.

When do you think the federal prohibition on cannabis will end? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I put a poll question on Capitol Bells directed at the staff and aides of Congressional legislators. The poll question was basically: Do your bosses, who oppose marijuana, oppose it because of policy concerns or political concerns? 
It was insanely overwhelmingly political, members of Congress are not concerned about the policy around it at all. A lot of them thought the 5- to 10-year window for lifting prohibition on cannabis was right. And I think it is too. Congress is so slow to catch up with public opinion. Public opinion is already there on medical marijuana and Congress hasn’t acted in an aggressive way. There’s more than 80 percent support nationwide, and the majority support it in every state that it has ever been in. You have an institution that is always behind the ball in terms of public opinion so you are going to need a little bit more time. 
Congress will be pushed along by three things. One is going to be sheer public opinion, which is going to be increasingly supportive of marijuana legalization as time goes on. The second is going to be that they  see the sky isn’t falling and it’s not as bad as they thought it was going to be. They will see that’s it something they can find palatable or at least something that policy dysfunction between state and federal is so wide that they really need to act to clean it up. The last is going to be that as more states legalize, there’s going to be more of an industry at the table that can have some influence. And the interests of a sitting Congressman are going to change when all of a sudden his constituents depend on it as an industry. As more states start to legalize it, we have already seen members of Congress, whose states have marijuana, start to change their tune a little bit. When bigger states like California and Massachusetts crossover that’s going to be motivation for legislators but it will take time. But that 5- to 10-year window is probably a pretty good guess at some substantial reform. Will they (Congress) get it right? Absolutely not, because at the end of the day, it’s still Congress.

Why do you think the nation has started to soften its stance toward the legalization of cannabis?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

There are a few reasons for that. The first is the demographic change I already mentioned. It’s just a matter of different people being asked about it than were asked about it 10 years ago. But even within the groups that have lower levels of support for marijuana than Millennials, for instance, you see minds changing too. If you trace those demographic groups through time they are starting to soften their stance as well. So people in the ‘90s who were in the 35- to 49-age demographic, if you look at them now they are in their late 60s, their support is higher as a group than it was 20 years ago. And part of that are people seeing that the drug wars failed, and that usage rates are not affected by government intervention. And in terms of people from minority race and ethnicities, they are looking at prohibition devastating their communities, sending people to jail, putting them at a lower chance of getting jobs because they have a criminal record. 
People used to think of legal marijuana as something that was a very one-sided, simple issue: Should it be legal or shouldn’t it be? But now people are thinking more of it as a public policy and thinking about the different ways that it can affect society, either positively or negatively. When you look it at that way, it’s less about pot and it’s more about freedom, equality, justice or economics. There’s a whole variety of ways you can look at this issue and come to yes and it can be very different than the person sitting across the table from you or the person next to you on the bus. And for the movement, all they need is for you to say yes. You don’t have to agree with the why. A black guy who is 25 is probably going to support it for a very different reason than a 75-year-old rancher, but they both support it and that’s all you need. As people start to think of it in more dynamic ways, they are finding a basis to support it in a way they never had before.

What about rescheduling cannabis to a Schedule 2 drug? When do you foresee that happening? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

That’s going to come faster than anything else. You have presidential candidates openly supporting it. Clinton does, who is more likely than anyone to become president. Sanders does, to. 
I think Trump is being guarded, as a candidate sometimes is in a presidential primary, but at the end of the day he is a businessman and he’s going to look at it through an economic lens. He might come out in opposition to it but his more extreme views on issues like immigration and foreign policy are not necessary the type of views that would extend to this. It’s an industry, and I think he’s going to look at it and he can be convinced that it is something that needs reform. I think a place like Nevada, where there’s a lot of wealthy people who are interested in getting into this industry. And those are the type of people Donald Trump would look to and recognize these are not stoners, these are businessmen and I am a businessman not a stoner so let’s at least get government out of this. Maybe Donald Trump will be the guy who makes marijuana great again, I don’t know. But the much more likely scenario is that a Democrat will be elected president and Clinton has been very open about her views on rescheduling. 
The harder sell is that members of Congress don’t understand scheduling or rescheduling, and I know that firsthand. There’s this idea that if you move marijuana from Schedule 1 to 2 all of sudden it’s legalized -- this is the disconnect. So I have worked really hard to try to communicate with members of Congress that that is not how that works but it’s a bit of a misnomer. When you frame it as something that will assist the conduction of research, people love it but when you just say rescheduling they think all of sudden America is going to become Colorado. 
The more informed members get about scheduling, the better chances there is for Congress to act but at the end of the day the next president is going to think through his or her picks for attorney general, DEA chief, Secretary of Health & Human Services, FDA head, with this in mind. Because all of those people on the administrative side play such a role in a way that was not the case for President Obama when he took office. There is a real groundswell for reform in this area. As he was thinking through his appointments, marijuana was not really on the table for him but for the new president it will be. And there will be a lot of people from industry, interest groups and elsewhere who are going to be pushing the president-elect to not select top tier presidential appointments based on marijuana, but at least have it as a consideration in the same way they will be considering criminal justice reform, immigration policy – it just becomes a question to ask of a prospective nominee. And if the nominee opposes marijuana rescheduling entirely, they are not going to get the job especially in a Democratic administration. So that puts cannabis in a tier of policy seriousness that it has never had before.

What is the most important public policy issue cannabis will have to overcome in order for prohibition to be lifted? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Usage rates are really important, whether it’s among adults or children. As states begin to legalize, the biggest concern is that kids are all of sudden going to start using marijuana. I think there is a real concern that it is going to be abused, and it’s going to be a serious burden on mental health and addiction services. I think a lot of those concerns are unwarranted but they are still concerns. So when I talk to people in the industry or in the movement, they’ll say marijuana is not as addicting as alcohol or it’s not going to lead to increases in children’s use. But people think it does and you have to address that and you have to overcome that. You can’t just say it’s not true so we don’t have to think about it. It’s true if people think it’s true in a political sense. And so as data increases from the states who have legalized, it gives people in the movement and people trying to change minds an additional tool in the conversation or the argument. The data that has come out of Washington and Colorado so far has been politicized. There are groups like Project Sam that cherry picks data and only tells half of the story, but there are groups like MMP and Norml who cherry pick data to tell the story they want to tell, too. It’s being very politicized.
It’s going to take people from independent organizations that can do the research when state governments issue reports to present the information unbiased about what marijuana is doing to each state. Maybe it’s a public nuisance or public safety issue and if it is, people should know that but if it’s actually not and it’s an economic driver and its employing women and people of color and young people and it’s leading to profits in the market and the secondary market and tertiary market than people need to know that, too. I think it’s one of those rare occasions where more data is going to help convince people whether it’s data in a traditional sense, dollars and cents, statistics on use, abuse, public safety and health or more anecdotal data or more experiential data. I think as people come in to contact with it and the systems that are around it, they are impressed by it. Once people tour a dispensary and see it firsthand or go on a tour of a cultivation facility, they gain a greater respect for it, a greater appreciation and, most importantly, a better understanding.
It’s in the same way people who have a child who comes out or people who have neighbors who are gay, when they start to experience who people in the LGBT community are, you realize they are not these terrible pedophiles who are out to ruin your marriage and society, you realize they are people just like you, they just have a different preference in terms of love. That experience we know has had a tremendous effect on changing minds on the issue of same-sex marriage and I think in a similar way, as people become more acquainted with the system whether it’s because of personal use or just observation or observation of people who use, that helps to break down barriers. When adult-use marijuana is the product that a soccer mom is enjoying or a businessman after work is using, and people start to think of cannabis like a glass of wine you start to think of it less as a college-age stoner’s couch-lock device. You opinion around it changes dramatically because of a different understanding of the product.

What about the industry’s banking conundrum? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It’s tough, I don’t blame bankers for what they doing. It’s a real risk for them. They are reacting out of fear and they are reacting in ways that hurt their clients but they are reacting as a result of federal policy that does not speak in one effective voice. You have federal policy that says it is okay to have a cannabis enterprise as long as you meet the eight guidelines in the Cole Memo but you can’t have a bank. The lack of banking, of course, means businesses are more prone to the concerns outlined in the Cole Memo and so this is a really serious catch-22. I think one of two things will happen in terms of reform. Either Congress is going to act in a way that resolves this conflict. It’s one of the issues that is getting rapid support in Congress, although not necessarily enough to reform things now. But it’s an issue that is really easy to sell to a Congressman, from what I have heard, because it’s an economic issue and a public safety issue. And if we are going to have this environment where we allow this, we ought to allow these enterprises to have financial products. So Congressmen are coming around on this point and so maybe reform will happen that way. 
The other way reform can happen is very informal. And that is for Bank of America or Wells Fargo or Chase to just come out one day and say we are working with the cannabis industry now and there’s nothing you are going to do about it. The federal government is not going to seize the assets of Bank of America because it’s starting to give checking accounts to cannabis enterprises. That would be something that would really shift policy. That would be something that, my guess is, Congress and/or the Federal Reserve would play catch-up on and seriously look at reform because one of their largest banking enterprises is now doing this. That is going to happen when a bank sees a profit in it and that will only happen as more states come online and the industry grows. At the end of the day, it’s economic rationality that will drive a bank to do it, but they are not there yet. Banks, despite the financial crisis, still are a bit risk adverse and this is risk they are just not convinced of yet. But it will certainly be a risk they will be willing to take at some point.

<h2>PENNSYLVANIA</h2>
As of April 17, Pennsylvania is the 24th state to legalize medical marijuana. Democrats and Republicans flanked Governor Wolf as he made history in Harrisburg and signed the Medical Marijuana Act (SB 3) into law. With the enactment of Pennsylvania’s law, more than half of all Americans will live in a medical marijuana state. Supporters from both parties lobbied to legalize medical marijuana in Pennsylvania. With a prescription, patients suffering from 17 conditions, including seizures, cancer and chronic pain, will have access to medical marijuana. The DOH has been given the power to authorize up to 150 dispensaries across the state. Pennsylvania’s law takes effect next month and then the department of health has six months to craft temporary regulations.

<h2>OREGON</h2>
Governor Kate Brown signed four pieces of cannabis-related legislation this year, including two last month. HB 4094 will ensure that financial institutions serving both medical and nonmedical cannabis businesses will not be subject to state criminal laws. SB 1524 will make it easier for veterans who receive services from the VA health system to renew medical marijuana registrations. SB 1511 includes provisions that will allow businesses serving adult consumers to provide medical marijuana products. It will also allow medical marijuana dispensaries to sell concentrates to adult consumers. Along with other changes, HB 4014 allows out-of-state investors to invest in marijuana-related businesses.

<h2>LOUISIANA</h2>
In March, Mayor Mitch Landrieu signed into law an ordinance decriminalizing marijuana possession in the city of New Orleans. The City Council unanimously passed Councilwoman Susan Guidry’s measure, which would become Sec. 54-505 of the NOLA Code. The ordinance reduces penalties if convicted in court with offenders being subject to the following fines: $40 for a first offense, $60 for a second, $80 for a third, and $100 for any subsequent offenses. Offenders would not be subject to jail time, and courts would be given the discretion to impose alternative penalties — such as community service — for those defendants who cannot afford to pay fines. The measure expands upon a 2010 law, also sponsored by Guidry, that currently gives New Orleans police officers (NOPD) the discretion to issue a summons to appear in court instead of making an arrest for a first-time marijuana possession offense and is extended to all subsequent marijuana possession offenses.The ordinance will go into effect on June 21st.

<h2>NEW YORK</h2>
In mid-April, the Assembly Health Committee advanced two pieces of legislation that would expand the state’s medical marijuana program. The bills, sponsored by Assemblyman Dick Gottfried, who chairs the chamber's health committee and is one of the architects of the state’s Compassionate Care Act, would eliminate the requirement that the registered organizations charged with growing and distributing marijuana be vertically integrated and would also double the amount of companies in the state’s program. Gottfried’s bill would increase medical cannabis companies that are currently operating in the state from four to eight. According to Politico New York, both bills were reported out of committee, readying them for a vote on the Assembly floor.

<h2>SOUTH CAROLINA</h2>
The South Carolina Senate Medical Affairs Committee voted 9-2 against the South Carolina Medical Marijuana Program Act (S. 672), killing the legislation. There is a possibility the House will take action on its version of the bill — H. 4037 — which was approved by a House subcommittee by a vote of 3-1 last year. House Bill 4037 would allow patients with certain serious medical conditions to use and safely access medical cannabis. In addition, the legislation would create a regulated system of access through growers, processors, dispensers, and certified labs.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“It’s been a nightmare,” said 56-year-old Janie Jones, “I was actually at the point where I would just go back to bed every morning and be in tears and isolate myself for the last 20 years.” </p>
<p>Jones (who asked that her real name not be used) has suffered from major depressive disorder for two decades. “It started when I went into perimenopause. I thought the best way to treat it was to try antidepressants and I am treatment-resistant and so after a couple of years of taking them that did not work for me,” she explained. “I have had horrible, horrible experiences trying to take medication for depression and anxiety and it has just caused worse side effects including neuropathy. After taking horrible mediation for so many years, I couldn’t even fall asleep at night because my legs were just in so much pain.” </p>
<p>Jones, who has never had a drink in her life nor a cigarette, definitely had never considered cannabis as a solution for her. “The bottom line is medical marijuana is something that really wasn’t even in my brain. I never even thought of doing anything like that,” she said. “I told my doctor, I wouldn’t want to go down to one of those dispensaries. I just didn’t want to smoke anything. It’s just not me.”</p>
<p>But the native Las Vegan kept hearing positive things about medical cannabis. “Finally I was so desperate, I was ready to try anything so we decided to see if I could even get a medical marijuana card. I told my psychiatrist and he was 100% supportive. He said, ‘Janie, if you can find anything that helps you I am behind you all the way.’ I am lucky he is very open-minded compared to many doctors.” </p>
<p>Last October, Jones started taking a gel cap of CBD oil before she went to bed each night. “Once I started taking it, I was immediately able to fall asleep and shut my brain off because the pain immediately went away. Being able to fall asleep the very first night of taking it was like a miracle,” she recalled.  </p>
<p>“Of course not,” Jones said emphatically as to whether she thought it would work or not. “I felt like I had done it all and this wouldn’t work either. It’s been slow but I am starting to see other progressive, good things happening other than not having the pain and being able to sleep at night. I am finally able to function a little bit better,” explained Jones, who recently started working two to three days a week. </p>
<p>After her success with CBD oil, Jones has changed her mind about cannabis. “Now my belief is I am taking something that is natural and plant-based, that’s not killing me like all the other stuff I have taken,” she acknowledged. “It has really changed my quality of life tremendously. I still have a ways to go to where I want to be but it’s nice to not have pain and to be able to sleep.</p>
<p>“CBD oil has been the biggest blessing ever,” she concluded. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I first started using cannabis for medicinal purposes 10 years ago, no one talked about CBD. The discovery of the chemical compound wasn’t yet common knowledge and, even, today most people aren’t aware of the important role CBD plays in the medicinal use of cannabis and how it translates into a practical application. Making matters worse, the hype surrounding CBD only adds to the confusion of what, otherwise, really should be seen as the graceful simplicity (and perfection) of nature. Simply put, cannabis is a whole-plant medicine.    </p>
<p>Keep in mind that when discussing CBD-rich applications, we’re generally speaking about    edible extractions or infusions made from the leaves of the cannabis plant, not the ripened flowers or buds. It’s been well-documented through chemical analysis that the leaves of the cannabis plant run a much richer CBD to THC ratio than the flowers themselves, and the CBD to THC ratio is what ultimately dictates an extraction’s (or infusion’s) ability to act as an effective pain regulator and psychoactive potentiate. </p>
<p>What does this mean in a practical sense? It means medical patients primarily rely upon the leaves of the cannabis plant in making the most effective edible medicines, not the bud. General consensus agrees cannabis potency is measured through THC levels. But what isn’t as widely understood is that in order to ingest and maintain higher (medicinal) levels of THC comfortably, one must also ingest a quantity of CBD. This is especially true when it comes to eating cannabis. Patients who ingest high doses of THC often experience confusion, tension, anxiety, nausea, or paranoia, as the higher psychoactive levels of THC enter the bloodstream and begin to take hold.  </p>
<p>But CBD, when utilized properly, acts as a symbiotic modulator bringing a calming balance to THC levels allowing for synergistic cooperation between cannabinoids. By nature’s careful design, CBD grants THC a relaxed audience which, in turn, encourages better healing. This is why all medical patients who suffer from maladies and require the ingestion of high and/or prolonged levels of THC must learn to understand CBD’s important contribution to the healing process. Patients should learn how to achieve the right cannabinoid profile intake or they’ll experience uneasy feelings which could ultimately cause them to lower the effective dose or stop using cannabis.</p>
<p>Because medicinal application(s) not only must be effective in treating maladies, but also address the patient’s personal preference to THC tolerance levels, cannabis is a highly personalized medicine that requires depth of understanding. Sensitivity to THC and its psychoactive effects is a key factor in determining an appropriate CBD to THC ratio and in setting the dosage of CBD-rich cannabis medicine. Even at a 1:1 ratio, which is considered to be CBD-potent, patients must already be very accustomed and comfortable with experiencing the “high” associated with THC.  Whereas an 18:1 concentration of CBD:THC is reportedly the ideal starting point for patients who don’t want to experience any psychoactive effect.</p>
<p>So now that you know “CBD-rich” literally translates into “made using leaves,” you should be able to glean just some of the struggle many medical cannabis patients now face in Nevada. When legislation removed the patients’ right to grow, creators of the law didn’t understand how cannabis is used as a whole-plant medicine. As a result, the dispensaries in Nevada are currently restricted in selling cannabis flowers (i.e. bud), but medical cannabis patients need access to leaves, whole plants, and fresh, unprocessed plant matter in order to cook it, eat it, and juice it in its freshest form. </p>
<p>That’s just one of the reasons that when it comes to the truth about CBD and how it relates to medical cannabis patients, things tend to get a little complicated. But the fact is cannabis is a whole-plant medicine.      </p>
<p>A licensed medical cannabis patient since 2008, Mona Lisa Samuelson was Nevada’s first medical cannabis patient advocate and started her own YouTube channel, MonaLisaLuvsMaryJane, for patients in search of practical cannabis knowledge.  </p>

		<title>SILVER SAGE WELLNESS OPENS WITH FOCUS ON CBD-SPECIFIC MEDICINE</title>
		<link>https://elevatenv.com/silver-sage-wellness-opens-with-focus-on-cbd-specific-medicine/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“If we could wave a magic wand and be known for something at the end of the day, we want to be known as the place to come for medicinal purposes and for being able to offer high-end unique products,” said Braly Joy, general manager of Silver Sage Wellness dispensary, located at Charleston and Decatur.</p>
<p>Because Silver Sage Wellness has both cultivation and production licenses they are in the position to put their money where their mouth is and develop their own custom products, primarily with a CBD focus. Of the 42 strains Silver Sage is currently growing in their 26,000-square-foot facility, five are CBD-specific and four more CBD-dominant strains are on the way. </p>
<p>“CBD and medicinal products is what Silver Sage Wellness is all about, all the way through. They (owners Jim and Pam Blasco) got into this business specifically for those reasons. It was only after they did much research and looked into it thoroughly that they even got involved in this industry,” said Joy. “They want to do everything they can to bring it to Las Vegas and especially to the special needs community. We are working as hard as we can to find groups to try and get some studies and testing going so that we can find ways to utilize CBD and cannabis in general to help patients find alternative methods.”</p>
<p>Some of the alternative methods Silver Sage has been developing include pre-rolls that are a mix of strains. For instance, one of Silver Sage’s pre-rolls will contain CBD-dominant strain Channel 2 (a hybrid of Charlotte’s Web), and ISS Island Sweet Skunk. Combining the two strains allows the pre-roll to potentially treat seizures, anxiety, depression and anti-inflammatory issues. </p>
<p>“We are going to hand-roll them,” Joy offered of the pre-rolls. “Instead of throwing the two strains in together and just grinding it up and making pre-rolls that way, we want to make sure it is fairly consistent and all the way through the pre-roll so that when you are smoking it, you aren’t getting hits of just the THC strain and the next few hits are just CBD. We want to have those burn together as easily as we can.”</p>
<p>Uncommon to mix strains in a pre-roll, Joy has “never seen it done for the purpose of mixing in CBD to create that entourage effect.”  </p>
<p>Silver Sage Wellness will also have its own version of Rick Simpson Oil (RSO). Named for the Blasco’s oldest son who is autistic, Jimmy B Oil has been testing at a CBD:THC ratio that is 10 to 1. The dispensary will also offer wax and shatter in CBD-specific strains ACDC and Channel 2.</p>
<p>“We don’t even know if there is a market out there for it,” Joy said of the concentrates, “But we will put it out there and if people really do want that high dosage of CBD-specific concentrated cannabinoid profiles than we are going to have that available. </p>
<p>“I am hoping we can keep pushing the envelope with CBDs and cannabinoid profiles and continue to come up with alternatives,” concluded Joy. </p>

		<title>Patient Primer: THE WHEEL DEAL FOR CHARTING A COURSE OF TREATMENT WITH CANNABIS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are new to the world of medicating with cannabis, it can be much like falling down a rabbit hole overrun with an alphabet soup of acronyms like CBD, CBN, CBG, THC and THCA. Figuring out which one or ones will treat your particular symptoms or disease can be a confusing prospect. </p>
<p>  Cannabis wheels have become a popular source of information for patients, caregivers, and physicians seeking that knowledge. These visual aids are popular because they illustrate the wide spectrum of cannabinoids and the various conditions they treat.  </p>
<p>The main focus of the visual aids are cannabinoids which are chemical compounds that bind to cannabinoid receptors in the body and affect neurotransmitter production, cannabinoid transportation, and chemical reaction at the cannabinoid receptors. To date there have been over 100 cannabinoids identified in the cannabis plant with the two most well-known being Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).1 </p>
<a href="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CBD_Wheel.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3229"><img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/CBD_Wheel.jpg" alt="CBD_Wheel"  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3229 img-responsive" /></a>
<p>Cannabinoids can be categorized by their origin: endocannabinoids are synthetized in the body, plants produce phytocannabinoids, and synthetic cannabinoids are manufactured artificially. </p>
<p>Cannabinoids exert their effect by interacting with a complex system in the body called the endocannabinoid system (ECS), which interacts with virtually every other organ system in the body. Cannabinoids bind to specific receptors called endocannabinoid receptors (CB-1 and CB-2), which are present in different concentrations throughout the body. </p>
<p>For example, there is an abundance of CB-1 receptors in the brain while CB-2 receptors are primarily expressed in the immune system. The affinity of different cannabinoids at these receptor points can lead to various outcomes observed with different strains. THC and CBD are the two major phytocannabinoids. Synthetic cannabinoids are either chemically similar to THC (Marinol) or to endocannabinoids.  </p>
<p>  As more researchers look at cannabinoids other than THC, or even more closely at CBD, new information is being discovered as far as their efficacy in treating certain symptoms and ailments. Several companies have taken on the arduous task of developing tools to aid in the classification and grouping of different cannabinoids. One such chart (see page 26) shows the benefit of several different types of cannabinoids. Of all the cannabinoids listed in this chart, Δ9-THC and CBD are the ones with the most robust research behind them. </p>
<p>Leafly.com2 has also created a helpful chart that is more extensive in the symptoms and medical conditions that can be treated using different cannabinoids.</p>
<a href="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Leafly-wheel.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-3227"><img src="http://elevatenv.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Leafly-wheel.jpg" alt="Leafly wheel"  class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3227 img-responsive" /></a>
<p>The most comprehensive tool is the interactive Weed Wheel by CannabiScope3 found at www.cannabiscope.com. This interactive chart allows the user to start with either the medical condition or the flavor of the strain. The health section is further divided by physical or mental symptoms, or the user can chose specific therapies such as pain relief or sleep aid. Eventually subdivisions lead to an array of strains that have been reported to work for the certain symptom the user has chosen. Once a strain is identified, some information on the properties of the strain can be obtained.</p>
<p> The exact cannabinoid composition of each strain will be a key factor in the future for standardization of strain classification. In turn, patients will not have to rely on just a strain name. For individuals who prefer to choose a particular flavor to reach a similar endpoint, they can start with the flavor section of CannabiScope’s Wheel. This is a great tool to help patients, caregivers, physicians, and cannabis aficionados obtain valuable information on cannabis. However, the general classification of such strains needs to be looked at cautiously. There are many generalized claims associated with specific strains. The composition makeup of the strains is important as many strains might bear the same name and have a completely different composition of cannabinoids. </p>
<p>Because Nevada requires strict laboratory testing of cannabis, medicine that is sold here will offer strain consistency and reproducibility values with certain cannabinoid concentrations documented on the label. With further research, the amount of information that will be available to patients and healthcare providers will further aid in narrowing the scope of cannabis-based treatments.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By its very nature, the cannabis industry has always drawn those who don’t accept the norm, who seek new ways of doing things. That inclination can extend to the medicine itself because, while cannabis may be good for you, the usual way of consuming it—smoking—isn’t so salubrious. Here are three companies who are trying to make taking your medicine easier and healthier.</p>
<p> Edibles can sometimes be a bit difficult to manage—dosing can be uncertain in prepackaged products and all manner of things can go wrong while making them at home. Pot-O-Coffee tries to make it as easy as possible, with cannabis-infused coffee in a Keurig-style cup.</p>
<p> Mark Englestead, founder of Pot-O-Coffee, cites “the convenience factor, the fact that most of the adult-use markets require single-serve portions” and “issues with proper dosing of edibles. It really made sense to focus on the single-serve product.” For those who only have a traditional coffee machine, Pot-O-Coffee is also available in one-serving pouches and they make tea, cocoa, and a decaf blend. Some of Englestead’s partners used to run a coffee company in Florida, so they are as familiar with the bean as they are the bud.</p>
<p> Pot-O-Coffee also offers CBD-specific products and is working on developing more variety in both flavors and medical effects. “We’re working on some limited-edition strain-specific blends—maybe a Chocolope chocolate coffee or a Tangie orange zinger tea,” says Englestead, adding that, “We want to use the purest possible concentrates and with current technology those very pure concentrates are kind of devoid of most of the terpenes and flavanoids…we’re looking at what terpenes we can add back in that will give a beneficial result without affecting the flavor of the coffee or tea.” Pot-O-Coffee is currently available in California, is expanding into Colorado and is hoping to finalize a deal for the Nevada market.</p>
<p> Many cannabis consumers are comfortable using the classic methods, but wish smoking could be a little less stressful on the lungs and other body parts. KashIt offers a variety of accessories that “make smoking more convenient,” according to John Sethi, president of KashIt Inventions, who wanted to find a method of “cooling the smoke down, making it smoother, easier on the patients…we felt that medicating, especially with herbs was very harsh on the lungs.” Thus, the KashIt Cool, a mouthpiece with a coil condenser chills the smoke, as well as antimicrobial properties.</p>
<p> “For patients with medical issues like arthritis or PTSD, our gadgets are actually very convenient for them,” says Sethi. KashIt makes a vacuum pipe/device cleaner that saves effort (and delicate glassware) and is developing an electronic grinder. “It’s targeted toward medical patients who have intense joint pain. It’s going to be the first USB rechargeable grinder where you simply press a button and it grinds your product for you,” he explains.</p>
<p> Of course there are some methods of smoking cannabis that go past modifications and straight into inventing something new. The CannaCloud is a vaporizer system that uses pre-packaged “cannacups” of product, much like a Keurig coffee machine. The idea was born when CannaKorp CIO Michael Bourque tried medical marijuana and found that the experience of buying and smoking it “was horrible,” he says, “I realized there isn’t a really simple way to do this. I tried 20 or so different types of vaporizers—every new one was like learning to play another musical instrument.”</p>
<p> Since Bourque is an engineer, he began building prototypes on a 3-D printer and had his eureka moment: “If we could put it in a small container, build a vaporizer, make these things work together—we could offer ease of use, simplicity, convenience, we could control dosage.”</p>
<p> Since CannaKorp, the development company is located in Boston, the home of Keurig, “we could leverage a lot of the ecosystem,” according to COO James Winokur, and former Keurig designers and executives have been involved in the project. “I think there’s a lot of room for different kinds of devices and delivery systems,” he says, “ours is a much more approachable, more controlled experience.” CannaCloud vaporizers and CannaCup pods will be available in dozens of strains and varieties in select markets in late 2016/early 2017.</p>
<p> “To do what we’re doing is pretty hard, but we’re going to make it easy for the consumer,” says Bourque. Sethi agrees, stating that “one of the things we’re most excited about is the untapped creativity in the market.” And who knows where—or what—that creativity will lead to next.</p>

		<title>Legalease: THE LAW AND DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CANNABIS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my law practice medical marijuana patients often approach me with questions regarding their rights. One issue that often comes up is whether or not a patient using cannabis is allowed to drive. The simple answer is that it is perfectly legal under Nevada state law for a medical marijuana patient to maintain their driver’s license. Unfortunately, the law regarding marijuana use and driving isn’t that simple and this article is meant to address common concerns associated with medical cannabis use and operating a motor vehicle. </p>
<h3 class="page-header">Can a medical marijuana patient be charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) of marijuana?</h3>
<p>Yes. Even though Nevada state law protects a legal marijuana patient’s right to use and possess marijuana for medical purposes, you can still be charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI) if you are found to be in “actual physical control” of a motor vehicle while under the influence of marijuana. Whether you are found to be in actual physical control of a vehicle depends on a variety of factors, but it is generally defined as the ability to make the vehicle operate. Nevada makes no distinction between illegal marijuana users and state legal medical marijuana patients when it comes to driving under the influence. Patients need to understand that a patient card offers no protection from prosecution for DUI. If you are found to be in actual physical control of a motor vehicle while under the influence of marijuana, you may be arrested and charged with DUI. </p>
<h3 class="page-header">What is driving while impaired? </h3>
<p>If a person cannot safely drive a motor vehicle due to the use of marijuana, or other drugs, they may be charged with a DUI. To be charged with driving while impaired, the arresting officer will look at the totality of the circumstances to determine if the drug/substance rendered the driver incapable of driving safely. The officer often determines your level of impairment through field sobriety tests (FST). Most people do not realize that a FST is optional and can be refused. Regardless, if you are found to be impaired to a degree that prevents you from operating your vehicle safely, you may be arrested and charged with DUI. </p>
<h3 class="page-header">What is a per se violation? </h3>
<p>Even if you are not impaired, you may be charged with, and convicted of, a DUI under a per se rule violation. The term per se is a Latin phrase that translates to “in itself.” With regard to a DUI charge, a per se violation occurs simply because you have greater than an arbitrarily set limit of a substance in your body at the time of the offense, even if you are not impaired at all. With respect to a marijuana DUI, if the prosecution can prove you had a certain amount of active marijuana, or marijuana metabolite, in your system while driving, they can establish a DUI per se violation. A demonstration of either of the following may result in a marijuana DUI conviction:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A marijuana concentration of two nanograms per milliliter of blood or more.</li>
  <li>A marijuana metabolite concentration of five nanograms per milliliter of blood.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, if you use cannabis for any reason, the chances are very good that you could trigger one of the per se limits and be convicted of a DUI even if you were not impaired at the time of your arrest. </p>
<h3 class="page-header">What can patients do to protect themselves and prevent a cannabis DUI?</h3>
<p>Obviously, you should never drive while under the influence of cannabis. If possible, never carry your medicine or paraphernalia in your vehicle, other than to transport your medicine from a dispensary to your home. Never store your medicine in plain view inside of your vehicle; if possible store your medicine in the trunk of your car in a locked case. Never smoke or otherwise use your medicine in your vehicle, even if it is parked. Do not notify the officer of your status as a medical marijuana patient unless you need to demonstrate the fact that you are legally allowed to possess cannabis. Do not consent to a search of your vehicle, home, or person. Never consent to a blood draw without a valid warrant. Remember, always be polite to the officer, there is no reason to instigate a confrontation. Finally, you have a constitutional right to remain silent, use it.  </p>
<p>If you have been charged with a DUI, contact Connor &amp; Connor at 702.750.9139 to discuss your options or email <a href="mailto:info@connorpllc.com">info@connorpllc.com</a>. </p>

<p>The perfect weather for cooking outdoors has arrived and nothing tastes better than a delicious burger right off the grill. Chef Sandra Mallut has shared a wonderful recipe that will take your Memorial Day celebration to the next level with a gourmet style burger full of the most flavorful toppings. You can also consider making potato chips for a tasty side. There are cannabis chips available or you can make your own by using cannabis oil to fry them. You can also whip up a batch of French fries by using frozen ones and adding your own season blend or just olive oil, salt and herbs. </p>

[one_half]
<h3>POTATO BUN INGREDIENTS (MAKES 3 DOZEN):</h3>
1 cup white sugar
1 cup russet mashed potatoes
1/2 cup vegetable shortening
3 eggs, beaten 
1-1/2 teaspoons kosher salt
1-1/2 to 2 packs instant yeast
1 cup warm water (can substitute ¼ cup of water for vegetable or beef broth for extra taste)
5 cups all-purpose flour (bread flour can make them tough)
1/8 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
Optional: You can also add fresh chopped herbs to the dough.

[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>BUN DIRECTIONS: </h3>
	<ul><li> Mix together sugar, potatoes, vegetable shortening, eggs, vanilla, and salt. Dissolve yeast in 1 cup warm water (broth); add to above mixture. Stir in about 3 cups flour (add the fresh chopped herbs here if using). Add the remaining 2 cups flour while kneading. Knead until the dough is no longer sticky but moist to touch. Let rise until doubled. Preheat oven to 325°F.</li>
<li> Roll out dough to a ¾- to 1-inch thickness. Cut into bun shapes with the bottom of a jar or a biscuit cutter and arrange about 2 inches apart on cookie sheets greased with cannabis butter. Let them rise until puffy but not doubled and try not to let them touch during baking.</li>
<li> Brush with cannabis butter. Bake until lightly golden brown, about 12 minutes. (Option: A couple of minutes before you take out of oven, sprinkle with kosher salt and put back into oven to bake a bit more for a salty taste.)</li>
</ul>
[/one_half_last]

<h3>BURGER PATTY  INGREDIENTS (MAKES 4 SERVINGS):</h3>
1 egg
½ kosher salt, season right before putting in pan
½ teaspoon ground black pepper (fresh is best), season right before putting in pan
1 lb. ground beef, 80/20 beef/fat blend 
½ cup breadcrumbs (with or without seasoning)
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1-2 Tablespoon(s) brown sugar, set extra aside to caramelize burger (optional)
pinch of red pepper flakes
¼ cup chopped par cooked bacon (it gets mixed into ground beef and will finish cooking in the burger)
6-8 bacon slices, cooked (hold aside for burger assembly)
⅛ - ¼ cup chopped browned red onion (sauté in cannabis butter)
pinch-1 teaspoon chopped Italian Parsley (or other fresh herbs you would like)
¼-½ teaspoon Dijon mustard
2–4 Tablespoons cannabis butter for brushing burger patties
[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>BURGER PATTY DIRECTIONS: </h3>
	<ul>
<li> Preheat grill or pan on high heat and be sure it’s lightly oiled (cannabis oil) so the burger patty does not stick and fall apart and cook unevenly.  </li>
<li> In a large bowl, add egg, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, herbs, red pepper flakes, sautéed or raw red onion, Dijon mustard, and set aside. Place ground beef, chopped bacon and breadcrumbs into the mixture with your hands or use a fork to blend ingredients well.</li>
<li> Form into 4 patties that are about ¾-inch thick with a thumbprint in middle of patty to leave an indent and then put on grill or pan. Cover and cook for about 6 to 8 minutes per side or to desired temperature. Brush patties with cannabis butter to make more tasty and juicy.</li>
</ul>
[/one_half_last]
<hr>
[one_half]
<h3>PESTO MAYO INGREDIENTS:</h3>
¼-½ cup pesto
¼ cup cannabis olive oil 
1 ¼ -½ cup whole fat mayonnaise
pinch of salt and ground pepper
[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>PESTO MAYO DIRECTIONS: </h3>
	<ul>
<li>Mix, taste, and use to coat both sides of potato bun.   </li>
</ul>
[/one_half_last]
<hr>
[one_half]
<h3>PEPPER NECTARINE MIX INGREDIENTS</h3>
1 red pepper, sliced like sticks
1 green pepper, sliced like sticks
1 small red onion, chopped
1 jalapeño pepper, sliced long way
1 Tablespoon chopped garlic
1 cup sliced button mushrooms 
2 nectarines, sliced thinly but not too thin so they don’t disintegrate
6-8 pieces of bacon, chopped and added to mix
2–4 Tablespoons of cannabis olive oil (to keep pan or griddle moist so vegetables don’t stick but not so much that you are saturating – use extra olive oil or cannabis olive oil as needed)
1-2 Tablespoons cannabis butter for taste
½ teaspoon Kosher salt 
½ teaspoon ground fresh pepper 
2-3 Tablespoons brown sugar
[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>PEPPER NECTARINE MIX  DIRECTIONS: </h3>
	<ul>
<li>Heat griddle or pan until very hot; add oil, butter and put all hard vegetables in first, toss around and sauté, adding mushrooms and nectarines last. Season as desired per taste and keep moving in the pan or griddle to cook evenly and thoroughly. Don’t overcook, the goal is to keep vegetables firm and crispy. Once cooked, remove from heat and set aside for burger assembly.</li>
</ul>
[/one_half_last]

<h3 class="page-header">BURGER ASSEMBLY</H3>
<p>Brush potato buns with cannabis butter on top and inside, and toast until slightly browned. Brush liberally with Pesto Mayo on both sides of bun. Place burger patty down first. Add a generous amount of the Pepper Nectarine Mix to burger and spoon on more Pesto Mayo – I love it so much I practically bathe in the stuff. Cover with top bun and enjoy! </p>

<h2>OHIO</h2>
Approximately three out of four Ohio voters support amending the state constitution to make medical cannabis legal for patients with terminal or debilitating conditions, according to Public Policy Polling which conducted the February 17-18 poll. The survey found 74% of voters in favor and only 22% opposed with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8%. Ohioans for Medical Marijuana (OMM), a committee that has been formed to support the forthcoming initiative, will need to collect at least 305,591 valid signatures of Ohio voters by early July to qualify the measure for the November ballot.

<h2>MONTANA</h2>
In February, the Montana Supreme Court reached a ruling that clamped down on commercial sales of cannabis by limiting providers to no more than three patients each. The court's decision upheld other provisions of a 2011 state law that represents one of the most significant rollbacks attempted by states that have legalized cannabis for medical purposes. The law, meant to curb abuses that led to a flourishing cannabis industry in Montana five years ago, would have banned medical cannabis providers from receiving any compensation. The court said the sales ban would leave some patients with debilitating illnesses with no available source for the drug. However, the court upheld the requirement that marijuana providers can take on a maximum of three patients each. The justices also upheld provisions of the law that ban medical marijuana advertising and create an automatic review for doctors who recommend the drug for more than 25 patients.

<h2>OKLAHOMA</h2>
Two marijuana policy bills passed the Oklahoma House in March, and will now move on to the Senate. HB 2479 would reduce Oklahoma’s penalties for marijuana possession from two years to one year, in turn, cutting the mandatory minimum sentence for a second or subsequent marijuana possession conviction within 10 years of the first. It would also reduce the maximum sentence for such a conviction from 10 years to five years. HB 2835 would add people with certain medical conditions to the list of patients given limited protections for possession of CBD oil. Although the bill still limits such oil to 0.3% THC and fails to provide in-state access, it is an acknowledgement by the legislature that cannabis can help patients with varying medical conditions.

<h2>PENNYSLVANIA</h2>
The Pennsylvania House of Representatives approved comprehensive medical cannabis legislation in late March. SB 3 will now return to the Senate, which approved the bill last May, to consider the House’s amendments. Gov. Tom Wolf has been a strong champion of the issue and will sign the legislation when it arrives at his desk. SB 3 allows patients with qualifying conditions to use and safely access medical cannabis with their physicians’ recommendations. As amended by the House, it allows up to 25 growers to produce medical cannabis, which would be dispensed by up to 50 dispensaries with up to three locations each.

<h2>VIRGINIA</h2>
Virginia lawmakers considered many cannabis-related bills this year, but only one — SB 701 — made it to the desk of Governor Terry McAuliffe. This limited bill allows the cultivation of cannabis for purposes of making cannabidiol (CBD) oil. Patients suffering from intractable epilepsy could receive the oil with a written certification from their doctor. While Gov. McAuliffe is expected to sign the legislation, epileptic patients won’t receive any benefit until at least 2017, as the bill requires a second passage next year.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dr. Michele Ross founded the IMPACT (Improving Marijuana Policy & Accelerating Cannabinoid Therapeutics) Network, a Denver-based nonprofit dedicated to advancing clinical cannabis research and educating patients, healthcare professionals and policymakers about the medical benefits of cannabis. Armed with a Ph.D. in neuroscience from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dr. Ross is also the author of “Vitamin Weed: a 4-Step Plan to Prevent and Reverse Endocannabinoid Deficiency,” which teaches people how to boost their endocannabinoid system naturally with dietary phytocannabinoids.

In what capacity did you first get involved with cannabis?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">

I first started learning about cannabis as a graduate student working on my neuroscience Ph.D. at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. So I started to learn about cannabis and the endocannabinoid system through my studies in pharmacology but there really wasn’t too much on it. I was a NIDA (National Institute of Drug Abuse) funded researcher. NIDA sponsored my lab and our research which was the study of the harmful effects of drugs of abuse on the brain. These drugs included cocaine, meth, Adderall, and anti-depressants. We also studied cannabinoids like THC, and de-synthetic cannabinoids. One of the things we did was look at all the research at the time, which was in 2006. We wanted to figure out what cannabinoids do to the brain assuming that they cause harm due to them being a Schedule 1 drug. We actually reviewed the literature and, based on our own findings, we actually found that cannabis and cannabinoids actually grew brain cells, which was a little controversial back in the day. That was the very first paper I published. It was interesting to step back and know that this was contrary to everything I had learned. I started to dig a little deeper and to try and understand what an endocannabinoid system was and finding out it’s basically on every neuron.

Did you try cannabis prior to studying it?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I was actually really reluctant to ever try cannabis. One reason being I was a Ph.D. student in Dallas, Texas, which is an illegal state and so cannabis is not easy to come by. Due to the nature of my work, if anyone ever found me smoking a joint, I could lose my job permanently and never be able to do drug research again. Based on the contextual environment there, I never went down that path.
But when I moved to California and started doing research at Cal-Tech it was a different environment. Personally I was still reluctant to do it there because I have a family history of mental illness – bipolar and schizophrenia runs in my family. Cannabis doesn’t cause schizophrenia but it can bump up the initiation or onset by a couple of years if you have the genetics for it. So I waited until after that window when mental illness kicks in to try it in my late 20s. But I was still scared, it’s a little bit of a roll of a dice when you have that genetic and family background. (Editor’s Note: Ross decided to use cannabis as a result of a medical issue that presented in her late 20s.)
I had a really weird type of palsy in my hand. I woke up overnight and my hand just stopped working. It was cramped and painful and it didn’t go back to normal for three months. And they were trying to put me on all these drugs but nothing was really helping. I went through all the pharmaceutical options first. I tried everything. I was facing a $25,000 surgery, they were going to cut nerves in my neck and arm and they weren’t even really sure it would work.
Rather than have a surgery where they were going to cut on my nerves and really having no reason for this happening in the first place, I turned to alternative medicine. I tried vitamins, herbal medicine, acupuncture, I even tried electro-acupuncture to try to wake up my nerves. Than it turned out that using a regimen of cannabis and massage woke up my nerves. Even to this day, if I stop taking the cannabis for a month, my arm is pretty much useless. I have now been diagnosed with neuropathy and fibromyalgia.

Why did you decide to write “Vitamin Weed”?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

When I would talk to doctors it was appalling how little they knew about CBD and THC, even here in Colorado. You talk to
doctors and 99 percent of them don’t even know what a CBD is and you have to tell them it’s that thing that helps
seizures, and I would ask them: Haven’t you watched CNN’s “Weed”? They don’t know anything. I had actually written a
previous book, “Train Your Brain to Get Thin: Prime Your Gray Cells for Weight Loss, Wellness, and Exercise,” which was
published in 2012 and was basically a manual using neuroscience to teach people about how to overcome cravings, to sort
of create this lifestyle shift to ensure weight loss, and a healthy lifestyle would be maintained and you wouldn’t be in
a yo-yo diet situation. So applying that same sort of reasoning to cannabis, I noticed that a lot of patients,
especially out in California, thought you could smoke a joint and be cured of cancer or smoke a joint and their diabetes
would be gone. People didn’t really understand that sometimes when you are really sick, it takes a lot of holistic
healing and a complete lifestyle change to go from totally chronically ill to well.

What causes our endocannabinoid systems to become compromised?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Cannabis has many beneficial properties, but if you are really sick and you have a bad diet and you are stressed out all the time and you are taking medications that harm your endocannabinoid system, there’s really no way you can actually benefit from cannabis. We have seen non-responders who take cannabis oil and it doesn’t do anything for them. The endocannabinoid system is set up to initiate self-healing. I really equate it to people whose endocannabinoid systems are so broken they couldn’t be receptive to cannabis. Some people are just really, really unhealthy and their fat cells are so unhealthy that when they try to burn fat, exercise or diet their fat cells can‘t even shuttle the fat out of their system for them to lose weight. There are people who are just so unhealthy that they will go exercise and the fat gets stuck and just goes back in the fat cells and makes them more hungry. So, in this way, it really enables and is empowering healthcare providers and patients to really understand their bodies and how their endocannabinoid system works and understand there has to be a commitment to change. It’s just like any other lifestyle change, when people commit more and give more time to understand how to lose weight and understand how to use cannabis and come off pharmaceutical drugs it will be more successful. People think you just take this oil and everything will be okay. It’s just not like that. There was no real how-to guide that guides both the patient and the healthcare provider and holds their hands and walks them through it.

Why do you think medical schools don’t study the endocannabinoid system?

When you look at other things that they do teach in medical schools, it seems like the systems they can prescribe drugs on are the ones that they cover. So they cover the dopamine system, they cover the serotonin system because there are drug targets for that and you can prescribe drugs for that. Up until this point, the only drug you could prescribe for the endocannabinoid system was Marinol and that was only used for oncology patients. If there were no pharmaceuticals you could prescribe for, it wasn’t really involved in the conversation because it’s a Schedule 1 drug. If you look at LSD, do we talk about LSD in medical school? No, it’s on the list of things you are supposed to tell patients to avoid cause they are harmful drugs. We don’t cover Ecstasy or have lectures on cocaine, and it’s a lower schedule than marijuana. So really when the conversation is about cannabis it’s just as a drug to avoid, we don’t talk about the endocannabinoid system even though it regulates every other neurotransmitter in the body. 
It’s very confusing from that standpoint and it’s much harder to add curriculum to medical schools than it is to offer continuing medical education. If you look at the fact that the endocannabinoid system is really missing from the curriculum, you also realize there are a lot of other things missing from the medical school curriculum, for example, nutrition. We know now that a lot of different diseases can be caused by vitamin deficiency. For instance, Vitamin D deficiency, 90 percent of us are Vitamin D deficient and it can cause a whole long list of problems, including cancer. So you would think we need to tell doctors to test for Vitamin D levels and have that be a part of medical school curriculum. But we don’t. We don’t talk about vitamins or nutrition. If it’s not based in pharmaceutical medications, we don’t talk about it. So the omission of the endocannabinoid system isn’t the only glaring thing missing from medical school curriculum. I just think MD curriculum is really outdated and not serving patients. It’s also not serving the doctors because they could be armed with better tools to diagnose and treat their patients.

When do you think they will start to implement that curriculum?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Considering the fact that doctors still can’t even recommend cannabis to their patients without being in violation of federal law and it being Schedule 1 and them possibly even losing their malpractice insurance, I think until it gets rescheduled, there’s really not going to be a push to put it in the curriculum. What’s the incentive for a medical school to add that? They already have a limited amount of time to cover things. Everyone is just left to this weird self-education role which is not really ideal whatsoever. You also don’t have that many endocannabinoid experts in this country to help them develop curriculum or to help teach at each of these schools. It’s been such a taboo field for so long that there just aren’t people who have committed their entire careers to studying it in each of these states. So it’s really a hard process to try to institute into the curriculum across the nation. We have been trying to talk to universities about implementing it but their whole thing is they have drug-free policies but endocannabinoid systems are not a drug, it’s a neurotransmitter system. But you still get that same tone from them ‘that the only reason we would need to know about it is because it’s a drug.’ But, no, it actually regulates all of the other systems. 
I actually have talked to a lot of doctors who run the old-guard organizations and societies and they have said nothing is basically going to change until old-school doctors and physicians running these medical schools and healthcare organizations die. They are not going to change their view that cannabis is a harmful drug and that we shouldn’t be enabling doctors to learn about it so they can go make their patients drug addicts. But ironically it’s okay for doctors to push opiates. It doesn’t make any sense and it is terribly frustrating as an intelligent person and a researcher to see all this. They also have to deal with backlash from donors. You have very conservative donors, donating millions to these universities they are afraid if they start changing curriculum it will make the news that they are teaching about the endocannabinoid system. So it becomes this political game instead of education or what it should be about.

What do you think will happen with regard to the recent news that the DEA is considering rescheduling cannabis this summer?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

At first I was hopeful. Because this week (April 19-21, 2016) at the United Nations they are having a meeting called UNGASS, which is a special session of the United Nations General Assembly on the world drug problem, and international leaders were supposed to set a new policy for dealing with different drugs of abuse and the international treaty that keeps cannabis, for example, as a Schedule 1 drug. There was some talk that cannabis may be taken off that Schedule 1 list or dropped down a notch or two. It turns out the powers-that-be are not going to do that, and the DEA seems to follow whatever the international treaty is. So basically what they were saying is it doesn’t matter what Americans want or international leaders want, if the international treaty says that cannabis is a Schedule 1 drug, they are not going to change our American policy because they have to comply with the international treaty. So if it doesn’t change, we will find out very soon what the official announcement is, but word on the street is that nothing is changing about cannabis. It’s unfortunate, but I do see that happening.
Even when the rest of the world adopts something, we don’t always fall in line, we are usually the last country to do it. Not only are we not early adopters, we are not adopters at all. We are non-conformists, we are like: Let’s not pay women, we are still on the English system as opposed to the metric system. If the whole world adopted these changes, or legalized cannabis, I am pretty sure the U.S. would be like we’re not going to do it. It’s very frustrating because top policymakers are saying this is going to make sense, but it just takes one or two people at the top to say ‘no.’ The DEA has been presented evidence over and over again by top experts about cannabis’ medical benefits. Even judges presiding over some of these hearings believe there is enough evidence to realize there are medical benefits and it should be a Schedule 1 drug. But then again, the DEA doesn’t have to listen to the hearings or the judge, the DEA is like its own power unless a President changes it, or the Senate and the House changes it.

What has been your most fascinating cannabis discovery to date? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Cannabis surprises me every day. I think it’s the power of the raw cannabinoids which we are just learning about that has surprised me most. I think my favorite fact is that the raw version of CBD or cannabidiol is called CBD-A and that cannabinoid actually works as a COX-2 inhibitor. COX-2 is an enzyme that causes inflammation and pain so if you inhibit it, you inhibit pain and inflammation when you actually have prescription drugs on the market that work as COX-2 inhibitors like Celebrex, etc. These drugs have actually been tested in clinical trials to both treat and prevent different types of cancer, like colon and breast cancer, so the possibility that this raw cannabinoid CBD-A can actually treat and prevent cancer is amazing. I just find it so empowering that in the future we are going to be to able to prevent cancer in people who we know are at high risk for it with some of these cannabinoids. CBD-A and CGA are just two raw cannabinoids that we know of but there’s a whole bunch of them. I think there is so much promise for each of them. Every time we learn of a new cannabinoid, we find out this one works for bone healing, this one helps with menopause – it’s just like being a kid in a candy store. To me it’s fascinating, we have never had a class of drugs before that almost every single one has not only one, but multiple medicinal benefits. I feel like we could be researching the benefits of these cannabinoids for decades and still not even know everything about them.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Repeating already busted cannabis’ myths is a temptation that we must avoid at all costs. The myth that cannabis use at early age is associated with schizophrenia in genetic-prone individuals, as you implied, has been debunked. 


A genome-wide association study (1) conclude: "These results are the first, to our knowledge, to identify specific CAD risk alleles and potential genetic factors contributing to the comorbidity of CAD with major depression and schizophrenia." 

In the words of one of the authors, Joel Gelernter, MD: "So we thought we will see overlap with schizophrenia, because there's prior epidemiology that suggest early cannabis use is associated with later onset of schizophrenia. There's some overlap between the symptoms experienced by people who are intoxicated with cannabis and people that had schizophrenia. So that was our hypothesis. But we didn't find overlap with schizophrenia. With genome wide pleiotropy analysis we found, to our surprise, it was instead overlap with major depression." (2)


So, genetic prone individuals may develop depression and other Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency related conditions or syndromes. Those same individuals, are treated as addicts and quantified by NIDA as marijuana addicts or as they call it... "psychological cannabis dependence." 


I'm sure it's a crime to discriminate against insulin-dependent patients, and that's no different from discriminating against cannabis seeking individuals that may have CECD. Supplementation with non-intoxicating cannabinoids at an early age may serve to decrease early adolescent ilegal cannabis use incidence. Also education to adolescents regarding the ECS and the implications of new research data on cannabis may serve to clear all that "Post-Reefer Madness Propaganda” smoke!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Education is key in the world of cannabis. Yet, as essential as it is, it’s one of the trickiest issues patients will encounter -- a lack of physicians with the cannabis expertise to offer knowledge, education and healing. But take heart, Nevada is fortunate enough to have a few working in different roles in the medical cannabis industry who are a great resource for those patients in search of guidance. They not only share an expertise of cannabis, but also an open-minded compassion for healing and understanding “first, do no harm” in the truest sense.
</p>

<h3 class="page-header">THE HEALER – DR. SEAN DEVLIN <br><span style="font-size:15px;">by Beth Schwartz</span></h3>
<p>Meet the unicorn of medical cannabis in Nevada – Dr. Sean Devlin of Reno-based Washoe Wellness. The board-certified family physician is somewhat of a rarified creature in the world of cannabis care. Not only is he supremely educated with board certifications and fellowships in Anti-Aging and Regenerative medicine, a master’s degree in Biochemistry and doctoral studies in Pharmacology, but he has been treating patients with cannabis since Nevada voters legalized it in 2000. </p>
<p>“Back then it was very primitive, it was like if you’re going to smoke it, vaporize it or consume it through inhaling, then you basically had to take metered doses of it via inhaling, so you would have one hit, wait five or 10 minutes, and see if you were having an effect and then take a second one,” explains Dr. Devlin. “Of course, now the world has changed and we have almost pharmaceutical-grade cannabis and, in many cases, are actually able to give milligram dose recommendations to patients for whatever is ailing them along with combinations of different cannabinoids and, ultimately, we are going to recommend a hybrid versus sativa versus indica. We can kind of sculpt a patient’s therapy around different symptoms and what they are looking for as far as either relief or treatment goes. It’s a lot better now than it was 15 or 16 years ago.”</p>
<p>Dr. Devlin was in the second year of his residency at University of Nevada, Reno when voters passed Question 9, amending the state constitution to sanction medical cannabis. Patients would ask him about it and he “would write recommendations because I had researched it, was familiar with it, and believed in it,” he explains. “Specifically under Nevada statutes, the law allows for licensed physicians to make a recommendation in good faith after they complete a full history and physical, and have counseled the patients about the good, the bad and the ugly associated with using cannabis.” </p>
<p>Both an owner and lead physician at Washoe Wellness, Dr. Devlin became “known in Northern Nevada as somebody who is not only competent, well researched and credentialed, but somebody who is open to recommending cannabis for patients with cancer because I was primarily using it to treat cancer patients as an antineoplastic and the word got out and doctors in the area would refer patients to me,” he explains. “I have seen a multitude of benefits from this one agent that I have not seen in any agent before. You have anti-nausea effects, a pro appetite effect, a bone stimulating effect, an immune modulating effect,  antineoplastic effect, an antianxiety effect, an antispasmodic effect, it’s also anti-inflammatory -- and for cancer patients with advanced stages of disease it’s a no-brainer. Globally they need to be on a combination of cannabinoids: CBD, THC, THC-A.”</p>
<p>In addition to treating patients with advanced stage cancers who have run out of options, Dr. Devlin’s other specialties are pain management and Lyme disease. “Yesterday I saw five patients and all except one had Stage 4 cancer and the last one had a severe seizure disorder,” he notes. “These folks are not dreadlocked 21-year-olds who are traveling with the Rainbow Troop. These are legitimate patients and I think the public doesn’t really understand that. They get a view of this as basically being this hippy-dippy, drum circle kind of collective and that medical marijuana is what they do, and that’s a great falsehood that’s been foisted on the public through the media.”</p>
<p>Doing his part to correct that falsehood, Dr. Devlin and his partners decided to bring a game-changer to the world of cannabis, creating “a very strong academic, scientifically-based program which would support a cultivation company, an extracts company, a dispensary, and eventually a clinic -- and all of those things fell into line over the last two-and-a-half years,” he explains of Tahoe Regional Botanicals, Tahoe Regional Extracts, Canopy Reno, and Washoe Wellness.</p>
<p>Naturally, Washoe Wellness, which opened earlier this year, is the only one of its kind in Nevada -- just like the state’s other unicorn in the cannabis care space. </p>

<h3 class="page-header">THE RESEARCHER – DR. NICK SPIRTOS <br><span style="font-size:15px;">by Lissa Townsend Rodgers</span></h3>
<p>The Apothecary Shoppe is a bit different than other Las Vegas dispensaries. First, there’s the look of the place: Rather than the standard white box or spa waiting room, it looks like an old-time library or doctor’s office. But what really sets it apart is the team behind the glass cases (and what’s in them).</p>
<p>“A group of five of us docs said, ‘Let’s do this,’” explains Dr. Nick Spirtos, one of the doctors who created the Apothecary Shoppe. “We have three GYNs, an internist/pulmonologist, and an anesthesiologist. It’s a diverse group of doctors that’s used to taking care of patients with pain and other debilitating issues.”</p>
<p> In his fourth decade practicing medicine, Spirtos’ specialty is gynecologic oncology—a field whose complexity appealed to him. “The world of cancer was always going to be evolving,” he says. “There was never going to be the issue of boredom. Then there was the surgical aspect: My dad was a surgeon, I loved going to the E.R. But the oncological aspect and the challenge of moving the needle in that field—the genetics, the computer world has changed our ability to look at individual genes now. There’s always something going on.”</p>
<p>Dr. Spirtos’ enthusiasm for new methods of treating patients includes cannabis. “I grew up in Southern California during the ‘60s,” he laughs, “So although I never used any stuff like that, I certainly had an awareness of it.”</p>
<p>That awareness and openness served his patients well later: “You watch enough patients who abandon their treatment because of side effects—you start looking for other answers for them,” he says, “It was clear, anecdotally, that patients who could not have their symptoms relieved by standard available medications were responding to cannabis in a variety of forms.”</p>
<p> To that end, the Apothecary Shoppe is conducting a series of medical trials to study the effects of cannabis on chemotherapy patients. “It’s placebo-controlled—half the patients get a syrup with no THC or CBD. The other half will get the medicated syrup,” Spirtos explains, “After they’re treated, we compare it to their baseline, their first cycle of chemotherapy and their responses, their nausea and vomiting based on that first cycle.”</p>
<p>The ability to conduct these studies and others like them was a motivating factor in opening the Apothecary Shoppe. The doctors involved see the dispensary less as a way to make money than as a way to make change in patients’ lives, not only through dispensing medicine, but through researching it. Spirtos explains, “We wanted to know that if we wanted our studies done, that would be a priority. If we had to choose between using oil in a syrup for our studies versus oil in a vape pen to sell—those are some of the choices you make.”</p>
<p>Spirtos says the study will take a year to complete, but the timeframe also depends on how fast patients can get their medical marijuana cards—a problem many Nevada cardholders are familiar with—which are required to participate in the study.</p>
<p>While Spirtos appreciates the Silver State’s rigorous licensing as compared to California’s laissez-faire attitude—“the state has tried very hard to do this properly, they want it regulated, they want the quality”—he notes that such thoroughness carries problems. “Imagine you see a patient who’s vomiting their guts out, who can’t handle their chemotherapy. But you can’t get them a Nevada card for eight weeks, 10 weeks, 12 weeks. That’s three-quarters of the way through their chemotherapy.”</p>
<p> Even though the study is still underway, patients undergoing chemotherapy can get access to the syrup he is testing now as the Apothecary Shoppe sells it under the name Soothing Remedies medicated syrup.</p>
<p>Despite the delays, Dr. Spirtos is still happy to see patients who need medicine finally getting it—and other doctors increasingly willing to give it to them. “There's a generalized acceptance that there's a benefit,” he says. And Dr. Nick Spirtos and the Apothecary Shoppe will continue researching—and offering—those benefits for as long as patients need them. </p>

<h3 class="page-header">THE EDUCATOR – DR. WILLIAM TROUTT<br><span style="font-size:15px;">By Beth Schwartz</span></h3>
<p>“Cannabis is not a one-size-fits-all medicine,” explains Dr. William Troutt, a licensed Naturopathic physician who specializes in cannabis-based medicine. “It’s very individualized to the patient who is using it.”</p>
<p>That’s why he believes dosing is one of the most important things a patient needs to understand when using cannabis. “How they start dosing is very important, especially as far as the experience they are going to get from it. We educate patients on conservative dosing or safe dosing strategies,” says Dr. Troutt, who is the Director of Medical Education for Las Vegas dispensary, The+Source.</p>
<p>“However,” he cautions, “we are not their treating physician so we can’t tell them what to specifically take. But, we can educate them on strategies they can use to most conservatively find the best dose that works for them.” </p>
<p>Another tenet Dr. Troutt espouses during the new patient orientation he teaches at The+Source each month is that cannabis’ psychoactive effect is not for everybody. “There are some people who just do not do well with it. People who have never used cannabis before typically are a lot more affected by that psychoactive effect than someone who is a regular user of it. So we educate them on THC and how they can use that as an indicator of the psychoactive potency of the medicine and understand which medicines may have more THC.”</p>
<p>Dr. Troutt, who also provides medical direction for five dispensaries in Arizona, has been educating patients on dosing and offering guidance on cannabis since 2010 when the Medical Marijuana Act passed in Arizona. “For the last six years, I have been exclusively working with cannabis patients and dispensaries, which allowed many of the patients and the physicians to come out of the closet.</p>
<p>“When I first started practicing medicine in 2004, I had many patients who were using cannabis medically but they just couldn’t talk about it then, obviously, because of the politics of it and the law. But as a naturopath who was open to that, they would share that with me and I would take that into consideration for their full treatment plan,” says Dr. Troutt, who is a member of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians. </p>
<p>And that is one of the major challenges with regard to patient education, according to Dr. Troutt. “I hate to say it, but that is still taking place now -- patients don’t want to talk to their primary care physicians or the specialists they are seeing about their medical cannabis use because they are afraid they are either going to get kicked out of their practice or the physician is going to have biases against them. That is still the biggest problem we are facing -- patients are scared to have that dialogue.”</p>
<p>Although patients might not feel comfortable talking to their primary care physicians, they can feel at ease speaking with Dr. Troutt in his role at The+Source. He notes that, “The+Source really does care about this being a medical program and putting patients first and absolutely provides great educational resources so the patients can get the best benefit out of this medicine.”</p>

[one_half]
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
70 grams of gelatin
140 grams of water
225 grams of sugar
245 grams of corn syrup
15 grams of citric acid
1 dram of flavor 
6-10 drops of food color
three 6 oz. boxes of Nerd candy 
1.5 grams of canna oil 
*cornstarch as needed

[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>NECESSARY EQUIPMENT: </h3>
2 small pots/saucepans 
2 candy thermometers 
spoons 
two 7" x 11" baking trays
parchment paper 
knife
*cornstarch as needed over molds
[/one_half_last]

[one_half]
<h3>PART 1: GELATIN SOLVENT</h3>
<p>
In separate pot, make a water bath with a candy thermometer keeping temperature around 150°F. Pour 70 grams of gelatin and 140 grams of water into a ziplock bag. Mix thoroughly, removing clumps and streaks. Cook in water bath for 20-30 minutes until clear.
</p>
[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>PART 2: SUGAR SOLVENT</h3>
<p>Mix 225 grams of sugar and 245 grams of corn syrup well, when sugar has dissolved (around 10 minutes) add oil to the pot. Mix well! Continue cooking for 20 minutes.
</p>
[/one_half_last]

<h3 class="page-header">PART 3: COMBINE</H3>
<p>-Combine parts 1 and 2. Add *food color, citric acid, and flavor of choice. 
*Add 6-10 drops for a good hue. Mix well!
-Let the mixture set awhile, approximately 25-30 minutes, until it thickens, viscous (pourable, not watery).
-Place parchment paper on baking tray, covering all sides. Coat the parchment lightly with cornstarch. Pour the mixture onto tray or, if you are comfortable with the viscous consistency of your mixture, you may pour the mixture right on to the parchment allowing it to pool, but it shouldn’t be too much of a liquid consistency so as not to stay on sheet. 
-Let mixture set 5-10 minutes on parchment.
-Grab the other baking tray. Place the parchment paper covering the bottom of the baking tray. Fill tray with Nerds. Take your "slab" of gummy mixture and slice into desired sized ropes.
-Roll the ropes in your pool of Nerds and get ready to enjoy.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-size:15px;">By Julie Vigil</p>

<p>Cultivated from seed over the course of the past year, Nevada’s medical cannabis market has slowly matured and blossomed. Medical dispensaries, cultivation and production facilities are branching out across the state and the variety of cannabis-infused products is just starting to come to fruition.</p>
<p>Patients looking for an all-natural path to help alleviate garden-variety symptoms like pain and inflammation, nausea, stress, anxiety, skin conditions, or even mobility need not dig deeper than the newest line of medibles, holistic cannabinoids, and plant-based nutritional supplements taking root on local dispensary shelves.
</p>

<h3 class="page-header">CHEW LIKE A WEED</h3>
<p>Deep Roots Harvest, a cultivation and production facility located in Mesquite, is now Nevada’s exclusive distributor for the popular Cheeba Chews, a medical-grade cannabis-infused candy known as “America’s favorite edible,” according to 
High Times.
</p>
<p>A three-time Cannabis Cup winner, Cheeba Chews ensures medical cannabis consumers a potent, consistent, and discreet product. The company tests its cannabis oil during multiple stages — from growing through processing — to ensure a consistent experience with every chew.</p>
<p>Ryan Breeden, Deep Roots’ chief operating officer, says his company will offer several types of the medible and anticipates Cheeba Chews to be on medical dispensary shelves across the state this month.</p>
<p>“We’re going to start with an indica, a sativa, and a hybrid Cheeba Chew,” Breeden said. A high-CBD Cheeba Chew will also be available. “We’re really excited to carry them because we believe it’s going to provide patients consistency in their dosages.”</p>
<p>The chews have been compared to Tootsie Rolls but unlike the classic candy, Cheeba Chews are infused with cannabis and other all-natural ingredients. They’re a gluten- and peanut-free product too, and can be easily portioned to suit patients’ individual needs.</p>
<p>“I think that’s appealing to people, to be able to medicate and not have a full stomach,” Breeden added.</p>

<h3 class="page-header">GARDEN OF WEEDIN</h3>
<p>Dixie Elixirs, another big name in the medibles market, is breaking ground in Nevada thanks to a joint venture agreement with locally-based Silver State Wellness. The well-known brand’s line of elixirs, chocolates, Synergy edibles, and mints should be in all Nevada dispensaries by the end of the summer, once the local manufacturing facility has finished its build-out.</p>
<p>“We’re taking our tried-and-true and tested formulations and product development and putting that into the 
Nevada market,” said Joe Hodas, Dixie Brands’ chief marketing officer, “so you’re getting the benefit of the last 
six years of development experience we’ve had in perfecting these products.
</p>
<p>“Part of our standard operating procedure is when we partner with someone they have to triple lab test everything so that we can assure dosing, quality, and consistency of the product.”</p>
<p>Late last year, Dixie Brands introduced two new products to its hemp wellness lines: Aceso, designed to provide general wellness and relief from minor aches, pains, and mild anxiety, and Therabis. Therabis, while similar to Aceso, is actually designed for pets to relieve itchy skin, mild anxieties, and joint mobility. Both product lines utilize a holistic cannabinoid blend in the form of a daily 7.5mg CBD powder sachet packet or a 5mg CBD spray.</p>
<p>The Aceso line, named after the Greek goddess of healing, comes in Calm, Soothe, and Wellness formulas. And for pets, the Therabis line offers Stop the Itch, Up and Moving, and Calm and Quiet.</p>
<p>“What’s really unique about Aceso — and Therabis, although they’re obviously designed for different audiences — is that the products not only have cannabinoids like CBD but they also have other natural ingredients that attenuate the effect so that it has an ‘entourage effect,’ ” Hodas said. “For example, with Aceso’s Calm formulation we have the cannabinoids plus terpenes known for their anti-anxiety effects, such as limonene and linalool from grapefruit and lavender, and passionflower extract that provides anxiety-reducing benefits.”</p>
<p>Aceso is currently available for purchase online at myaceso.com or at Las Vegas dispensaries ReLeaf and Oasis. 
Therabis is available for purchase at therabis.com, and at Sierra Wellness dispensary in Reno and ReLeaf in Las Vegas.
</p>
<h3 class="page-header">BREAKING NEW GROUND</h3>
<p>There is an over-the-counter and prescription non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) epidemic tearing through the United States, debilitating and even killing tens of thousands of people of all ages and backgrounds every year.</p>
<p>Fueled by physicians’ desires to treat America’s chronic pain problems, and with an aggressive marketing push from pharmaceutical companies, doctors wrote 259 million prescriptions for opioid painkillers in 2012 alone — that’s enough to give a bottle of pills to every adult in the country.</p>
<p>Too often people are unaware of the very dangerous and very real side effects that come with frequent and long-term use of NSAIDs, such as blood clots, strokes, kidney failure, high blood pressure, heart attacks, and intestinal bleeding.</p>
<p>Armed with this knowledge, educated patients who seek a safer and all-natural alternative to aiding their body’s own response to musculoskeletal inflammation now have two new holistic dietary supplements to turn to, Preleve and HempChoice Preleve.</p>
<p>"We built the Preleve brand to be an advocate for both patients and licensed medical providers,” said Dr. Scott Martin, CEO and founder of Preleve Therapeutics. “We have focused our efforts on handcrafting more pure, and more holistic alternatives to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and narcotics."</p>
<p>To augment the body’s natural response to inflammation, targeted botanicals like Chinese skullcap, curcumine (turmeric), ginger, boswellia extract, and undenatured collagen are used in Preleve products, which are 100 percent natural, GMO-free, and soy-free, and are taken via a plant-based capsule.</p>
<p>HempChoice Preleve has the same five nutraceuticals as Preleve, plus the added benefit of phytocannabinoid-rich (PCR) hemp oil. HempChoice, a highly concentrated PCR hemp oil, increases the bioavailability of phytocannabinoids, meaning the body can absorb it easily.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to provide dietary supplements patients and licensed medical providers can rely upon,” Dr. Martin said, noting Preleve is currently available through licensed healthcare providers while HempChoice Preleve will be available this summer through medicinal dispensaries only.</p>
<p>“Our Preleve brand was expertly developed and is meticulously manufactured to help promote the body’s natural response to inflammatory musculoskeletal stress,” explained Dr. Martin. “We invested heavily to provide our clients products that maximize bioavailability and minimize psychoactive effects." </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>CANNABIS TOUR  DE FORCE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>"Honestly, I was ignorant and misinformed before taking this tour,” Henderson patient Jada Webb explains of Las Vegas Medical Marijuana Association’s (LVMMA) Industry Focus Tour. When Webb took the tour this past February, she was a new medical cannabis patient cardholder—and extremely unsure of her decision.</p>
<p>So Webb, who asked that her real name not be used, decided to find out firsthand about Nevada’s medical cannabis industry by taking the trade association’s tour alongside other patients, business professionals, and LVMMA President John Laub, who directed the tour. </p>
<p>A typical Industry Focus Tour, which LVMMA debuted in December 2015, allows patients to explore three dispensaries and either a lab or cultivation with the aim of showcasing what is going on in Nevada’s cannabis space.</p>
<p>LVMMA President John Laub notes that other states like Colorado, where cannabis is also legal, offer tours. LVMMA decided to follow suit and started the tours as a way for the business community and patients to see the dispensaries, labs and cultivation facilities as well as bring attention to Southern Nevada’s newest industry. </p>
<p>“We want the community to see how serious the industry is about its mission to serve patients,” Laub explains. “We believe that we have the best looking dispensaries in the world and we are very proud of the testing that our labs perform. Las Vegas should be proud of what this industry has accomplished.” </p>
<p>The monthly tour, which costs $50 per person, falls on the last Friday of the month and usually fills up two buses, with nearly 60 patients and business professionals along for the ride. </p>
<p>Webb’s tour started at The Apothecary Shoppe, a dispensary located across from the Palms. Here, according to Webb, is when she began to realize that cannabis is anything but the stigma with which it is surrounded by. From meeting the owner of the dispensary to touring the newly remodeled facility with a resource book in hand, Webb says, “It was all just amazing. It went way beyond medicine.”</p>
<p>Next, Webb’s tour group visited MM Lab. Sectioned into smaller groups, she learned about Nevada’s stringent cannabis testing regulations from MM’s laboratory director. “That day wasn’t about buying medicine. Instead, I learned about what I was taking," remarks Webb.</p>
<p>Patient safety is a factor covered by all the facilities on each stop of the tour but MM Lab specifically caught Webb off guard. “There’s so many different things that cannabis is tested for…things I never thought to even look into as a patient,” she explains. “But it really made me feel better about using weed as medicine.”</p>
<p>The third stop on the Industry Focus Tour Webb took was NevadaPure, which is licensed as a dispensary as well as a cultivation/production facility. When Webb stepped into the cultivation room, she was surprised by its size. “NevadaPure was seriously massive. I mean it! It was nothing like I’ve ever seen before—like a department store for marijuana,” she explains of the facility’s 50,000-square-foot grow area. </p>
<p>The LVMMA tour group was met by NevadaPure’s owners, who schooled Webb on the detail-oriented and lengthy cultivation process. “The time it takes for weed to be grown legally and safely is incredible,” says Webb. “Seeing NevadaPure, I felt a wave of gratitude come over me. It sounds corny, but it’s really true.”</p>
<p>The final stop on Webb’s tour was to a third dispensary, Oasis Medical Cannabis Dispensary located on Industrial Road. Laub believes the dispensaries are a vital part of the tour. “It’s important that the dispensaries integrate with the community,” he explains. “Most people don’t know that they can visit a dispensary, they can go inside and sign in as a visitor to see what it is all about. Right now that outreach is extremely important as this industry ramps up.”</p>
<p>Webb seconds that. “I really had no idea what was going on at first, but I can say that I needed this to ease my doubt,” she concludes of her LVMMA Industry Focus Tour experience and decision to be patient cardholder. </p>
<p><em>LVMMA’s Industry Focus Tour takes place monthly and is open to everyone. Patients who are not yet cardholders are also welcome on the Industry Focus Tour, and will be allowed into most facilities with visitor passes. To take the June tour, register on LVMMA’s website, www.lvmma.org.</em> </p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="panel-body">
ToNevada Medical Marijuana (NMM) is not only committed to providing quality state-regulated and tested medical marijuana in flower, extracts, edible and infused products to valid medical marijuana patients, but also to educating new patients on how far the industry has come and the healing properties of cannabis as an alternative solution to pharmaceuticals, especially with the current opiate epidemic.

<h4>Patient Philosophy</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-body dissmall">

NMM strives to dispense a better quality of life for all of its patients, which the dispensary achieves by identifying the strains that best target the patient’s ailment and, in turn, recommending a patient-specific strain that has the most positive affect. NMM bud-tenders work with each patient to educate them on the methods of consumption and the effects of medical marijuana.

<h4>Staff Education</h4>
</div>
<div class="panel-body dissmall">

The staff at Nevada Medical Marijuana is trained by the dispensary’s general manager Chris DeGraff. “I take this very seriously,” explained DeGraff, who has been in the industry for over 5 years and managed dispensaries in Colorado. “I make sure all my employees are fully trained on every single product that comes through our doors. At the end of the day, we are dealing with medicine so we need to make sure our bud-tenders are highly trained.”

From the time they walk in the door to the time they leave, NMM’s patients are treated the same, relays DeGraff. “Our staff finds out how the patient likes to medicate, their experiences from the past and what works best for them. Medical marijuana affects every person differently so we find out what product works for them the best,” he explained.

Located in a professional medical complex, NMM is staffed by some of the most knowledgeable bud-tenders in the state, according to DeGraff. “The relationships our patients have with our bud-tenders are unique. If you have been here more than once, we know you by name,” he said. “Our dispensary is a place where anybody, young or old, can come and the bud-tenders selling it to them are very knowledgeable of our products."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You are a medical marijuana patient in Nevada. Your employer requests a drug test. Your first thought: Do I have to tell my employer about my patient status? And more importantly, can my employer fire me for using medical marijuana?</p>
<h3 class="page-header">Do I have to inform my employer?</h3>
<p>In Nevada, a patient is not required to inform their employer about their patient status. That information is confidential. However, if a patient wants to tell an employer, the patient can consult with an attorney to decide the most favorable way to do so.  </p>
<h3 class="page-header">Can my employer fire me for using medical marijuana? </h3>
<p>Nevada is one of the few states that attempt to minimize discrimination against medical marijuana patients. However, the law is still a little unclear for patients. A patient should first check the employer’s drug policy.</p>
<p>So what does that mean? Reasonable accommodations are changes that enable an individual to perform their duties, or let an employee enjoy equal benefits and privileges of the position. Some examples of reasonable accommodation include updating facilities, job restructuring, or acquiring new equipment.  
The amended statute also has some limitations. An employer can avoid reasonable accommodations if the changes: 
•	Pose a threat of harm or danger to persons or property or impose an undue hardship on the employer; or 
•	Prohibit the employee from fulfilling any and all of his or her job responsibilities. 
</p>
<h3 class="page-header">What poses a threat of harm or danger? </h3>
<p>Jobs that require the use of heavy machinery or operation of equipment that can be dangerous if used incorrectly may fall within this category. For example, if an employee has to drive a forklift on the side of a busy highway, the employer may prohibit marijuana use to ensure the safety of both the employee and the public. But keep in mind; since medical marijuana law is still under development, Nevada has yet to define this language.The courts will likely play a role in narrowing down the specifics.  </p>
<h3 class="page-header">What prohibits an employee from fulfilling a job responsibility?</h3>
<p>Lastly, an employer does not have to make reasonable accommodations if the changes would prohibit the employee from fulfilling any and all of his or her job responsibilities. Nevada does not define this language, so the application is a little unclear. But it can be inferred that a bus driver, who cannot drive while under the influence of marijuana, cannot fulfill his job responsibility and the employer is not forced to accommodate. As with the other exceptions, the details will probably be determined by future legislation and Nevada’s courts. </h3>
<h3 class="page-header">Are there any other exceptions or limitations?</h3>
<p>There may be other special circumstances that restrict the use of medical marijuana for certain jobs. Since marijuana is still federally illegal, federal government jobs can still be terminated based on marijuana usage. Additionally, jobs that involve public safety or transportation may have heightened restrictions.</p>
<p>Lastly, if a patient requires frequent use of medical marijuana, employers can still have restrictions on being under the influence during work hours or using on business property. </p>
<p>As always, the law will evolve as the industry grows. It is important to remember that Nevada is an “at-will” employment state which allows employees to be terminated without cause at any time. Therefore, it is difficult to tell an employee if they will be protected. Upcoming legislation and the court system will likely play a huge role in the future of patients’ rights and medical marijuana. </p>
<p>If you have any questions about medical marijuana law and rights in Nevada, you should contact an attorney familiar with medical marijuana laws.  </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Mitchell Britten, founder and CEO of two THRIVE Cannabis Marketplace dispensaries in Southern Nevada, as well as a North Las Vegas growing facility, worked in Colorado’s cannabis industry from 2009-2014, making him a virtual veteran in the industry. When Britten started his cannabis journey in 2009 for a Colorado company, it had a single store, a 5,000-square-foot grow, and a staff of 30 people. By the time Britten left the company in 2014, he was managing 13 stores, 550 employees, and $40 million a year in sales. With regard to his experience in the space, Elevate was curious to find out how the cannabis industries differed between Colorado and Nevada.

How did you first get involved in the cannabis industry? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">

It was a little bit of an accident, I was just finishing up school at Metro State University in Denver and I met somebody where I worked who owned a cannabis company and he recruited me to run one of his retail stores and the rest just kind of happened organically. I was studying Modern Philosophy and philosophy guys think outside of the box and this is definitely outside of the box. 
I am from a family of lawyers so I intended to go into law but the marijuana thing was just so hot and it was just beginning in Colorado, this was late 2008. I was a little uncertain as to whether I was going to do it or not but he was so persistent in trying to get me to come and work for him that I finally just bit the bullet and did it and it worked out. When I first started with the company we were a single store, a small grove of just over 5,000 square feet and the staff that goes along with that which is 25 or 30 people. By the time I left, we were 13 stores, 550 employees, a 3,600-flowering light grow and when I left the company I was Director of Operations. I kind of climbed all the way through the ranks and saw the business from its infancy to pretty much what it is now. That company represented $40 million a year in sales and about 35,000 lbs grown a year. It was serious business. 
It was my Ph.D. in marijuana. We did everything imaginable the wrong way; for me, learning from my mistakes is my biggest value-add. There are so many mistakes people repeatedly make in the industry. I always say I will make plenty of mistakes, I just won’t make the same ones again. From 2009 to 2013 in Colorado we made $20-million-plus dollars in mistakes -- whether it was improper design of HVAC system implementation in the cultivation facility or designing dispensaries, hiring or just methods or standard operating procedures -- that kind of give me a little bit of a leg up as far as my competition is concerned. My learning curve is just a little lower.

<div class="panel-body">

I was a retail store manager. I didn’t know anything about marijuana but I knew how to talk to people and sell products and manage cash. The similarities between medical marijuana and restaurants are huge. You have a product that in most cases can be looked at almost like a deli. You have got a product that starts going bad the minute you open the package and it loses moisture and it loses appeal. If you were to think of cannabis as deli meat, it sounds really funny, but the second you open that bag your product starts degrading. As for people who work in the restaurant industry, the servers and bartenders, the similarities and crossovers are huge.

<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

When we were writing our applications, Vegas was kind of looked at as the holy grail of the cannabis industry. You just look at what the city is founded on -- the city lends itself very nicely to everything that’s going on in the marijuana industry. If it gets to the recreational model things will be very interesting here. This is the only place I have ever traveled to where people are okay spending $15 for a bottle of water at a pool or a $1,000 dollars for a bottle of vodka. If those kind of inflated prices carry over to this industry, I think Vegas could hold the highest gram price in the nation -- making it a really profitable place to compete in the marijuana space.

How do you compare Nevada’s medical cannabis landscape to Colorado’s?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

You can kind of compare all these markets against one another. But what you get with every new market and every new state that opens and writes thoughtful regulation is that they have all of the other previous markets to look back on and talk with regulators and figure out what worked and what didn’t work. I think Nevada did a really good job, better than anywhere else in my opinion, on really putting thoughtful regulations together. There are so many things that work in certain spaces and don’t work in others and I think that Nevada did a really good job of navigating it and coming up with their own version of what’s important like figuring who can and can’t operate in the space. I think if you compare Colorado to Nevada, Nevada just learned from all of Colorado’s mistakes. So the state definitely has got a leg up and the regulators in my opinion are far more advanced out here. They are used to dealing with complex industries, like gaming, nothing is more confusing than gaming, where they are finding an audit trail for cash and things like that. If anybody has the wherewithal to do it, it’s Nevada in my opinion.

So far Nevada’s patients have been more driven by THC than CBD. Do you think that will change as the industry matures and patients become educated? Did Colorado go down a similar path?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

No, we didn’t. Originally when I came into the space in Colorado lab testing wasn’t mandated. A lot of things weren’t known to the consumer like what they were putting on their product. As I was leaving Colorado that’s when lab testing was being mandated and they are just kind of wrapping their hands around it. 
I think I was the first store that came to market out here that we don’t price any of our products based on THC content. The Nevada consumers were trained early on that that’s how the market was going to go. To me, some of my favorite strains have historically tested at 13, 15, 17 percent THC. You can get very high prices for those in markets like Colorado and Los Angeles so I just don’t think it’s the right model to charge patients based on THC. I compare it to alcohol, you don’t always go and order EverClear just because it’s 180-proof. Most people like to have a glass of wine and will pay more for a glass of wine that’s 13 percent alcohol versus something like Everclear or vodka. I do think the entire industry will shift more towards exactly what the consumer wants, it won’t be driven by THC or CBD really. It will be the strains everyone is looking for. It’s not necessarily that this strain is 13 percent, it will be that this strain tastes good and makes me feel good and it was exactly what I was looking for. Not everybody in the market is out to get high and I think that is a really big misconception that everybody who smokes pot is looking to get high -- that just couldn’t be further from the truth.

How has lab testing differed in the way you do business in Nevada as compared to when you were operating in Colorado? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It didn’t really change anything. My core values are growing affordable and incredibly safe medical cannabis so the lab testing to me is not a barrier of entry. It’s more of an accountability practice where patients can hold these companies accountable to safe and sustainable cultivation methods. For people who aren’t willing to go the extra mile to have good product, you aren’t going to compete in the space.

What will you (with regard to your experience in Colorado) bring to the Nevada market that isn’t already here? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

The first thing I am bringing to Nevada is changing the pricing model that everybody is accustomed to paying for THC. If you look at my location in North Las Vegas, for instance, you look at the menu and something that’s priced on our top shelf is a much lower THC or could be priced much lower than something that has high THC and I think that’s going to be my number one difference. Plus, having done this in Colorado and the scale to which we did it, I will probably be able to bring some of the cheapest product to market. So it’s really cost of goods. From a scalability aspect, having grown and processed 35,000 lbs. a year, the methods that we are cultivating are sound and very scalable.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I think Nevada has already learned everything there is to learn from Colorado. The way everybody looks at Nevada is kind of as the next frontier. With that being the case, the cultivators and operators out here have decided to come to Nevada to operate. That’s a really cool and unique opportunity for all of us because it’s the one place where the best cultivators and the best operators from across the United States are coming to operate so it makes it a little bit more of a competitive environment and it makes it more fun for me.

What will THRIVE bring to the Nevada marketplace that is unique? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

In my opinion, we bring one other thing -- when Nevada issued the licenses, somewhere near 200 for cultivation facilities and mid-60s for dispensaries -- I wanted to build a model that was not my dispensary. Branding our stores as cannabis marketplaces was really important to me. This way we can position ourselves to be the storefront for the cultivators who didn’t get storefronts. I came here to be a one-stop shop and that doesn’t include just selling my product. My product will probably only meet about 30 to 40 percent of our customers’ demands so I am looking for that other 70 percent of product so patients know they are coming into THRIVE and they can get the top cultivators and products and they don’t have to go anyplace else. It’s something different, being that storefront for those who don’t have one is important for building relationships and it’s important for making sure the patients have really easy access to the medication that they need. I am a creature of habit so stepping outside of my comfort zone of being vertically integrated was difficult, but it just made sense with the way these licenses were awarded. If you didn’t, in my opinion, you are not doing it properly.

It would be great, I think it would bring in a new set of challenges that aren’t necessarily good or bad. I think there are upsides and downsides to the possibility of rescheduling. I will believe it when I see it. I would encourage it. 
I think that comes up to this whole idea of when the industry started out of the backwoods of California and with a lot of illicit black market products. A lot of people who don’t want to jump through the regulatory loops are not going to be in favor of adding to the compliance load but the way that I look at my job in this industry is that it has very little to do with marijuana and it has everything to do with compliance. And so people who share that same viewpoint will succeed if it is rescheduled because it’s a necessity to our industry and people who are willing to get on board will do a great job and those that don’t want to deal with all of the red tape won’t do so well.

I think reciprocity is incredible. It has never really been done before. I think it has its sets of challenges and issues but I do think it’s a really interesting thing that they decided to do. 
There‘s a lot of medical patients who come to visit Vegas and flying on an airplane with your medicine that is federally illegal is an interesting issue. It doesn’t have a right or wrong answer. You hear from a lot of people who travel with theirs all the time but, to me, I wouldn’t take that risk. But a lot of people do and Vegas gives you that opportunity to not take that unnecessary risk of traveling with your illicit medicine.

What has been the most surprising thing you have discovered about cannabis since you have been involved in the industry?

<div id="collapseTwelve" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It’s shaped up to be a lot more emotional of an industry than I thought it was going to be. Sometimes you are dealing with people who are using it for chronic pain and of those chronic pain users some of them choose to go down that avenue as a way to get licensed and smoke cannabis for recreational purposes and be protected under medical laws. But then there are the other people, the 10 or 15 percent of the chronic pain users, who are using if for awful withdrawals from drugs or helping them stimulate their appetite from chemo. Some of those stories get really emotional. You get attached to cancer patients who come in daily and when they stop coming in it’s usually because they have passed away. I have been invited to more funerals in this industry than anybody probably gets invited to in a lifetime. It’s all because these families see you as this support system that’s been helping their loved ones. But usually by the time they turn to cannabis, oftentimes it’s too late, so it’s less about a cure and more about end-of-life comfort. That to me has been the most surprising thing. I didn’t anticipate getting attached to people and watching them fight for their life.

<h2>ILLINOIS</h2>
A bill to remove criminal penalties for possession of a personal amount of marijuana has passed both the House and Senate of the Illinois Legislature and will now be sent to Governor Bruce Rauner for his signature. SB 2228 would lower penalties by removing the possibility of arrest and a jail sentence for the possession of up to 10 grams of marijuana. It would also remove the possibility of a criminal record for cannabis possession, which can last a lifetime, and instead, the bill would replace criminal penalties with a fine of between $100 and $200. Once the governor officially receives the bill, he will have up to 60 days to sign it into law.

<h2>CALIFORNIA</h2>
The Golden State’s initiative to legalize and regulate marijuana is headed for the November ballot. In early May, Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, leading a coalition of supporters that included physicians, law enforcement and civil rights leaders, said the campaign had gathered approximately 600,000 petition signatures of registered voters, well above the 365,880 minimum required to qualify the initiative for the November 8th ballot. California’s Adult Use of Marijuana Act calls for a 15% tax on retail sales of cannabis.

<h2>TENNESSEE</h2>
During the final week of the 2016 Tennessee legislative session in April, Governor Bill Haslam signed HB 1478 into law, which eliminates the provision that makes a third conviction for possession of marijuana a felony. The law will take effect on July 1, 2016. This change reduces the penalty for third-time possession from between one and six years of incarceration to less than one year in jail. In addition, having a misdemeanor rather than a felony record will reduce the collateral consequences associated with the conviction. The bill also increases penalties for repeat DUI offenders and makes third-time possession of all drugs, with the exception of heroin, no longer a felony.

<h2>MAINE</h2>
In late April, state officials announced that a proposed initiative to end marijuana prohibition in Maine officially qualified for the November ballot. After a court-ordered review of petitions it had previously invalidated, the Maine Secretary of State’s Office determined the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol submitted more than the 61,123 signatures necessary to qualify. According to a new poll released this week by the Maine People’s Resource Center, nearly 54% of likely voters would approve the initiative if the election were held today. Approximately 42% said they would oppose it.  </div>

<h2>CONNECTICUT</h2>
In 2012, Connecticut enacted a medical marijuana program that allows seriously ill patients access to medical marijuana. However, the law does not allow access for minor patients. Of the 24 states that have medical marijuana programs, Connecticut is the only state that does not allow access for younger patients. A bill currently being considered, HB 5450, would allow minors to be qualifying patients. It would also allow dispensaries to distribute marijuana to hospices and other inpatient facilities and would allow nurses to administer marijuana in licensed healthcare facilities.

		<title>Patient Primer:  THE DOCTOR  DISCONNECT</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Medical cannabis in itself would give the impression that physician involvement is paramount for patient education and recommendation. Unfortunately, there is a large disconnection between physicians and medical cannabis. There is an array of reasons for this, with some of the more common explanations being its drug classification, the stigma associated with it, and lack of education surrounding medical cannabis.  </p>
<p>The New England Journal of Medicine conducted a poll in 2013 which showed the majority of clinicians would recommend the use of medicinal cannabis in certain circumstances.<sup>1</sup> This was further supported by a subsequent survey conducted by WebMD/Medscape in 2014 which showed that a majority of physicians support legalization of medical cannabis.<sup>2</sup>  </p>
<p>If the majority of physicians support medical cannabis, why aren’t more of them writing recommendations or discussing the benefits of medical cannabis with their patients? Medical cannabis is still classified as a Schedule I drug “with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse,”<sup>3</sup> thus some physicians may be reluctant to recommend it.  </p>
<p>Physicians can prescribe medications after obtaining a registration number with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), which is part of the Department of Justice (DOJ). With cannabis being federally illegal, some physicians fear repercussions from the DOJ. Physicians, who work in large groups or for hospitals, may also be discouraged from discussing or recommending medical cannabis as an option for their patients. This was seen last year at Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) in Massachusetts when CHA officials directed their providers not to certify patients “pending better evidence about the benefits and risks of marijuana.”<sup>4</sup> Physicians may also be concerned about potential liability and possible lawsuits.  </p>
<p>Most physicians also feel they do not have enough education on medical cannabis to make recommendations. The body’s endocannabinoid system and its workings are not taught in medical schools and physicians interested in medical cannabis have to do their own research. </p>
<p>In order for cannabis to become more acceptable as a medicine, physicians need to be more involved. At the very least, physicians can educate themselves about it. The more physicians get educated on medical cannabis, the more comfortable they will be in discussing it as a possible choice for appropriate patients.  </p>
<p>Medical societies also need to take the lead in educating their physician members. Most states require continued medical education (CME) for medical or osteopathic licensure renewal. The requirements vary state by state. In states where medical cannabis is legal, medical cannabis CME for providers interested in recommending this medicine might help encourage more physicians to educate themselves about it. In Nevada, Clark County Medical Society (CCMS) has taken an active role in this matter offering a CME-accredited symposium on medical cannabis this past April.  </p>
<p>The nation’s largest medical association, American Medical Association (AMA), is opposed to the legalization of cannabis; however, the AMA has called for review of the current scheduling of cannabis as a Schedule I drug.<sup>5</sup> Rescheduling of cannabis will open federal funding for research projects and allow more researchers to study cannabis. </p>
<p>Most physicians tend to practice conservatively, unless there is persuasive evidence, they tend to change their practice patterns very slowly. As more research is conducted on medical cannabis, more science-based information will be available to more accurately guide physicians, patients, and the general public.</p>
<p>Dr. Pouya Mohajer is a Diplomate of the American Board of Anesthesiology with a subspecialty in pain medicine, and founder 
of Nevada Cannabis Medical Association. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A subsidiary of Terra Tech Corp., the first publicly traded, vertically integrated medical marijuana company, <strong>Blüm</strong> dispensary has opened a Las Vegas location at 1921 Western Avenue. Blüm opened on April 20th and offers many products from local cultivations as well as Terra Tech’s exclusive concentrate line, IVXX. The dispensary also carries unsweetened topical and ingestible medications. <a href="http//www.letsblum.com" target="_blank">letsblum.com</a></p>
<p><strong>THRIVE Cannabis Marketplace</strong>, downtown Las Vegas’ largest medical cannabis dispensary at 10,000 square feet, has opened at 1112 S. Commerce. Downtown’s THRIVE Cannabis Marketplace carries the highest quality medical cannabis, including a full line of edibles, tinctures, oils and concentrates, as well as a variety of vape pens and glass pipes. Appointed with chic, urban-industrial décor designed to foster a sense of old-school charm and relaxation, the downtown dispensary features a rotating art gallery showcasing work by local artists. THRIVE’s North Las Vegas location is also open at 2755 W. Cheyenne Ave.<a href="http://www.thrivenevada.com" target="_blank">thrivenevada.com</a></p>
<p>The first of three Nevada locations of <strong>The Dispensary</strong> will open this month at 5347 S. Decatur. The other two are planned for Henderson and Reno. “One of my plans is to comingle the cultures of Reno and Las Vegas because they both have amazing products that can crossover,” explains Ryan Bondhus, menu curator and floor manager of the Dispensary.</p>
<p>With strains curated by the Dispensary’s staff of connoisseurs, cicerones, and the Canna Somm of Bake N Wake Review, Bondhus says “we will have a live menu that will always be changing and morphing to what the patient wants, what the growers are doing, and what’s the best in town. So we are never going to have a stagnant menu.”</p>
<p>The Dispensary will require its budtenders to go through a week’s worth of training, during which they will learn about the five major cannabinoids as well as the top 12 terpenes. In addition, “they will have to take a test, much like a food server would, not only on our menu, but also on the terpene and cannabinoid profiles, to make sure they are ready to stand behind the counter,” relays Bondhus. “Two times a month our budtenders are required to go to a canna class where during the first half hour I will be going through tasting notes with them, and they will meet master growers who will be on hand to personally educate the staff on their products.” <a href="http://www.thedispensarynv.com" target="_blank">thedispensarynv.com</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Division of Public and Behavioral Health (DPBH) has opened its first medical marijuana patient card application office at 2300 West Sahara Avenue, suite 800. Southern Nevada medical marijuana patients will now be able to receive a patient card on the same day they submit their application to the Las Vegas patient office.  
In a public-private partnership between the Nevada Dispensary Association and DPBH, the state is now serving Southern Nevada patients by allowing them to receive same-day approval of their medical marijuana application. The industry has worked closely with DPBH to support and set up the Las Vegas patient office. 
Dispensaries will continue to aid in the success of the office by pre-reviewing patient applications to ensure they are complete and accurate. Some of the dispensaries pre-reviewing patient applications include Inyo Fine Cannabis, Essence, Euphoria Wellness, Medizin, The Grove, Oasis Medical Cannabis, and Deep Roots. 
Senator Patricia Farley commended the application office opening, noting, “Removing barriers to simple, efficient access to medical marijuana patient cards for our state’s patients is an encouraging sign of growth in Nevada. I am impressed at the efforts the Nevada Dispensary Association and the Division have expended toward reaching the common goal of serving Nevada’s patients.” 
“This unprecedented cooperation between the Division of Public and Behavioral Health and the medical marijuana industry is an encouraging step towards a healthy, thriving industry in Nevada,” offered Riana Durrett, Nevada Dispensary Association Executive Director. “We appreciate the State’s diligent efforts.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>as presented by Tracy Fritz, M.D. at the AutismOne Conf. on May 26</i></p>


<p>Anecdotal evidence of the positive effects of cannabidiol (CBD) in children with autism has been increasingly reported over the last several years in the autism community. A growing body of scientific research continues to explore the body’s endocannabinoid system (ECS) and its potential for neurological and immunological dysfunction which is commonly seen in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related disorders. </p>
<p>Supplementation of plant-based cannabinoids, such as CBD, has been noted to have positive effects on brain and immune function in a variety of neuro-immunological disorders. I have used CBD in a clinical setting to treat common behavioral symptoms observed in ASD and PANS (pediatric acute neuropsychiatric syndrome). Symptoms amenable to treatment with CBD include, among others, sleep disturbance, anxiety/OCD, impulsivity, stimulatory behavior, nausea, emetophobia, and feeding problems. </p>
<p>I practice medicine in Missouri where medicinal cannabis has not been legalized. So the CBD-based products I use are hemp derived, and because the Food & Drug Administration has approved CBD as a nutritional supplement, it is legally available to be shipped to all 50 states.</p>

<h3 class="page-header">Why use CBD for behavioral systems?</h3>
<p>When treating autistic patients and those with PANS, the symptoms that I see most often are repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, sleep dysfunction, hyperactivity, ADHD, mood disturbances, anxiety, depression, OCD, aggression, rage, appetite disturbances such as anorexia, nausea, and fear of vomiting or emetophobia.</p>
<p>Phytocannabinoids or CBD oil is a viable intervention, specifically for mood or behavior disturbances that are difficult to treat. This is especially true because there are limitations to the pharmaceuticals that physicians are able to prescribe in an effort to try to get symptom control for children with ASD.</p>
<p>A child with PANS or autism often experiences very negative effects from medicines that may be successful for people who don’t have PANS or ASD because their blood-brain barrier is more or less intact and there’s a projectable way they metabolize and respond to the medicine. </p>
<p>A child who begins a normal starting dose of Sertraline or Zoloft can get acutely worse. They can get aggressive, their motor ticks and mood symptoms can get worse, and they can get psychotic. The same thing happens when using stimulants to control ADHD symptoms, children often have a rapid worsening of their psychiatric state. So in patients who are having behavioral and neurologic problems, the medicine physicians are comfortable giving don’t have the predictable response we are use to and can often worsen symptoms that we are trying to help. </p>
<p>An alternative like CBD is viable because it has an excellent safety record, it’s well tolerated by patients of all ages, and it can be titrated up to an effective dose. You can start with a low dose, monitor the patient closely for clinical effects, and increase the dose to find their sweet spot.</p>

<h3 class="page-header">How do you dose CBD oil? </h3>
<p>When selecting a CBD product, you want to use a quality product so make sure to get lab testing information from the dispensary or manufacturer. You want to make sure it’s a clean product, absent of heavy metals and pesticides.</p>
<p>There are different forms CBD comes in. I prefer the liquid form in an oil that is administered via sprays or squirts. Cannabinoids are extracted from the plant and added to coconut oil and because it’s a lipid molecule that helps with absorption into the body. It’s also available in a paste form which is more concentrated so I reserve that for a patient who is at a dose that is effective and I know they are going to stay at that dose. The recommended dose is the size of a rice grain and that’s a measured dose. Capsules are also an option which is another form to use.</p>
<p>Typically I will start a patient on 3 milligrams which is two squirts of CBD. It tends to work best if you do it at bedtime. It does have very minimal side effects. At the beginning some people do feel a little tired and spacey but that is short-lived. Bedtime is a good time to dose because the brain and the immune system do a lot of their balancing when you are in a nice deep sleep. </p>
<p>Typically I increase the dose by 3 milligrams weekly. Of course, everybody is different and it varies by each individual patient, but for the most part smaller patients take between 12 to 24 milligrams. Doses up to 700 milligrams a day have been studied and found to be perfectly safe.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that because the endocannabinoid system is a balancing system and you are trying to restore homeostasis, more is not always better. You don’t want to overwhelm a system that is trying to accomplish balance so start low and slow and don’t be in a hurry to increase it. </p>

<h3 class="page-header">THE POSSIBILITIES OF TREATING AUTISM WITH CANNABIS<br><span style="font-size:15px;">DR. TRACY FRITZ SHARES PATIENT CASES IN WHICH SHE USED CBD TO TREAT SYMPTOMS OF ASD. </span></h3>
<p><strong>CASE #1:</strong> I treated a nine-year-old girl with regressive autism who was diagnosed at age three. At age seven, after a strep throat infection, she developed PANS. She started on 1.5 milligrams of CBD and I increased it every couple of weeks which she tolerated very well to a dose of 6 milligrams. Of course, we were doing a lot of other things for her, but when we added CBD oil to her treatment her nighttime fears and anxiety decreased markedly. </p>
<p><strong>CASE #2:</strong> A six-year-old boy named AW who had a diagnosis of Asperger’s had a regression after a vaccination at age five with a sudden onset of acute neuropsychiatric symptoms. When I first started seeing him, he had lost 10 lbs. from the onset of nausea, anorexia and emetophobia. We started him on CBD oil and it helped him quite a bit. We dosed him once a day at bedtime. Because he would fall apart about midday, I started dosing him twice a day which worked well for him. He gained back the 10 lbs. he lost and has since gained another 12 lbs. and is happy and doing well. </p>
<p><strong>CASE #3:</strong> This patient had a regression into very severe autism as a toddler after a vaccine. She had used biomeds for 15 years and then she had an acute change in her status at 18 years old. She had a manageable life and then overnight it became unmanageable and she had the onset of anxiety and sleep disturbance along with some other neuropsychiatric symptoms. She had severe anorexia and a 22-lb. weight loss when I started seeing her. I immediately started her on CBD oil and titrated her up more quickly by giving her doses of 25 milligrams twice a day. She had a positive clinical response after five to six weeks of therapy. It took a while to have a positive effect, but she finally began to sleep. Once we got a good sleep cycle maintained for her, she started to improve in other areas with therapy. </p>

		<title>THE DEA’S SUMMER SURPRISE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) shook up the cannabis community this past April when it issued a letter to Congress stating that it “hopes to release its determination in the first half of 2016” with regard to a new scheduling determination of cannabis.<small>1</small>  </p>
<p>But what does rescheduling cannabis really mean? Let’s start by looking at the actual process and the current political environment. The United States Controlled Substances Act (CSA) defines Schedule I drugs as having a “high potential for abuse,” and no “accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.” While Schedule II drugs are still believed to have a “high potential for abuse,” they do have “currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States or a currently accepted medical use with severe restrictions.”<small>2</small></p>
<p>Several significant events have transpired recently that might point to a possible policy shift by the DEA. Those include the ongoing opioid epidemic, President Obama’s initiative to combat prescription opioid abuse, and the recent passage of the Veterans Equal Access Amendment by the House of Representatives. All three point toward a possible change in policy regarding cannabis.</p>

<h3>The Decade of Pain Control and Research</h3>
<hr>
<p>The current opioid epidemic has its roots in the 1990s. In 1996 the American Pain Society introduced the phrase: “Pain as the 5th vital sign.”<small>3</small> This concept was presented to raise healthcare provider awareness of the significance of pain assessment and its subsequent treatment.</p>
<p>The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organization (JCAHO), which accredits and certifies hospitals and other healthcare facilities, followed suit by introducing standards for pain assessment and management.  Thus, in addition to the patient’s pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, a pain assessment -- based on a numeric system of 0-10 or visual analog scale of 0-10 -- became standard. Finally, the United States Congress designated 2001-2010 as the “Decade of Pain Control and Research.”<small>4</small></p>
<p>Since primary care physicians see the bulk of patients, they began prescribing enormous amounts of opioids. Pharmaceutical companies’ marketing strategy, lack of education for primary care physicians, and a desire to “cure” pain created a recipe for disaster that is now unfolding. The ultimate goal of pain management is to maximize patient relief from suffering while minimizing the risks and side effects from opioid prescriptions. In order to curb drug abuse and addiction, while at the same time offering patients an alterative therapy, medical cannabis might be the medicine to fill some of this void.</p>
<p>President Obama recently announced a $1.1 billion initiative to address prescription opioid abuse and the nation’s heroin epidemic.<small>5</small>,<small>6</small> The initiative provides funding for access to treatment, prevention of overdose, education, and increased prevention strategies. Even though alternative forms of pain treatments were not specifically addressed, the implication is that more research and education is necessary as are other therapies to provide patients with an alternative to opioids.</p>
<p>Finally, Congress voted to permit military veterans access to medical cannabis.  The House of Representatives approved the Veterans Equal Access Amendment, which allows Veterans Affairs’ (VA) employees (1) “to provide veterans with recommendations and opinions regarding participation in their state's marijuana programs, and (2) complete forms reflecting such recommendations and opinions.”<small>7</small> Even though the VA will not pay for medical cannabis, this is a significant change in policy. I believe these recent changes might pave the way for rescheduling.</p>
<h3>What does rescheduling mean for patients?</h3><hr>
<p>There is a lot of speculation about the possible changes that will come with the reclassification of cannabis such as the lessening of current research hurdles specific to the plant. Thus, scientists will be able to perform the needed studies on medical cannabis with less bureaucratic red tape. There also appears to be some consensus that banking access will be ameliorated.</p>
<p>It is not clear what will happen to the accessibility of cannabis. As a prescription medication, the FDA has the authority to control cannabis. This could potentially affect how cannabis is grown, produced, and sold. FDA regulations are very stringent and are more restrictive than the legislative regulations set forth by the 25 states and the District of Columbia, which have legalized some form of medical cannabis.</p>
<p>Cannabis as a Schedule II drug might not be readily available to patients since the plant itself, or its specific products, has not gone through the rigorous FDA approval process (Marinol®, dronabinol, a synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, was approved by the FDA as a Schedule II drug in 1985 and moved to Schedule III in 1999 for treatment of anorexia in patients with AIDS and treatment of nausea and vomiting secondary to cancer chemotherapy).<small>8</small></p>
<p>Furthermore, pharmacists may not be able to compound cannabis-based products on a large scale due to FDA regulations. A prescription authorized by a physician must include the drug name, strength, dosage form, directions for use, and number of refills (if any) authorized.<small>9</small> At this time medical cannabis does not meet this criteria. There are independent laboratories that test medical cannabis and they can provide the chemical composition of the plant.</p>
<p>The CSA mandates that it is illegal to possess a controlled substance without a valid prescription from a physician. This can potentially cause problems in states that have made medical cannabis legal; hence, a medical product cannot be produced and sold unless the FDA has approved it. There might potentially be some conflict with the federal criminal statutes with regard to controlled substances and the states’ medical marijuana laws. Interstate transportation of controlled substances is another inconclusive area.  Finally, abiding by international drug laws and treaties, which the U.S. is a participant of, will have to be resolved. The latter is especially relevant to adult use of cannabis. 
</p>
<p>All that being said; however, the Department of Justice, through the Cole Memo, allows the operation of medical marijuana establishments (MMEs) as long as they do not violate eight priorities listed by the government.<small>10</small> There does not appear to be any evidence that this would not continue if cannabis is reclassified.</p>
<p>Rescheduling cannabis is not an easy process. If this latest petition is denied, than an alternative form of action would be for Congress to pass a law amending the CSA to transfer marijuana to another schedule or not to schedule it at all. President Obama has deferred the policy of rescheduling to Congress.<small>11</small></p>
<p>In conclusion, there are an array of unknowns and simply rescheduling cannabis might not be enough to avert these issues. The federal government will most likely have to issue some statutory and regulatory guidelines with regard to these discrepancies between federal and state laws if they are not addressed by the Cole Memo.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Even though Nevada&rsquo;s cannabis industry is still very much in its infancy, there is much speculation as to why CBD-rich strains aren&rsquo;t that plentiful in Nevada. Some believe dispensary owners are driving the demand for high-THC products. Others suggest patients just aren&rsquo;t educated enough about CBD-dominant strains. While still others contend that there have been strain limitations because the State of Nevada requires commercial cultivators to get their product solely from the state&rsquo;s patient-growers.<strong><br /> <br /> </strong>No matter what the reason is there seems to be a disconnect with regard to cannabis&rsquo; two most prominent cannabinoid compounds: THC and CBD. So far demand has been largely for THC-dominant products rather than the more healing CBD.</p>
<h3>MONEY, MONEY, MONEY </h3><p>&ldquo;Word on the street is everyone is truly focused on the THC content to create a value for some of these strains,&rdquo; explained Darin Carpenter, Director of Cultivation for Tryke Companies. &ldquo;In Nevada it seems there&rsquo;s this artificial inflation of value based off of THC content versus CBD content. There is more of a focus on how much more bang for the buck I can get versus how much of a medicating effect can I give to someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carpenter attributes it to a lack of cannabis expertise and savvy. &ldquo;There are some owners in the industry here in Nevada who aren&rsquo;t as experienced and they see THC as a value and it&rsquo;s not necessarily that -- the value comes from the full profile of the product especially the effect it can give to a particular patient. Some of the other growers that we have met with or had brief discussions with are kind of on the same wavelength as we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silver Sage Wellness&rsquo; Braly Joy agrees that value has a lot to do with the absence of high-CBD medicine in the state. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t too many people out there producing their own CBD-specific products because there&rsquo;s not money in it really. The CBD strains, the good ones, aren&rsquo;t big yielders. Most cultivation facilities aren&rsquo;t going to waste their time growing CBD, but we have CBD growing in every one of our rooms all the time,&rdquo; Joy offered of Silver Sage&rsquo;s 26,000-square-foot grow where his team is cultivating 42 strains with five that are CBD-specific and four more in the works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joy also attributes the lack of CBD-rich strains to state regulations as to where cultivators are able to to get their plants from. &ldquo;I also think it is because of the regs on acquiring genetics here in Nevada. You have to pull from patients here in Nevada, and unless you are lucky enough to come across patients who were educated and were specifically growing these strains, they are not that easy to find.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a high volume product, but it&rsquo;s something that is so very appreciated by the few that are getting it that really do need it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>IT&rsquo;S A NEVADA THING</h3><p>Easier to find are a lot of THC-dominant strains. Steve Wenger, owner of Las Vegas Herbal Growers, contends it is patients who are looking for big THC numbers because of lack of exposure to the actual product. &ldquo;When you walk into our dispensary in Colorado you see glass cases full of jars and you see the beauty of the Alien OG and how it glows from being so green and you see all of the characteristics. I grow a strain called Grape Crush, it is absolutely the most beautiful purple pot you have ever seen in your life. In Colorado Springs when we put it on our shelves, it usually lasts for an hour or a couple of hours,&rdquo; mused Wenger. &ldquo;Here in Nevada you only get to see about a gram and that has no influence whatsoever. I believe what is happening is patients are sitting in front of big-screen TVs looking at the menus and the high THC is the only thing making things stand out when they are reviewing all of their choices.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not saying it&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; continued Wenger who has two CBD-dominant strains, Medical Mass and ACDC, out of the 14 strains he is cultivating, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s probably the best way to go especially in a medical environment where we really need to keep things hermetically sealed, but it&rsquo;s just not what the industry is used to. Even buying weed on the black market, you look in the sack and see what you are getting. Seeing one gram that a dozen people have shaken, where most of the trichomes have fallen off, and all of the things that make up a really good-looking purchase are gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carpenter concurs, noting that patient demand in Nevada is much different than what is happening at Tryke&rsquo;s Arizona dispensary. &ldquo;It really seems to be a Nevada thing. I hate to pigeonhole Nevada, but in Arizona we had all walks of life coming in, there&rsquo;s the people who just want to get high and then there&rsquo;s a huge population of people who want medicine and they want medicine with a therapeutic effect,&rdquo; said Carpenter, who is currently growing 56 strains with four of them CBD-dominant and currently on the hunt for more. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s totally different to what we are accustomed to; it&rsquo;s not a bad thing, it&rsquo;s just educating the patients and some of the providers too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Highland Medical&rsquo;s Rick Turner, too, believes it&rsquo;s a matter of patient education. &ldquo;People have just simplified everything by going with the old historical buzzwords and the myth that marijuana is simply THC, but it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;THC is just one of the compounds and not any more important than the other compounds. When you are just looking at THC with the equivalent of a smattering of CBD, you don&rsquo;t have a menu at all -- it&rsquo;s a buffet that only has meat.&rdquo;&nbsp; <br /> <br /> <strong>THE REST OF THE BUFFET</strong><br /> Not to say THC isn&rsquo;t important. It&rsquo;s one of at least 85 cannabinoid compounds in cannabis, many of which have documented medical value, that make up the rest of the buffet to create cannabis&rsquo; entourage effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The compounds can do more together than they can do individually. They complement and enhance each other and have an effect that is more and different than the effects of each of the individual compounds by themselves. So that&rsquo;s what we are looking for,&rdquo; Turner explained, who is the master grower at Highland Medical, a Las Vegas cultivation focused solely on medicinal products that all have some degree of THC:CBD balance. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a synergy that occurs when there is a balance of THC and CBD. We are looking for that balance and, as a patient with my own personal experience having tried a lot of this, there is a definite difference in the product that is balanced to some degree and the product that is heavily loaded on one end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carpenter agreed. &ldquo;A lot of experienced growers and people in the industry know that the concentration of THC isn&rsquo;t necessarily a sign of quality or medication. People who like the real high THC are looking to extract it or just looking to get extremely high, they are not looking for the synergistic effects of the terpenes, it&rsquo;s just a number,&rdquo; he relayed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a synergistic effect of the THC with the various terpenes and CBDs and the biosynthetic pathways of cannabinoids and terpenoids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wenger acknowledges the entourage effect too. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I am against THC, but there is more than one cannabinoid -- it&rsquo;s not just THC, it&rsquo;s not just CBD. There&rsquo;s 85 of them and each one creates a leg of the entourage. It is amazing how many different things it can address. I believe in what&rsquo;s real and I have seen the real effects of these cannabinoids when they are working in unison.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?</h3><p>Turner looks forward to the day when state regulations require laboratories to list all of cannabis&rsquo; compounds. &ldquo;Right now the state just quantifies THC, CBD and CGN during lab testing. I would like for patients to be able to see a whole bunch of other compounds listed on their medicine because we have found the benefits of those compounds and now we can seek out focused product for our specific needs,&rdquo; he noted.</p>
<p>But before more disclosure happens on labeling, all agree that putting the onus on patients to educate themselves on which cannabis compounds work best for their disease or condition will need to happen. Not only will patients better understand how their medicine works but it may be the only way to create a demand for CBD.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really comes down to patient education, understanding what the medication is used for and educating the distributors in what they are trying to sell, not everyone is looking for THC,&rdquo; concluded Tryke&rsquo;s Carpenter. &ldquo;We have real patients who want real medicine and CBD is absolutely that.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

[one_half]
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
1 cup marijuana butter* 
(I use half butter, half cannabis butter)
4 cups brown sugar
4 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 cups unbleached flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoons sea salt
2 cups chopped walnuts or pecans
[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>DIRECTIONS:</h3>
Start by creaming together butter and brown sugar. Add eggs one at a time. Stir together well and add vanilla. Make flour mixture by combining flour, salt, and baking powder. Slowly add flour mixture to creamed mixture. Stir in chopped nuts. Pour Blondie mix into a buttered baking dish (9” x 13”) and bake at 350° for 40 minutes or until done. Cool. Cut into 2” x 2” squares.
[/one_half_last]

<h3>*HOW TO MAKE CANNABUTTER</h3><br>
[one_half]
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
1 ounce of sifted and ground bud trimmings
4 sticks of unsalted butter 
(general rule is half ounce of cannabis for every 2 sticks of butter)
Crockpot with several settings 
(warm, low, hot)
Cheesecloth
Storage container 
(Tupperware is good)
Bowl
Two large rubberbands
Grinder or blender
[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>DIRECTIONS:</h3>
<p>Turn crockpot to lowest setting. Add butter to pot. Add trimmings and stir well. Put the lid on crockpot and set a timer for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, stir it again really well. If too dry, add 1 or 2 Tbsp. more butter. Let it cook for another 15 minutes. Never overcook! Never let it get too hot! Never boil! It is done! Pour it through cheesecloth into a bowl. You should fasten the cheesecloth around the bowl using the large rubberbands. Let it cool some. Pour it into a storage container and transfer to the freezer. It will keep for up to six months in the freezer. Just take out what you need for your particular recipe and return the rest to the freezer. I often half the amount of cannabutter called for in the recipe—replacing it with plain butter. This recipe always gives me a potent (strong) cannabutter. </p>

<h2>OHIO</h2>
It’s official. Half of the states in the U.S. now have medical cannabis laws on the books. On June 8, Ohio Governor John Kasich signed HB 523 into law, bringing medical cannabis to seriously ill patients in the Buckeye State. Ohio’s medical marijuana program will not provide for smoking, nor will it allow home cultivation. The bill does include chronic and severe pain as a qualifying condition. Several agencies will administer the new medical cannabis program, including the Department of Commerce, the State Board of Pharmacy, and the State Medical Board of Ohio. These agencies are expected to start developing rules in the coming months as Ohio begins the process of creating a workable system.

<h2>ILLINOIS</h2>
On the last day of May, the Illinois Senate approved SB 10, a key bill changing the sunset date on the state’s medical cannabis program from January 1, 2018 to July 1, 2020. The House had approved the bill the day before. In addition to extending the program by two and a half years, SB 10 would allow patients with PTSD or a terminal illness to qualify for medical cannabis. It would also allow doctors to simply state that a patient has a qualifying condition, rather than recommend cannabis. Finally, SB 10 would change the process for petitioning to add medical conditions and modify the composition of the advisory board. Once received, Governor Rauner 
will have 60 days to sign the 
bill into law.

<h2>LOUISIANA</h2>
In May, Governor John Bel Edwards signed S.B. 271 into law, which makes a language amendment to existing legislation. SB 271 replaces the language relying on doctor to “prescribe” cannabis changing it to a written recommendation. Upon federal rescheduling, the law would revert to requiring cannabis to be “prescribed.” The bill also modifies the list of qualifying conditions and makes other small changes. SB 271, as amended, would remove glaucoma as a qualifying condition and would add cachexia or wasting syndrome, seizure disorders, spasticity, Crohn’s disease, muscular dystrophy, and multiple sclerosis.

<h2>VERMONT</h2>
The Vermont medical marijuana program took an important step forward in June when Governor Peter Shumlin signed S. 14, a bill that will make it possible for more patients to qualify for the medical marijuana program. “At a time when opiate addiction is ravaging our state and drug companies continue to urge our doctors to pass out painkillers like candy, we need to find a more practical solution to pain management,” Shumlin said in a statement. Specifically, the bill reduces the threshold for a pain diagnosis from “severe pain” to “chronic pain.” It also adds glaucoma as a qualifying condition, and it reduces the required provider-patient relationship from six months to 
three months.

<h2>CONNECTICUT</h2>
In May, Governor Dannel Malloy signed HB 5450, which expands medical cannabis access to pediatric patients. Connecticut’s medical marijuana program will now allow certain patients who are under 18 to access medical cannabis. To participate in Connecticut’s medical marijuana program, minors will have to have been diagnosed with a terminal illness, an irreversible spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, or severe or intractable epilepsy. In addition, they must have a written certification from two doctors — a primary care provider and a specialist. Finally, a parent or guardian must also submit a written statement of consent and attest that they will serve as the minor patient’s primary caregiver. The new law will go into effect October 1.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A parent who has a child suffering from autism and seizures may look to medical cannabis as a treatment option when traditional options have failed. Nevada’s medical marijuana laws specifically address an individual acting as a caregiver and create duties and requirements for the designated caregiver defining them as: </p>
<p><i>A caregiver is an individual over the age of 18 with significant responsibility for managing the well-being of an individual who is a medical cannabis patient and who has been designated and approved as that patient’s caregiver</i></p>
<p>If a patient needs or wants a caregiver, the patient must designate a specific individual as his or her caregiver by submitting forms to the Nevada Division of Health and Human Services, or visiting <a href="https://mmportal.nv.gov">https://mmportal.nv.gov</a>.</p>
<p>It is important to note that a patient under the age of 18 can only receive a medical marijuana patient card if the parent or legal guardian agrees to be the designated caregiver. A patient can only designate one caregiver and that caregiver must be a resident of Nevada, approved by a physician, consent to being the caregiver and pass a background check.</p>
<p>A caregiver is given the same protections from state prosecution as a patient once the caregiver obtains a registration card. However, just like a patient, the caregiver must act within the law, which includes being able to:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 30px;">
     <ul>
	<li>purchase up to 2.5 ounces of usable marijuana 
		every 14 days for the patient</li>
	<li>purchase from the patient’s designated dispensary 
		(once dispensaries open)</li>
	<li>grow up to 12 plants until a dispensary opens in the county</li>
     </ul>
</div>
<p>Also, the caregiver is responsible for managing the well-being of the patient including purchasing the medical cannabis and overseeing the dosage and frequency of use. </p>
<p>Please remember cannabis remains illegal under federal law, therefore, being a caregiver carries a certain amount of risk. A caregiver should contact an attorney to get a better understanding of the law and the risks when considering becoming a caregiver.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>THE  ACCIDENTAL CANNABIS  FARMERS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“I never fathomed we could be here,” offers Nathan Coombs, with a bit of wonder in his voice, as a quick follow-up to an explanation he has just finished about the nutrient value of worms and their castings when growing cannabis. </p>
<p>His partner in crime (yes, I guess you could call her that since cannabis is still federally illegal although legal according to California law) and the Autism & Compassionate Care Connection finishes his thought. </p>
<p>“All we wanted was to just stop the seizures or at least stop having them so much,” Rhonda Morris continues in an imploring manner so pitched with emotion it would stop anybody opposed to medical cannabis on a dime. “I remember when Maria (Nathan’s wife) was thinking about doing it, she called me up. She was crying because Adrian (the Coombs’ son) had just had six seizures in one day, and she said, ‘I am going to watch him die on the floor. I want to go try the cannabis.’ Then she asked me what I thought and I said, ‘Well, you aren’t going to hurt him. Let’s try it.’”</p>
<p>So began the journey of three desperate parents trying to find relief for their autistic children. The Coombs’ have two autistic sons and Rhonda has a son with Asperger’s and a daughter with severe autism. To hear their six-year journey is to understand the testament of a parent’s love for their child. </p>
<p>The trio formed Autism & Compassionate Care Connection, a cannabis collective in San Bernardino, California, in 2011 by happenstance. Its formation was just one long series of roadblocks that inevitably led to “let’s try it.” Maria initially got the idea of giving her son cannabis in 2010 after seeing a show on a primetime TV news magazine about a mom who was using medicinal cannabis to treat her autistic son. After getting her caregiver recommendation from the state of California, Maria and Rhonda set out to visit a dispensary. </p>
<p>Imagine two moms on a mission to buy medicinal cannabis in a seedy part of town near a Strip club where employees are out front trying to flag down patrons for lap dances. It sounds like a Tina Fey and Amy Poehler caper. Rhonda remembers it as “ridiculous. And it’s so intimidating if you are new to it. It was this really rinky-dink place with these young guys who looked gangstery. They had no information of what would help our kids and their sales pitch was basically, ‘This is good shit, totally top shelf.’ It was just ridiculous.” </p>
<p>Undaunted, the two bought some cannabis only to get home and realize they had no idea what to do with it. They called the doctor who had made the strain recommendation and because he wasn’t home his wife told them how to prepare it. She told Maria and Rhonda to bake the cannabis in a little bit of coconut oil at 290° for 10 minutes and then grind it up and put it in capsules. They did and to their amazement it worked.</p>
<p>“We didn’t even know what we were doing and it still worked,” Rhonda says with a laugh. </p>
<p>“Adrian was having seizures weekly and then when we started him on cannabis, he went three months with no seizure and that was after he was having them every week,” says Nathan. </p>
<p>“It took the edge off. It calmed him down and he became more verbal. Day to day living became more bearable,” explains Maria of cannabis’ benefits. </p>
<p>Here is where the story takes yet another “let’s try it” turn. Maria and Rhonda returned to the dispensary to get more of the same strain of cannabis but this time it caused Adrian to break out in a rash and hives. </p>
<p>They went back to the dispensary only to find out it sourced its flower from different growers. So even though it might have been the same strain as Coombs purchased the first time, it was probably from another grower and very well might have been grown with pesticides or even could have been subject to heavy metals and mold because back in 2010 California didn’t require testing. The Coombs knew they couldn’t give their child medicine with unknown origins. </p>
<p>“We decided that in order to control the quality and integrity of the plant, since we are dealing with little sick kids, we needed to grow our own,” explains Nathan. </p>
<p>Next thing they knew, the trio, along with Rhonda’s mom, was in Pasadena taking growing classes. To say they didn’t know much about plants is putting it lightly. “We knew nothing,” offers Rhonda. “They even had to show us how to put soil in the pot.” </p>
<p>But like everything else, they picked it up quickly and soon Rhonda was cloning plants, Maria was making the medicine, and Nathan was farming the cannabis when </p>
<p>he could. </p>
<p>Nathan, who at the time was a high school teacher by day and taught college courses at night, was “like “Breaking Bad.” I went from the most conservative industry on the high school and university level to growing cannabis. At the end of 2013 I retired from there to focus on this business because my wife and Rhonda can’t raise autistic children and run this business. They said I needed to come home. I did and it’s the best decision I ever made. I would much rather be out there farming, and creating medicine for sick children and helping families then to be in a classroom with a lot of students who don’t want to be there.” </p>
<p>Since opening ACCC in 2011, they have treated approximately 100 clients with 90 percent afflicted with pediatric autism and epilepsy. They have also made medicine for patients with cancer, arthritis, insomnia, and Angelman Syndrome. The strains ACCC grow vary but are all pesticide-free, chemical-free, and completely organic and are turned into oils, tinctures and pills. “We have strains all over the map with different ratios because everybody responds differently. We are treating different symptoms that need to be treated with different strains and different ratios of THC to CBD,” explains </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Nathan, who notes they have high THC/low CBD, high CBD/low THC, and everything in the middle.</p>
<p>As for picking the correct strain for the clients, Nathan says, “it’s not an exact science, we make an educated guess based on our experience and based on the gender of the child and what symptoms they are trying to treat. </p>
<p>“We also give samples of other strains and pills so they can try it out because it’s a hit and miss thing. People want to turn this into an exact science because we are stuck in a pharmaceutical box. We are conditioned that way, but we are going to have to step out of the conditioning because it doesn’t always apply to a plant that’s growing wild. We always have the parents monitor them and see which strain is going to work best. There’s some trial and error, but we always find it.”</p>
<p>Nathan always emphasizes to the parents he meets with that “cannabis is not a cure for autism, it is not a cure for epilepsy. They will seize but they will seize less, and a lot of the behaviors can be mitigated or controlled with cannabis and it helps in that way. It helps with a lot of the symptoms but we have never said it was a cure.”  </p>
<p>In spite of it not having curative powers, parents of children with autism are still game to try just about anything. “We don’t have to talk anybody into anything. They call us. They are at their wit’s end, and the sad thing is we are the last case scenario. This is what people should be doing first, first do no harm, but it’s always a last ditch attempt before I put my child in an institution, it shouldn’t be that way, it should be the reverse but that’s how it is.”</p>
<p>The stress of constantly receiving phone calls from frantic and desperate parents may seem overwhelming, but not for a trio who has compassionate in the very name of their business. “We are a godsend to these people, but they are a godsend to us, too. We get so much from them just in consultation. A lot of our time is not just spent in growing and processing, but the bulk of our job is consultation and therapy. We travel and meet them at a halfway point to get them their medicine and then they want to talk. They know we are people who understand their plight and they want to talk about what’s happened over the last two weeks. </p>
<p>“That’s a crucial part of what we do, it’s not just cannabis or growing and processing, it’s consultation and talking people off ledges and talking people through the process, asking how things went last week and asking if they need to cry and telling them to go ahead and cry. </p>
<p>“And we cry with them.” </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Julie Vigil</h4>
<p>Early in their son’s life, Jim and Pam Blasco felt something was amiss. James was slow to reach developmental milestones like walking and talking, and their doctor’s reassurances that their baby boy was still within the outer limits of the norms didn’t quiet Pam’s maternal instincts. </p>
<p>They left Las Vegas — a place that in the mid-’70s was not exactly an oasis of medical choices — for California in search of a pediatric neurologist and answers. They took James to see many doctors, but one in particular, a behavioral M.D. who specialized in kids with disabilities and deficits, dealt the Blascos a devastating blow.</p>
<p>“He told us to just go buy Easter Seals,” Pam said. </p>
<p>“And drop him off at Social Services and never see him again,” Jim continued.</p>
<p>“Can you imagine?! He was 2½,” Pam said. “We </p>
<p>didn’t even know how to respond. Of course we ignored </p>
<p>all that nonsense.”</p>
<p>Eventually, Jim and Pam got an answer, but it only led to more questions. James was found to have calcifications on the frontal lobes of his brain. Then a handful of years later, their third child, Andrew, was diagnosed with the very same condition, but more aggressive. These calcifications are microscopic and wreak havoc on their behavior, fine and gross motor skills, and problem-solving abilities.</p>
<p>“One son talks, the other doesn’t,” Jim said. “Both of them would be classified in the slow range but they could never live by themselves.”</p>
<p>“They’re 41 and 36 now,” Pam said, “and they’re always going to need supervision 24 hours, seven days a week.”</p>
<p>Growing up, the boys went through public school and now live in a group home at New Vista, a local nonprofit that supports individuals with intellectual challenges. </p>
<h3>BUILDING COMPASSION</h3>
<p>The Blasco family, Jim and his father, Joe, before him, are pioneers in local building industries, counting the development of 1983’s Spanish Trails neighborhood — Las Vegas’ first luxury master-planned golf community — among their many accomplishments. But real estate wasn’t the only community that the Blascos were instrumental in introducing and developing in the valley.</p>
<p>“We built the first group homes in Nevada,” Jim said, “and gave them to the state. We also brought in the first homeopaths in Nevada. So, we’ve been involved in alternate medicines for the special needs communities for 30 years.”</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2014. Jim and Pam’s nephew Chris Sarret approaches them with an idea to start a company in Nevada’s nascent medical marijuana industry -- with the feeling that this misunderstood and under-researched plant could help people by offering an all-natural alternative to the pharmaceuticals typically prescribed. </p>
<p>Obviously a topic the Blascos would be very interested in finding more out about. “My wife did some research,” </p>
<p>Jim said. “We have always been the stewards of our children, especially with the amount of medication they’ve been prescribed.”</p>
<p>Throughout their lives James and Andrew have been on so many different medications, Jim and Pam have always worried about the long-term effects prescription drugs are having on their sons’ mental and physical well-being. </p>
<p>“When we go to the psychiatrist and they prescribe medication for them,” Jim said, “we’re basically giving them something that’s killing them. It does control (their seizures), there’s no question about that, it controls their behavior.”</p>
<p>But at what cost?</p>
<p>“We’re learning that a lot of these medications are creating problems like early-onset dementia or sudden death. It is very frightening to me,” Pam said. </p>
<p>She concedes that in comparison to what used to constitute standard mental health care — chains, ice baths, electroshock therapy, lobotomies — the psychiatric drugs are a step in the right direction. </p>
<p>But Pam, who’s always been open to holistic healing practices like yoga and meditation, wanted to take a closer look at cannabis as an alternative medicine over pharmaceuticals for special needs people. “Now we have a whole plant that we can utilize that has no harmful side effects. The opportunities are tremendous.</p>
<p>“After going into a lot of consideration and prayer and mediation about it,” Pam added, “the answer came through that this is something that could help people. It really could help people.”</p>
<h3>ON YOUR MARK, GET SET, GO!</h3>
<p>Once Jim and Pam decided to go for it, the clock started ticking. Sarret’s business idea appealed to them, but the complex application required for the state’s first medical marijuana establishments was due in three weeks. </p>
<p>Three weeks! </p>
<p>“We didn’t have any idea how hard this application was or what a big deal it was, to be honest with you,” he said.</p>
<p>Jim and Pam dismissed the notion of having a business partner because the mission they had in mind was so distinctive. “Our focus was going to be on special needs. We didn’t know a damn thing about the (medical marijuana) business, (but) we have since totally bought into the issue. More and more, you’re not going to ‘fix’ kids with special needs, but you can make their quality of life better,” Jim said.</p>
<p>They also had to decide which licenses to apply for. “If we were going to do this, we wanted to do it seed-to-sale,” explained Pam. “Jim didn’t want to do the dispensary at first, but I said no, we need the dispensary. If we’re selling a product, I want to know what it is, and the only way I’m going to know that is if we grow it, and to grow we gotta sell it.”</p>
<p>“We ended up getting all three licenses (cultivation, production and distribution),” Jim said. “I don’t know how, but we did.”</p>
<p>After submitting 9,000 pages of required information for the applications literally one minute before the 4 p.m. filing deadline, they immediately got to work facing a steep learning curve with a timeline that was tight, and the regulations, roadblocks, and to-dos plentiful. But they made their way, found an industry partner in Denver's oldest and longest-running dispensary, Denver Relief, and began another chapter in their family story. </p>
<p>“We’re growing a plant — for medicine,” Pam said. </p>
<p>“The first time I walked into a grow room, I just started crying because I saw all of these plants and realized their potential was medicine. It was amazing. It was so overpowering to be in that room and realize that they were going to be medicine. And you know, medicine goes across the board. It’s not just for seizures, or Parkinson’s, or arthritis, it’s for people who need a lift, who aren’t feeling well, ya know? I just can’t find the bad anywhere.”</p>
<h3>ALL IN THE FAMILY</h3>
<p>Now that their Silver Sage Wellness cultivation, production facility, and dispensary are finally open, the Blascos’ passion for compassion is coming to fruition again. </p>
<p>“I feel like we’re a pharmacy, honestly, like we say, a helpful lifestyle pharmacy,” Pam said. “We have a lot of repeat people; we’re already building a clientele and we’ve only been open two months.”</p>
<p>The draw is magnetic. The atmosphere is harmonic. No wonder people want to be there. “(Silver Sage Wellness is) kind of like a mom-n-pop because it’s Jim and I, and we’re surrounded by all these very young people. It’s incredible. It’s like a magnet and they seem to be drawn to us because of our passion and compassion, and because they have passion for the plants.”</p>
<p>They’ve definitely created one big, happy family, and at only a few months in, they’ve only just begun. Pam has set her sights on bringing more family members into the SSW fold. Their son-in-law Braly Joy is the general manager and sons, James and Andrew, are on deck with plans for each of them to have a job at the dispensary. James, with the right job coach, will be a greeter, and Andrew can either be part of a yard crew or cleaning crew. </p>
<p>“It’s the love,” Pam said. “Everything is stemming from love: Our boys, our sons, they are coming from love; Jim and I are coming from love, everything we do with this is from love; bringing our family in, that comes from love; Chris was drawn to us because of that same thing, that passion — and you can’t have that passion slash compassion without the love.”</p>
<p>Even the family dog has been tapped for service. Gracie — a young Bouvier des Flandres — is currently working with a trainer to become a service dog and will eventually be allowed in the dispensary.</p>
<p>“You know animals are very, very intuitive so she’ll know who she needs to go over to and who she needs to leave alone. She’ll be a presence but she won’t be invasive,” explained Pam. </p>
<h3>MONEY CAN’T BUY ME LOVE</h3>
<p>From the moment their nephew suggested the idea of starting a medical marijuana company until today as Silver Sage Wellness is a thriving grow, production facility, and medical dispensary some two-and-a-half years later, the Blascos understood this endeavor wouldn’t be easy. From the tremendous emotional investments to the multimillion-dollar financial expenditures, it’s been an uphill climb. But that’s okay. They only have to look at James and Andrew for inspiration.</p>
<p>“We’re who we are today because of them, our whole family is. You cannot have two sons with such tremendous gifts — in a different way of looking at gifts — and not be touched by them because what those boys have to do every day just to get up and get out, I mean, they’re mobile, but everything they do is an effort. It doesn’t come easy for them. None of it,” explained Pam.</p>
<p>The Blasco’s philanthropic intention of helping people, whether in special needs communities or not, is pure and their hearts really do point a true north. </p>
<p>“Our final goal we can’t do yet because of federal regulations,” Jim said. “We would like to give it away to the special needs community. We’re committed enough that if there’s a particular strain for a particular person, we’ll grow that one plant. I know it doesn’t sound like much but that’s a big deal.”</p>
<p>“(And) if someone comes in from a low-income situation and they can’t afford to get medicine, we want to be able to provide it,” Pam added. “It’s medicine. Sure we understand it’s a business. We have to pay our employees, we have to run a business, and that takes money so it has to be profitable. But at the end of the day, we’re not in it just to take, that’s not what this is about. It’s about giving. </p>
<p>“Off the top we said we were going to give 30 percent of our profit and put it toward research and development,” she continued, “and I know that’s a broad term, but we definitely want to advance cannabis, and in order to do that we have to put money into research.”</p>
<p>When Silver Sage Wellness dispensary opened on March 25, the Blascos’ attorney Dayvid Figler looked at Pam and asked, “What if someone comes by and offers you $10 million for your store?” </p>
<p>She looked at him and simply said, “No.” Then he asked again, “What about $20 million?” She calmly said, “It’s not for sale, Dayvid. It’s not about selling, it’s not about the money. It is about making a difference. Really, it’s about making a difference, improving the quality of people’s lives in any way we can with cannabis.” </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>PATIENT SEES THE GREEN LIGHT AND USES CBD OIL IN  TREATMENT OF LIVER CANCER</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Billy Calabrese will be the first to tell you he’s on a mission from God. “This is something that’s been kept under wraps for too long and we need to help everybody,” the 70-year-old says of CBD oil. “For the rest of my life I am going to spread the word, this is truly my mission.”</p>
<p>Calabrese started seeking CBD oil about a year ago, nine months after a September 2014 diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Calabrese’s cancer diagnosis, which included two tumors measuring 5.7 centimeters and 5.3 centimeters, most likely resulted from a lengthy battle with Hepatitis C. </p>
<p>“I did a lot of holistic things – foods and exercise and I overpowered this disease for 20 years but it was taking its toll and I was getting worse. I did milk thistle and different cleanses, I did steroids and testosterone. I was a doctor without a license,” he says with a laugh, offering that he opted to “fix himself” with regard to his two-decade struggle with Hepatitis C rather than see a physician. </p>
<p>Calabrese’s penchant for avoiding doctors and fixing himself is what led him to CBD oil. He initially started taking a commercial form of CBD oil a year ago, but it wasn’t until he started taking a form of Rick Simpson Oil (RSO) two-and-a-half months ago that he saw real results.  </p>
<p>“The first day it hit me kind of hard. It kind of had a heavy effect on me, the next day was a little better, and each day was a little better. By the week’s end, I knew something was going on,” Calabrese explains of using cannabis oil. </p>
<p>Before taking CBD oil, Calabrese explains he “was totally bedridden. I didn’t want to take care of myself, I was like gone, my legs looked like sticks, my body was really depleted. My thinking also was very disrupted and you got to be on your game to be in real estate. It’s a dogfight, and you gotta be on your toes and I lost all those abilities, things just weren’t coming together. I couldn’t remember my computer codes. I wasn’t myself at all,” the former realtor notes. </p>
<p>After taking CBD oil “it was just a complete turnaround, I was getting stronger, my mind was remembering things. Now, I am up at 5 a.m., pumping iron, doing my pushups, doing my abs, working out again, taking my dog to the park, taking care of a lot of household things.” </p>
<p>Although Calabrese rejected his oncologist’s offer of chemotherapy and radiation following his 2014 diagnosis, he’s thinking of going back now. “I don’t believe I still have the tumors. I want to go back for the comparisons; that’s it,” he explains of checking to see if the tumors have disappeared. “I am very early in this. I want to show them more; I want my body to be better and my mind to be better before I go back.” </p>
<p>If Calabrese returns to his oncologist and finds the tumors haven’t gone away, he’s still happy with his results. “This is a total miracle and if I die tomorrow, I had two good months. I feel so good, you wouldn’t even believe it. I was facing death, and God put it here to heal me. That’s the whole thing in a nutshell. This oil saved my life,” Calabrese offers. “I was fighting death and it was laughing at me. I had a dream and I could see myself laying there and I could see a green light around me and Lord was telling me you’re healing. And I did.” </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>THE ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Stephen McCamman</h4>
<p>What happens in your body when you smoke or eat medical marijuana? In 1964, Dr. Raphael Mechoulam asked this same question after observing lab monkeys acting unusually mellow after being dosed with hash. Rumors that the monkeys ordered pizza are still unconfirmed, but Mechoulam's quest for answers led to the discovery of the endocannabinoid system (eCB) in the late 1980s. Named in honor of the cannabis plant, the eCB's role in the body is to help many important systems and organs stay in balance, or maintain physiological homeostasis. In fact, some scientists think that a deficiency in the eCB is the root cause of many ailments, which explains why medical marijuana helps alleviate so many different diseases and conditions. </p>
<h3>WHAT IS THE eCB?</h3>
<p>While researchers have uncovered the structure and functions of the eCB, more research and human studies are needed before doctors can use this knowledge in a clinical setting. What we do know is that the eCB is in effect a biochemical communication network of hormones, called endocannabinoids and cell receptors known as CB1 and CB2, that play an integral role in keeping a wide array of very important bodily functions such as sleep, digestion, relaxation, memory, and neuroprotection operating within tight parameters. In other words, it keeps the bodily systems from either underperforming or overacting, in cases such as autoimmune disorders or epileptic seizures.</p>
<p>It helps to think of the eCB network as part of the body's World Wide Web, a chemical language of healing and balance that tells the various systems and organs in the body -- our biological Internet -- how to respond to not only injury, stress, and disease, but also to positive stimulation, such as exercise, massage, chiropractic work, and healthy eating. </p>
<h3>YOUR BODY'S OWN MARIJUANA (ENDOCANNABINOIDS)</h3>
<p>Discovered in 1995, Anandamide and 2-AG are called the body's marijuana due to their similarity in chemical structure to THC. Residing in the outer layer of certain cells, these endocannabinoids (endo means inside) are released when triggered by things such as injury, disease, or exercise, for that matter. </p>
<p>Called the Bliss Molecule because it causes a sense of well-being, Anandamide (AEA) attaches to the CB1 receptors in the brain and CB2 receptors in the peripheral nervous system. THC also attaches to this same receptor and is what causes you to feel high. AEA and THC play a key role in modulating pain, emotion, and hunger, thus the reason why some people get the munchies when they smoke marijuana. AEA has also been cited as the cause of the well-known runner's high and small traces are found in chocolate, as if you need an excuse to nibble on some Godiva goodies.</p>
<p>2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), on the other hand, is found in the central nervous system and immune system and plays a critical role in controlling inflammation, immune system response, and modulating neurotransmitters. 2-AG is expressed in breast milk and has been shown to inhibit some types of cancer cell growth. Scientists have suggested that other endocannabinoids exist but their function and role have yet to be fully understood.</p>
<h3>CB1 AND CB2 RECEPTORS: PATHWAYS INTO THE CELL</h3>
<p>What happens when AEA and 2-AG are released in response to outside stimuli? As mentioned, endocannabinoids attach to receptors on the cell wall that act as a conduit for the biochemical signals to get inside the cell. So far, scientists have identified several receptors in the eCB system – the most prominent being CB1 and CB2. CB2 receptors are located in the gut, often called our second brain, and the immune system, playing a critical role in reducing inflammation and promoting well-being.</p>
<p>The critical part is that once the endocannabinoid is attached to the receptor, it triggers a second messenger inside the cell and this is where the magic happens: The internal cell workings change in response, in turn causing the internal chemistry of the cell to promote healing. In the case of apoptosis, or cell death, the second messenger tells the cell to commit suicide, a key function, especially in the case of out of control cancer cells. Again, scientists have not yet uncovered the entire scope of the receptor system, a third receptor TRPV1, for example, has recently been identified, and more research is required before we fully understand the number of receptors in the eCB</p>
<h3>CANNABIS AND YOUR eCB (PHYTOCANNABINOIDS)</h3>
<p>Thankfully, nature has provided us with the cannabis plant, which has over 80 cannabinoids, and supplement our own endocannabinoids, either as a food source or when smoked. The two most important are THC and CBD. THC  goes directly to the CB1 and CB2 receptors like the endocannabinoids mentioned above. THC is the psychoactive cannabinoid that gets you high, and is most effective in treating pain, PTSD, nausea, and, of course, as an appetite stimulant.</p>
<p>CBD, which is also found in Hemp, keeps your own endocannabinoid AEA available to the receptors, and exerts its health benefits through channels other than CB1 and CB2 receptors. CBD is primarily anti-inflammatory, anti-spasmodic, and a neuroprotectant, which has captured the interest of both the National Football League (NFL) and Alzheimer's researchers. Again, research is limited and other cannabinoids such as CBN, THCa, and CBG all offer therapeutic benefits -- the scope and efficacy of which have yet to be fully understood.</p>
<h3>ENDOCANNABINOID DEFICIENCY SYNDROME: ONE DEFICIENCY WITH MANY FACES</h3>
<p>Researchers are positing that a large number of diseases may actually be due to a deficient eCB, which has been termed clinical endocannabinoid deficiency syndrome (CECD). As a result of the current state of the American diet, the eCB is deficient in fatty acids, enzymes, and other biochemical precursors necessary for the eCB to operate at an optimal level. Fibromyalgia, migraines, and gastrointestinal ailments have been linked to this deficiency and widespread anecdotal reports on the efficacy of a well-regulated eCB in combating these treatment resistant problems are widespread.</p>
<p>In other words, people are using a biochemical dial-up modem when a few changes in diet and consumption of medical cannabis, or non-psychoactive cannabinoids such as CBD, can bring them into the age of fiber optic cables, thereby speeding recovery. By regulating the eCB with good nutrition and supplements -- recall how the eCB is involved in numerous important physiological processes -- you can dial back diseases, increase your sense of well-being, and lead a healthy, balanced life.</p>
<p>All of us -- medical professionals, medical marijuana patients, and even opponents of medical marijuana -- owe a huge debt to the cannabis plant, Dr. Mechoulam, and his (allegedly) pizza grubbing monkeys for discovering the eCB. As the research continues, we know that properly regulating the eCB through diet and exercise, coupled with the healing power of medical marijuana, holds great promise for cancer treatment, managing numerous other ailments, and contributing to our overall health and wellness. </p>

<h4>By Stephen McCamman</h4>
<p>While the adage, “If you're old enough to know better, you're too old to do it,” may hold true for such things as hitting the nightclubs on the Strip, the one exception to this rule is taking care of your health. As we age, the aches and pains seem to accrue as fast the prescription bottles in our medicine cabinet. Unfortunately, these days it seems like the only solution is more and more pills, which just seems to cause more and more problems. </p>
<p>Until now. Scientists have identified what may be the underlying cause of many intractable health issues: Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency Syndrome (CEDS). CEDS is a deficiency of our body's own marijuana, hormones called endocannabinoids. Healthy lifestyle choices, primarily diet, sleep and exercise, are necessary for our body to keep producing these hormones and this is important because they are responsible for ensuring our bodies operate at an optimal level.</p>
<p>As we slow down and the world keeps speeding up, the stress and pace of our American lifestyle and diet contribute to this deficiency. Migraines, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are the first set of co-morbidity -- meaning they appear together -- ailments stemming from an endocannabinoid deficiency.</p>
<p>The usual indications of old age -- arthritis, dementia, depression and even cancer -- may also be a result of CEDS. The science is not settled on these other tyrants of the aging process but research and overwhelming anecdotal evidence suggests that regulating the endocannabinoid system at the very least alleviates the symptoms of these serious diseases. In addition, compelling new research suggests that environmental toxins, such as pesticides and phthalates -- a chemical compound found in almost everything under the sun, including water bottles, all of your bathroom products, and even in pharmaceutical pills -- may disrupt your eCB system. </p>
<p>While medical cannabis and hemp-based CBD are a first line of attack against CED syndrome, financial, social or employment concerns may keep people from accessing these medicinal products. Not to worry, since CED syndrome is essentially a nutrient deficiency, dietary changes are a good start. Emerging research indicates that other plant and food sources also provide nutrients that can help alleviate the deficiency. Below are three simple changes you can make in your diet to get you on the highway to health.</p>
<h3>GORGE ON OMEGAS</h3>
<p>While a daily dose of Omega 3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) is crucial for overall wellness, it’s also necessary for the production of our body's endocannabinoids. It’s also important to balance EPA and DHA with the proper ratio of Omega 6, thus creating the perfect biochemical precursors necessary to produce, in effect, your body's own marijuana.</p>

<p>The American diet already has an overabundance of an Omega 6, called linoleic acid, which is found in common household cooking oils and numerous processed foods (check your labels and throw out anything with linoleic acid in it). If you are eating a lot of fish, or using fish oil supplements as your Omega 3 source, be careful as these may have mercury in them. </p>
<p>A high dose of EPA/DHA is beneficial for brain function, reduction in inflammation, behavior and mood regulation, and cellular rejuvenation – all functions of an optimal eCB system. The scientific consensus is a recommended daily dose of 500 mg of EPA/DHA through diet and supplements. Other researchers recommend up to 2500 mg a day, which would require a supplement. </p>
<p>Hemp seeds, not surprisingly, are the best source of essential fatty acids as they contain a perfectly balanced 3:1 ratio of Omega 6 (linoleic acid/LA) to Omega 3 (alpha-linoleic /LNA) and, in turn, are aptly called "nature's most perfectly balanced oil." </p>
<h3>BEEF UP THE BETA</h3>
<p>Beta-caryophyllene (BCP) is an essential oil found in many plants and foods, including cannabis. In 2008, researchers publishing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science identified BCP as a dietary cannabinoid, the first non-cannabis compound to attach to the cannabinoid receptors in the gut. Studies on mice suggest that it may even turn out to be an authentic plant-based cannabinoid, acting on the same receptors in our body as medical cannabis.</p>
<p>BCP has anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, antioxidant, anti-carcinogenic and local anesthetic activities, and contributes significantly to the medicinal benefits of cannabis. BCP is found in many common foods (see list on page 11) and is available wherever essential oils are sold. Specific dosing guidelines are not available, but including these BCP-rich foods in a well-rounded diet will ensure your body is getting the cannabinoids it needs.</p>
<h3>FEAST ON FLAVONOIDS</h3>
<p>Lastly, flavonoids, those compounds that give fruits and vegetables their bright colors, are natural Anandamide re-uptake inhibitors. In other words, they keep Anandamide more available to your endocannabinoid receptors and have numerous health benefits aside from this function, including anti-oxidation, anti-inflammation, and perhaps even anti-tumor properties, most likely via endocannabinoid regulation. </p>
<p>Kaempferol was identified as the most potent flavonoid and is available in teas, fruits and vegetables (see list on page 11). The USDA estimates that in the U.S. daily total flavonoid consumption by the average adult is approximately 250-275 milligrams, with about half of total consumption coming in the form of flavan-3-ols from black and green tea. </p>
<p>Remember, if food-based solutions aren't working for your health issue, a quick trip to your local dispensary can jump start your endocannabinoid system. However, if you follow these dietary guidelines, along with other sensible health strategies such as exercising, hydrating and getting a good night’s sleep, you may be in the fortunate position of not only being old enough to know better, but also  feeling young enough at heart to actually get out there and do it. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“What’s the big deal?” asks Dorothy Hover, 80. “It just takes away the pain,” she remarks of the cannabis troche, a lozenge almost the size of a sugar cube, she takes nightly to manage chronic back pain resulting from three back surgeries. </p>
<p>Hover’s not the only person in her age group who thinks cannabis is no big deal. Those 55 and older are now the fastest-growing demographic of cannabis users in the country, according to CBS News, which reported that between 2013 and 2014, the number of users increased from 2.8 million to 4.3 million. </p>
<p>“When I first started doing this at the dispensaries, you get a stereotype of the type of people that you are going to see walking in the door and that is just crushed,” says Dr. Troutt, Director of Medical Education for local dispensary The+Source. “If you spend any time there at all, just throw those stereotypes out the window. The main individuals coming in are elderly people in wheelchairs, using canes, dealing with some very significant medical problems who are looking for relief with this newly available medicine.”</p>
<p>As for the rapid increase in senior patients, Dr. Troutt pins it on the fact that 25 states now have some form of legal medical marijuana program. “Since the passage of the medical marijuana programs state by state and the publicizing of all the new research on the endocannabinoid system and potential benefits of cannabis, we are seeing a huge increase in our senior individuals who are interested in this medicine,” explained Dr. Troutt, who has been educating patients about cannabis since 2010 in his home state of Arizona. </p>
<p>But it hasn’t just been new research and media reports educating the senior set about cannabis. Family members have been influential too. “Many times people will come up to me and quietly say, ‘You know my child or grandchild has been urging me to come in here and find out about this medicine and try it.’ So I think family is probably the biggest way people are hearing about it,” says Dr. Troutt. </p>
<p>That’s how 83-year-old Adrienne Glusman found out about cannabis. “My grandkids told me to try CBD. These kids with the internet know about everything,” says Glusman, who uses a CBD-dominant hybrid of Medical Mass and Harlequin strains for a pinched nerve. “My grandkids told me about Charlotte’s Web. They came over and showed me on the YouTube and I thought if it didn’t hurt a five-year-old, it’s not going to hurt me.”</p>
<p>Dr. Timothy Beckett sees lots of patients who have ailments similar to Glusman’s. He only opened Valley Center for Cannabis Therapy in April, but Dr. Beckett estimates 50 or 60 percent of the clinic’s patient base are over the age of 60 and are being sent to him by their doctors for “severe rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, back pain and surgery that didn’t help. Some of the oncology groups in town are starting to send their patients to us. I also get a lot of referrals from pain doctors sending patients who have been on opioids for years. Most of those patients have already tried the pharmaceutical route, they have been on some of these medications for years and they just don’t work anymore and they want an alternative.”</p>
<p>That’s why Hover found herself at Sahara Wellness dispensary investigating the pros and cons of cannabis. “It was just a matter of choice,” she explains. “I had a lot of pain and I didn’t want to take hydrocodone for the rest of my life so I was looking for an alternative.”</p>
<p>For Hover, Glusman, and other seniors, education has been key. Dr. Trout offers a new patient orientation class at The+Source each month (the next one is Sunday, August 21) where he estimates that about two-thirds of those in attendance are mature adults or seniors. “There is a lot of misunderstanding and fear so a lot of what I do is just dispelling the misinformation or the fear that they have in their minds because they have been told for so long that it’s a dangerous drug and that it has no medical value. Once we get past that and they get the bulk of information to help them understand how the medicine works and its safety value, they are open to its full potential.”</p>
<p>Another significant part of the senior population seeking information on cannabis is those who are recovering from major surgery. “With the home health component of Valley Center for Cannabis Therapy we are trying to help patients who are recovering from some type of big surgery and don’t want to be zonked out on opioids or worried about addiction,” notes 
Dr. Beckett.</p>

<p>And opiate use should be concerning to seniors. According to the CBS News report, Americans over 65 years of age account for 14 percent of the nation's population, but they use more than 30 percent of all prescription drugs, including some highly-addictive painkillers. </p>
<p>“Overdosing on pharmaceuticals is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. right now and 70 percent of that is due to opiate medications,” explains Dr. Troutt. “If cannabis has the ability to reduce that -- and we are seeing that in research studies like the recent one in JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) which showed states with medical cannabis programs were able to decrease lethal overdose rates of opiate medications by over 25 percent -- than we should welcome it. </p>
<p>“And that’s still just a fraction of the individuals who are using medical cannabis. So just think about when this medicine is absolutely available across the board to patients who want to use this as an alternative without the stigma associated with it, think about what we can do to those lethal overdose numbers from opiate pain medications. It’s truly profound,” enthuses Dr. Troutt.</p>
<p>Another healthcare component being reduced by cannabis is Medicare prescriptions -- new stats show that the federal 
health insurance program for people who are 65 or older is being affected by the legalization of medical cannabis. A pair of researchers from the University of Georgia (UGA) recently published a study in the journal Health Affairs, showing findings that states which had implemented a medical cannabis program had an overall reduction in Medicare program and enrollee spending of nearly $165.2 million per year.</p>
<p>Additionally, the UGA researchers found that, in the 17 states with medical-marijuana laws in place in 2013, prescriptions for painkillers and other classes of drugs fell markedly -- doctors prescribed 1,826 fewer doses of painkillers in a given year -- compared with states that did not have a medical-marijuana law.</p>
<p>Dr. Troutt and his colleague, Matthew D. DiDonato Ph.D., have seen firsthand a reduction in prescription pill use in Arizona, where Dr. Troutt is also licensed. In August 2015, they published a research study in the Journal of Psychoactive Drugs that showed a decrease in the amount of pharmaceuticals patients used. “We followed a group of patients using the dispensary system and one of the main things they reported was decreasing the amount of other pharmaceuticals they were using,” Dr. Troutt reports. </p>
<p>In addition to the Medicare population, another senior-centric area that cannabis will benefit is hospice. “There’s a huge need,” explains Dr. Beckett. “Who in the world is going to benefit from medical marijuana more than a hospice patient? Who has no appetite, who is in constant pain and will spend their last few days dying from all types of things?”</p>
<p>It’s such a huge need that Dr. Beckett was specifically sought out by Omni Care Hospice to become their medical director because they wanted to employ a physician who was open to using cannabis when treating their patients. </p>
<p>Beyond hospice, Dr. Beckett sees a need throughout the entire senior community. In turn, he has started a program called PASS, which stands for Providing Access for Society's Seniors, that is designed to introduce medical cannabis into mainstream healthcare. “We are committed to taking this education to as many hospices, senior living facilities, hospitals, home health companies, and senior organizations that will consider making the lives of those they are trusted to care for as comfortable, as productive, and as dignified as possible.”</p>
<p>With comfortable and productive being optimal -- as anybody on the elderly end of life will tell you. “When I first went in there and talked to her I could barely walk, I was so sick and in so much pain,” Glusman says of her initial visit to Silver Sage Wellness to see the dispensary’s patient consultant Mila. And now? “It’s working. It brought me back to life.” </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>CBD HEALS  BEVY OF CONDITIONS BROUGHT ON BY  ROCK ‘N’ ROLL LIFESTYLE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“On a daily basis this pill has given me more relief than anything else I have ever taken,” explains John Grip of the CBD oil he takes in capsule form. “If I am addicted than I am addicted to hemp oil because it actually makes me feel good in the way that I really feel good. I am not high and I know what it feels like to be high, believe me.”</p>
<p>Grip, 60, who spent close to 40 years in the music business working with legendary icons that include Elvis, knows what it’s like to feel a high brought on by tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis. </p>
<p>“I’m an old fat guy who had a lot of fun. There’s no doubt I have had an amazing life, but with that comes a lifestyle and I am surprised I am still alive. All the years with the rock ‘n’ roll tours -- Aerosmith, Metallica, Rolling Stones, Grateful Dead, Megadeth, Ozzy, it goes on and on -- I have been very fortunate,” he surmises.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Grip’s rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle that contributed to his need for CBD oil. He also suffers with chronic pain from riding the rodeo circuit when he was young. He was a professional rodeo clown for two years and was also certified as a bullfighter.</p>
<p>“I fought 800 bulls to get certified. It’s one of those dumb things you do when you are young. I wasn’t doing that well as a bull rider. I spent more time picking my ass off of the ground than making the eight seconds. I never broke anything, I just got stomped on, dragged, rolled over, thrown, and kicked, among other things.”</p>
<p>After five months of taking CBD oil, Grip is almost completely off of the pain medications he was taking. He took oxycontin, lortab and hydrocodone for a back injury he suffered two-and-a-half years ago when he fell through a roof and landed in the kitchen while installing a refrigeration unit. </p>
<p>“I would have to flip back and forth because your body builds up a resistance and then they don’t work,” Grip says of the opiates he was taking. “I would get up in the morning and couldn’t move my hands, shoulders, and back. I needed surgery on my shoulder. I have full mobility back on that but with the back problems, which they never fixed, I may take a pain pill every two or three days.”</p>
<p>In addition to chronic pain, Grip also found that during the five months he has been taking CBD oil it has had a positive effect on a range of other ailments including high blood pressure, chronic kidney disease, and Type 2 Diabetes. </p>
<p>“I am noticing now that all the time my blood sugar is dropping into the 70 or 60 range and I start getting the shakes and sweats,” explains Grip. He was told to closely monitor his diabetes because patients who use CBD oil “have gone off their diabetic medications. They haven’t needed them anymore because their pancreas starts working again.”</p>
<p>It hasn’t just helped Grip with his medical conditions. “The first night I took the pill I slept nine hours, I haven’t slept nine hours since the ‘80s. I woke up and couldn’t believe it -- I thought maybe my wife had changed the clocks. I am sleeping like I never slept before. I don’t hurt like I used to. I started to notice all these other things starting to decline and I thought, ‘Holy shit, this is like a one-stop shop’.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>FROM BLUE TO GREEN  LIFE BEYOND THE BADGE INCLUDES  CANNABIS FOR RETIRED OFFICERS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>People have entered the medical cannabis industry from a variety of other professions. We’ve seen doctors, lawyers, firefighters, restaurateurs and police. That last one may come as a surprise, but Dave Kallas and James Green, both former law enforcement officers turned dispensary entrepreneurs see no conflicts between their past and present professions.</p>
<p>“The very first couple months, year, people were really surprised,” to find former police officers involved in the business, says Green. “Now when I tell people I’m involved with it, they kind of say ‘good.’ After all, who would you want in this type of business? Somebody who has twenty-something years of experience in a trusted position in the community or somebody who you don’t know at all and you have no knowledge of their background or trustworthiness?”</p>
<p> Now working with NevadaPURE, Green went on a police ride-along when he was a teenager and, as he recalls, “it was love at first drive.” He joined the Henderson Police Force in 1993, working in homeland security, the investigations division and serving as watch commander during his 21-year career.</p>

<p>Dave Kallas of the Apothecarium dispensary was an officer with Las Vegas Metro for three decades, starting in 1979 when, he laughs, “things were very different in Las Vegas.” He worked a variety of assignments, from patrol units to street narcotics to the intelligence section of the department’s organized crime bureau.</p>
<p>Like a number of other members in the medical cannabis industry, Kallas came to it through personal experience. In 2006, “I had a bone graft done on my right tibia,” he explains, “when they made the incision, they discovered that I had contracted this infection that there’s no cure for, Valley Fever.” And so Kallas was “put on the standard pain medication train—or roller coaster, if you want to call it that,” a situation many people find themselves in, but one he definitely wasn’t okay with.</p>
<p> “I got very frustrated. I said, ‘I don’t want to be one of those people who goes through the lowest level of pain medication, like a lortab and ends up with an oxycontin problem’,” Kallas recalls. A friend, State Senator Tick Segerblom, encouraged him to look into medical marijuana—“He knew the condition I was going through and he said, ‘Dave, you should do some research on this. This really could be much better for you than what you’re currently taking for your pain’.” After studying up on cannabis, visiting sites and talking to people in the industry, Kallas began working with a team to open a dispensary in Nevada. “I was hoping that getting involved and having my own place in some way would help me with the condition that I was dealing with.”</p>
<p> James Green initially had his doubts about medical marijuana, many of them related to how he thought it would affect policing in Southern Nevada. “In 2001, once medical passed and it became legal to grow, possess, consume it—I thought the sky was gonna fall. I thought how we do law enforcement was going to change dramatically,” he recalls. “Thankfully, I was completely wrong.”</p>
<p>The law enforcement background both men bring to their respective businesses is reassuring to regulators and customers. “We follow the rules, we’re going to have compliance, we’re going to sell it to the right people under the right circumstances,” says Green. Kallas also says that fears of criminal involvement in the industry are unfounded, thanks to both regulation and personnel. “I’ve been a cop 30 years,” he states, “No cartel is going to come into a business that I’m associated with.”</p>

<p>As former policemen, both Kallas and Green have a more personal, practical take on marijuana’s impact on law enforcement. “I’ve never come across a combative individual who’s been sitting around smoking marijuana, but I’ve certainly come across lots of them who have been drinking all day,” says Kallas. “I would rather go to a call where the guy has been smoking marijuana—I figure he’s probably going to be mellow. You tell me I’m going to a call for these guys at a family party, they’ve been drinking all day—send as many units as you can!”</p>
<p> Green agrees: “I ask officers, ‘When was the last time you went to a violent crime that was marijuana related?’ You can’t get an answer from anybody because they can’t remember one. ‘When was the last time you went to a domestic call where people were under the influence of marijuana and nothing else?’ They say ‘I can’t recall one’.”</p>
<p>And how has medical marijuana impacted law enforcement and crime in our communities? Green has asked them about that too. “And the answer is: It hasn’t. It’s a blip on their radar—officers are aware where the dispensaries and cultivation facilities are, but that’s about it. I’ve gotten zero reports of crime associated with medical marijuana since the program has 
come out.”</p>
<p> One of Kallas’ chief concerns is navigating the industry’s many rules, regulations and requirements, which he fears could trip up the industry just as it’s taking off. “Putting in too many roadblocks makes it cost-prohibitive,” he points out. “In some cases I think the laws are very restrictive and people who have invested millions of dollars in this start-up business are going to lose out because there’s just not enough business for them right now to survive,” he explains. “That’s not what the law was intended to do. The law was intended to give people the opportunity to open these dispensaries so they could supply medicinal marijuana to the patients that need it.”</p>
<p>Where do Kallas and Green see the future of the cannabis industry? Well, that depends on whether Question 2 passes in November. Green is optimistic that the recent changing attitudes toward cannabis will power a yes vote. “People are turning the tide and I agree with it. I think in 5-10 years marijuana will be an afterthought, a normal part of our society. I do think it is a much safer alternative than some of the other things out there in our community. It’ll add value economically,” he says, adding that, “If anybody should have recreational marijuana in this country, I would say Las Vegas or Nevada would be the first place.”</p>
<p> Kallas also supports Question 2, although he says he won’t take any profit from the Apothecarium’s involvement in recreational sales. “I’ll still participate in the medicinal,” he explains, “It just creates too much of an ethical issue for me—but that doesn’t mean I don’t believe that it’s better for people than alcohol is.” He hopes that the ballot question passes and the 2017 legislature does a little finessing. “They can’t change the language that’s in the ballot question but they can certainly add language,” he says “I believe that if they regulate it properly it will be beneficial.” But he agrees that the time for cannabis has come. He says it make take 10 or  20 years, but “I really believe that, if done right, you’ll see marijuana grow as probably the number one consumed product in the state—above alcohol eventually.”</p>
<p> Ultimately, Dave Kallas and James Green see no inconsistency between their law enforcement experience and their participation in the cannabis industry, as the issues that might have caused conflict have been found to be largely imaginary. “There’s not a history of marijuana being a problem from a public safety perspective,” says Green. “We were told for many, many decades that there’s a war on drugs. From my perspective the war on drugs has failed and we need to decriminalize, legalize it, regulate it, tax it. It’s here. It’s not going away."</p>]]></content:encoded>

There’s not a tastier way to Celebrate National Peach Month than with a quick and easy peach crisp. The nutritional benefits of the juicy fruit are peachy keen. Encased in a velvet skin, peaches are packed with potassium which can help reduce anxiety and hair loss as well as prevent muscle weakness and poor memory. In addition, peaches are loaded with fiber, which can help prevent colon cancer and lower cholesterol levels. Rich in vitamin A and C, peaches boost the immune system and make a great natural moisturizer, which is probably where the term “peaches and cream complexion” comes from. Enjoy!

		<title>AN ELIXIR FOR THE ELDERLY</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Dr. Timothy Beckett</h4>
<p>Due to the increasing advances in medicine and robust public health efforts, the elderly population has seen a steady increase 
in growth over the past several years. However, advancing age can be coupled with many medical conditions, which may not only be detrimental to a person’s quality of life, but can place financial strain on the individual, their family, and the US economy as a whole.</p>
<p>Knowing this, greater emphasis must be placed on making sure our seniors go into their later years in a healthy, comfortable, and dignified manner. Medical cannabis, when added to a lifestyle of exercise and proper dietary intake, may provide the biological foundation needed for a long, healthy life free of pain and other co-morbidities that haunt our aging population.</p>
<p>Medical cannabis, or medical marijuana as it is so often referred to, has been shown to be effective in improving not only the symptoms of certain medical conditions, but the medical conditions themselves. Some of the more common medical conditions that our elderly population face include cancer, glaucoma, incontinence, hypertension, diabetes, insomnia, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and pain from conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and degenerative disc disease affecting the spine.</p>
<p>The use of cannabis has to some extent been effective in preventing, delaying the onset and progression, and even eliminating these conditions altogether. In turn, the medical community must focus on educating the elderly about cannabis treatment and its benefits, as well as the process by which they can become a recipient of such innovative therapy.</p>
<p>Cancer of many different types, including lung, breast, colon, and brain cancers, can all be found in the aging patient, likely due to the inability of the immune system to mount an effective response against damaged and mutated cancer cells. Additionally, many of the contemporary therapies used to treat the patient often leave them in a weakened state, allowing for diseases of opportunism to rear their ugly heads. And let’s not forget about poor appetite, nausea, vomiting, and general wasting of the physical body, which so often accompany cancer and its treatment.</p>
<p>Data suggests that CBD (cannabidiol), one of the major active components of medical cannabis, can inhibit cancer cell growth, thereby decreasing tumor size and reducing the chances that it could spread elsewhere in the body. While undergoing chemotherapy or radiation, or even after undergoing surgery for such illnesses, the use of medical cannabis can reduce the associated nausea, vomiting, and physical wasting that often accompany such treatments.</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s disease is progressive mental deterioration that can occur with age, due to generalized degeneration of the brain. This disease can literally take a person’s intelligence and memories hostage. I remember marveling at my grandfather’s knowledge and wisdom as I was growing up. This well read man served as Assistant Superintendent for the Dallas Independent School District and was the principal at many of its high schools. He read every book he could get his hands on, and was quick to share his knowledge by teaching. However, the most profound memory I have of his final years involved his frustrations at not remembering how to drive to a place that he had driven to perhaps thousands of times in his life, and the sadness on my grandmother’s face when he was unable to recall his wife's name of 52 years. </p>
<p>Much study and many resources have been aimed at discovering preventative measures or cures for Alzheimer’s. Just recently, researchers at the Salk Institute found preliminary evidence that THC and other compounds found in marijuana can promote the cellular removal of the toxic proteins found in the brain that are associated with Alzheimer’s. This news is quite promising, and could lead to treatments with the potential to save the lives of the more than 5 million Americans each year who are afflicted with the disease.</p>
<p>Chronic pain is a tremendous public health problem, affecting upwards of 100 million Americans annually, many of them being seniors. Annual costs associated with chronic pain diagnosis and treatment can exceed $600 billion a year. And although pain may accompany many chronic illnesses associated with aging, it does not have to be a normal part of aging.</p>
<p>Many treatments directed at treating pain are ineffective, and most oral pain medications, opioids in particular, carry a high risk of abuse, addiction, and even overdose. To make matters worse, many of the current medicinal therapies to assist people who have become addicted to oxycontin, morphine, lortab, vicodin, and other opioid medications carry their own risks of abuse and overdose. </p>
<p>Medical cannabis has been found to be effective in treating patients with pain. First, the anti-inflammatory properties can often prevent the destructive processes which resulted in the pain in the first place, such as arthritis and degenerative disk disease. </p>
<p>Secondly, nerves that detect pain contain abundant receptors for cannabinoids which, when activated, result in blockade of pain perception. Combine this information with all of the anecdotal evidence of decreased neuropathic pain in many individuals using medical cannabis, and it is easy to see its effectiveness in treating pain. </p>
<p>Ideally, one could potentially use medical cannabis to both treat a person’s pain and aid them in decreasing or eliminating their opioid consumption. So, it may be safe to say that cannabis can be used to prevent opioid abuse and potential overdose of patients using opioids, and it could be used as a viable alternative in treating pain when detoxing a patient addicted to opioids.</p>
<p>There are so many medical conditions that cannabis has been shown to potentially treat. Whether still independent, requiring home health assistance, living out their final months with family or under hospice care, our aging population deserves to have every possible option at their disposal to lead a healthy, dignified, and comfortable life. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many times the states serve as laboratories for new programs and ideas. They are the pioneers of new industries, undergoing trial and error to see what works and what doesn’t before they are instituted on a massive federal level. There are 25 such laboratories in the United States incubating their own fledging medical marijuana programs. Colorado, one of four states with both medical and adult use marijuana programs, is one of the states with the most experience shaping a regulatory framework for cannabis. In late June, a contingent of Nevada legislators, state officials, and industry experts traveled to Colorado to find out what lessons their counterparts had learned over the last few years as they explored and navigated the wild west of cannabis. </p>
<p>“Colorado went through many growing pains with respect to their medical and retail marijuana programs,” offered Joe Pollock, Deputy Administrator of Regulatory and Planning Services for the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health, which administers Nevada’s medical marijuana program. “Open communication with our counterparts in Colorado will provide invaluable insight which will expedite Nevada’s ability to implement a safe and successful marijuana program for its citizens and visitors.”</p>
<p>Meetings during the two-day trip to Denver included discussions with representatives of the Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment as well as the Colorado Division of Revenue to address marijuana industry do's and don't's, the tax structure of medical versus adult use, economic impact, public health and safety costs and best practices as well as 
DUI laws.</p>
<p>“In some respects, Nevada has already found a more successful way to implement its marijuana industry. However, we would be remiss if we did not take the time to look at Colorado’s successes and failures so that we can adopt what they did right and avoid their missteps,” said attorney Riana Durrett, who is Executive Director of the Nevada Dispensary Association, and made the trip to Denver.</p>

<h3>Reining in Edibles </h3>
<p>One of Colorado’s biggest challenges has been with edibles. Cannabis-infused food has caused officials in Colorado quite a bit of grief due to lack of education surrounding overconsumption and their popularity with novices. According to Marijuana Policy Group, in Colorado edibles are responsible for 15 percent of adult use sales and make up about 6 percent of medical sales.</p>
<p>“The state had no regulations on serving sizes for edibles and as a result had products that had an extremely high amount of THC,” explained Nevada Assemblyman Derek Armstrong, chairman of Assembly Taxation. </p>
<p>To fix the situation and implement better patient safety measures, “Colorado has created a serving size and now requires that edibles be sold in separate servings, giving patients the ability to know how much THC they will be consuming,” said Assemblyman Armstrong.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the Nevada contingent believes getting ahead of the edible situation before it becomes a problem is the best route for the state to take. “It is much better for the industry to self-regulate edibles and serving sizes than to have individuals over-consume and then the government have to impose strict limitations,” offered attorney Amanda Connor of Connor & Connor. “If the industry works within the regulations and works with the government, a safe and effective market will develop which will generate revenue for Nevada's education system.” </p>

<h3>Governing Caregivers</h3>
<p>Another headache Colorado’s legislators have endured involves regulating the state’s caregivers. Colorado allows caregivers to grow marijuana for multiple patients with a limit of 99 plants per patient. </p>
<p>“Colorado’s caregiver rules have led to something they call a “gray market.” Caregivers can seek approval for up to 99 plants and are joining with other caregivers and operating in an unregulated system that is potentially dangerous for patients,” explained Assemblyman Armstrong. “Nevada needs to ensure that we do not create a gray market.”</p>
<p>Even though Nevada currently allows one patient per caregiver and limits cultivation of marijuana by a resident to 12 plants, Nevada officials are definitely cognizant of the issue and the unforeseen challenges it can present. “The increase in organized crime activity in Colorado is very concerning and seems to be directly attributed to the ability to obtain approval to grow 99 plants per patient (if prescribed by a physician). Law enforcement officials are having a hard time differentiating legitimate growers and those immersed in illegal activity,” said Pollock. </p>
<p>“The Colorado representatives cautioned against allowing for an unregulated caregiver market. Fortunately, I think Nevada is ahead of the curve on that one because our limit on possession of plants is lower than Colorado's,” said Durrett.</p>
<p>There is also the issue of the caregivers’ plants not being lab tested. “Colorado has an extensive caregiver market that serves many patients but is not regulated or tested product. I would highly recommend that all product, especially medical product, be tested to ensure it is safe for patient consumption,” said Connor.</p>
<h3>New Territories for Education</h3>
<p>The state of Colorado has used the additional revenue from cannabis to fund statewide educational programs. “I was very impressed with the fact that Colorado is putting the already-mandated tax revenue into use to improve public awareness and drug treatment. The tax revenue is already mandated in the ballot initiative itself so no tax increases are required,” said Durrett. “Colorado appears to be taking this opportunity to improve public education, public awareness, and drug treatment programs in a manner that goes above and beyond the impacts of marijuana legalization by using the windfall of taxes to improve problems that existed long before marijuana legalization.” </p>
<p>One educational program funded with Colorado’s cannabis tax money is called the Marijuana Education Initiative, which teaches teens about the effects of cannabis on the brain so they can make more informed choices. According to its website, the Marijuana Education Initiative was established as a progressive, research-based prevention and intervention program that provides curricula and services to promote an informed understanding of the impact of youth and adolescent marijuana use. </p>
<p>Agreeing that there is plenty to learn from Colorado’s educational initiatives, Assemblyman Armstrong referenced another program the state has implemented that he thinks has merit. “One idea is to start an education campaign as soon as possible such as Colorado’s 'Good to Know' campaign," which can be found at goodtoknowcolorado.com. Implemented by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, it offers information on topics that include health basics, marijuana 101, tourist information, pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, and safety tips. </p>
<p>State employees in charge of implementing cannabis programs for Nevada are already on board. “Should Question 2 pass, the Division of Public and Behavioral Health will look to mimic Colorado’s public outreach programs to include education on safe marijuana use, education of Nevada’s youth to the dangers of marijuana and how it effects brain development, and a program to address marijuana addiction,” offered Pollock. </p>
<p>“Nevada needs to get prepared because implementing an entirely new industry is not something that happens on its own. The industry and governmental officials need to communicate and decide early how taxes will be collected, how public health can be improved by the increased tax revenue, and how to maintain public safety,” concluded Durrett.</p>

		<title>KNOW YOUR RIGHTS: CHILD CUSTODY,  CANNABIS, AND THE COURTS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For most parents, the thought of losing the ability to spend time with their child is their worst nightmare. Unfortunately, due to the current state of marijuana laws, many parents’ worst nightmare has become a stark reality. In spite of recent reforms to many of the jurisdiction’s cannabis laws, medical marijuana patients and recreational users are having their children taken away from them through criminal actions and civil child custody proceedings. Parents who choose to use cannabis need to be aware of the potential legal issues they could face.</p>
<h3>Criminal Issues</h3>
<p>I always remind marijuana users that the possession, use, production, and distribution of cannabis remains prohibited under federal law. If you use marijuana, for any reason, you could face serious consequences under the laws of the federal government and the laws of several other jurisdictions. Nevertheless, the most likely crime that parents who use marijuana could face in relation to their children is the crime of child endangerment. In Nevada, child endangerment occurs when a person knowingly places a child in a situation where the child may suffer physical or mental harm (NRS 200.508). Depending on the circumstances, child endangerment could result in either felony or misdemeanor charges. </p>
<p>One common situation in which cannabis users may find themselves charged with child endangerment stems from Nevada’s strict marijuana DUI laws. Marijuana patients need to understand that in Nevada you can be charged with DUI even if you are not actually impaired at the time you are driving -- simply because you have greater than an arbitrary amount of marijuana or marijuana metabolites in your body.</p>
<p>If children are in the car at the time a patient is arrested for suspicion of DUI, they could also be charged with child endangerment. Pursuant to Nevada law, the Court will consider having a passenger under the age of 15 at the time of a DUI arrest as an aggravating factor pursuant to NRS 484C.400. </p>
<p>Possessing a marijuana patient card is NOT a defense to a marijuana DUI or a charge of child endangerment. If you are charged with child endangerment, the authorities could remove your children from your home and you will have to fight to get them back. Parents who use marijuana could also face child endangerment charges if they are found to be in violation of Nevada’s medical marijuana laws, such as possessing greater than the permitted amount or selling marijuana in violation of the law, while in the presence of their children. Parents should take the time to familiarize themselves with Nevada’s marijuana laws and make sure they strictly adhere to them. </p>
<p>Parents who use marijuana should store their medicine in a securely locked location. In order to prevent accidental ingestion, parents should take special care to ensure that edibles are stored and locked away where children cannot gain access to them. Failure to secure your medicine properly could lead to charges of child endangerment, or worse, if your child or their friends are able to access your marijuana. Use common sense and be sure to store your marijuana where nobody else can access it. </p>
<h3>Defining Driving While Impaired</h3>
<p>If a person cannot safely drive a motor vehicle due to the use of marijuana, or other drugs, they may be charged with a DUI. To be charged with driving while impaired, the arresting officer will look at the totality of the circumstances to determine if the drug/substance rendered the driver incapable of driving safely. The officer often determines your level of impairment through field sobriety tests (FST). Most people do not realize that a FST is optional and can be refused. Regardless, if you are found to be impaired to a degree that prevents you from operating your vehicle safely, you may be arrested and charged with DUI.</p>
<h3>Child Custody Issues</h3>
<p>Divorce and child custody cases can be some of the most bitterly fought court battles. In highly volatile cases where one parent is a marijuana patient and the other isn’t, it is common for the non-patient parent to use the other parent’s marijuana use as leverage in court. Angry exes, often acting on the advice of their divorce lawyer, may ask the court to order the marijuana patient to undergo drug testing, which can lead to the patient’s custody being revoked or being ordered to supervised visits only. </p>
<p>It is also common for divorce lawyers to request that the court place certain conditions on the marijuana-using parent, such as banning the parent from driving with the children (due to Nevada’s marijuana DUI law discussed above) or from using their medicine while the child is present in their home. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, some family court judges have been more than willing to impose such restrictions and other harsh measures on legal marijuana patients. Marijuana patients in family court are left with few options other than hiring an experienced family court lawyer to handle their case, which can get very expensive very quickly. I do not recommend attempting to proceed in family court without an experienced attorney, especially if the other party has already retained a lawyer. </p>
<h3>The More You Know</h3>
<p>Given the current state of marijuana laws, there is nothing a marijuana patient can do to completely protect themselves from marijuana charges. However, being informed of the law may keep you from ending up in trouble in the first place. </p>
<p>Parents who choose to use marijuana should never drive while using their medicine, especially with minors in their vehicle. Parents should also ensure that they store their medicine in a secure location where children cannot gain access to it. Parents with questions about their cannabis use should take the time to consult with an experienced attorney in order to understand their rights, especially if they are facing criminal charges or a contentious child custody battle. </p>
<p>No parent should lose their kids just because they use marijuana. All marijuana-using patients should contact their elected representatives and continue to push for the reform of marijuana laws. Until we have a change at a federal level, parents other patients will continue to suffer under our current legal system. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<strong>Super Food Veggie Burger with Hemp Seed
</strong>

<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
1 cup cooked steel cut oats
1 cup walnuts 
1/2 Tbsp avocado oil, plus more for cooking
1/2 white onion, finely chopped
1 cup sliced mushrooms
1/4 cup hemp seeds
1 Tbsp each chili powder, cumin powder, and smoked paprika
1/2 tsp each sea salt and black pepper 
1-1/2 cups cooked black beans
1/2 cup chickpea flour 
4 Tbsp vegan BBQ sauce


<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>Cook steel cut oats in 3 cups of water for 20 minutes until soft and sticky. </p>
<p>Heat skillet over medium heat and once hot, add raw walnuts and spices and toast for 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until fragrant and golden brown. Let cool and move onto the next step.</p>
<p>In the meantime, heat the same skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add 1/2 Tbsp oil and onion and sauté till soft then add mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking till mushrooms are nicely browned. Remove from heat and set aside. Once walnuts are cooled, add to blender or food processor and blend until a fine meal, set aside.</p>
<p>To a large mixing bowl, add drained, dried black beans and mash well with a fork, leaving only a few whole beans.</p>
<p>Next add hemp seeds, cooked steel oats, spice-walnut mixture, sautéed onion and mushrooms, chickpea flour and barbeque sauce -- mix thoroughly with a wooden spoon for 1-2 minutes, or until a moldable dough forms. If dry, add extra 1-2 Tbsp barbeque sauce. If too wet, add more chickpea flour. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.</p>
<p>For larger burgers, divide into 5 patties (1/2 cup in size), or form 10 smaller burgers (1/4 cup in size). To help form the patties, line your 1/2 or 1/4 measuring cup with plastic wrap and pack with burger mixture. Press down to pack firmly, then lift out using the plastic wrap’s edge, and slightly flatten with hands to form a 3/4-inch thick patty. Set on a baking sheet or plate for grilling.</p>
<p>If grilling, heat the grill and brush the grill surface with oil to ease cooking. Otherwise, heat the same skillet you used earlier to medium heat.</p>
<p>Once skillet is hot, add just enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of your skillet, then add your burgers -- only as many as will comfortably fit in the pan. Otherwise, add burgers to the grill and close lid.</p>
<p>Cook for 3-4 minutes or until well browned on the underside, then flip gently. They aren't as firm as meat burgers, but will definitely hold their shape. Reduce heat if cooking/browning too quickly. Cook for 3-4 minutes on other side.</p>
<p>Remove burgers from heat to let cool slightly, and prepare any other toppings/sides at this time (such as grilling/toasting your buns). Serve burgers as is, or on toasted buns with desired toppings. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Dr. Dustin Sulak never intended to make cannabis the focus of his medical practice and career. Opening his practice in 2009 just happened to coincidentally coincide with the expansion of Maine’s patient program. He was “in the right place at the right time and was forced to learn very quickly how to use cannabis as a medicine.” In addition to growing his private practice to three clinics with ten providers and nearly 20,000 patients over the last seven years, Dr. Sulak has been sharing his cannabis knowledge with the world at healer.com.

In what capacity did you first get involved with cannabis?  
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">

When I was in undergrad in Bloomington, Indiana, I was involved in a group called the Citizens Alliance for the Legalization of Marijuana, it was a student group that I became the president of. I learned about the value of education and how to get the message out. At that time I didn’t realize the medical value of cannabis, I was more focused on the economic, industrial and spiritual value. Later in medical school I did a rotation with an endocannabinoid researcher and that really opened my eyes to cannabinoid physiology and what great potential we have to relieve suffering and improve health using cannabis and understanding the endocannabinoid system.

Why did you start treating patients with cannabis? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Following medical school, I came to Maine and did my postgraduate training and when I opened a private practice in 2009 I was really the only physician in the state accepting new patients for medical cannabis. I never intended for cannabis to be my career. I opened a practice to focus on integrated medicine and osteopathic manipulation but I certified one patient for cannabis and then another and very quickly I had hundreds of patients on a waiting list to be seen as soon as possible. 
The year I opened my practice (2009) was the same year the law expanded in Maine to include chronic pain and it allowed the licensing of dispensaries, it allowed a caregiver model. It was a major expansion of the cannabis program and I was in the right place at the right time and really was forced to learn very quickly how to use cannabis as a medicine.

Were you one of the first doctors in Maine to treat patients with cannabis?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I wasn’t the first, but I was one of the first. I have always been and continue to be on the leading edge of the clinical use of cannabis by looking at specific dosing recommendations and different delivery methods and different approaches for people with various conditions. There has been a real shift, when I first started it was mostly me listening to people about how much they were smoking and what benefits they were having. But now it’s people who have no clue about cannabis, many of whom have never tried it before or have only used it recreationally but not for health, and they come in and want specific recommendations on what’s going to work best for them.

<div class="panel-body">

I work with about 10 other medical providers in two locations in Maine, we have grown very rapidly from a private practice to two clinics in Maine and we have a sister practice in Massachusetts. Among a dozen of us we take care of close to 20,000 patients who are all mostly using cannabis as a treatment. We have a few who come to us for other reasons. I see cannabis as a gateway to integrative medicine. We are unlike a lot of cannabis clinics out there, we just don’t do the certificate. We do real medical work here, we do longer visits, we give recommendations for improving health or treating the condition beyond cannabis and certainly beyond what our patients expect. They continue to follow up with us as part of their regular care. We have always offered other services like manipulation, acupuncture, hormone replacement, therapeutic laser for pain – all the things our patient population needs.

Absolutely, to the point where people are coming in, not even knowing that it’s called marijuana that they are interested in and have heard about. We have had patients come in who have heard about their neighbor using a green salve on their arthritis and they kind of know that maybe it’s cannabis but they aren’t sure. It’s getting out there into the senior community that there is something that’s safer and more effective. The other patients I am spending a lot of time with are the pediatric cases and most of them have very severe neurologic conditions, seizures, brain and spinal cord injuries.

We realized all the time and energy we were putting into educating each patient in our clinics would be valuable to people all over the world. That’s when I made healer.com which is a patient education website and it takes all the content we found we needed to save time and energy in the clinic and made it available to people everywhere. We have many different programs, there’s one on there for people who are brand-new to cannabis, and there’s also a program for people who are using too much and want to make their system more sensitive to it. There’s also a program to switch from smoking to using liquid medicines like tinctures. It’s all the things we have found most useful in the clinic.

What has been your most fascinating cannabis discovery to date? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

THC-A in tiny doses can be effective for treating seizures and other conditions. We started a testing lab here in Maine because no one else was doing it. Once I started getting more and more pediatric patients I really needed to know how many milligrams of cannabinoids they were using for them to get a consistent dosage from one batch to the next. Probably 2-1/2 years ago, after starting the testing lab, we had a patient come in saying this CBD tincture was working for seizures, so we were curious to see how many milligrams of CBD she was getting and decided to test it. We tested it and it had no CBD in it and almost no THC in it, it was almost all THC-A and not a lot of it. She was having a seizure reduction with a relatively low dose so then I started realizing there is something anti-convulsive about THC-A. There’s very little on it in the literature. Just one study from the late ‘70s that tried it out on rodents at very high doses and found it effective but since that time we have been using THC-A not only for seizures, but also other neurologic conditions and sometimes we are seeing efficacy at doses that are less than a milligram a day for some children. In some of these cases a higher dose of THC-A is not effective while a lower dose is. So I really think we are on the tip of the iceberg of how THC-A works, we know that it works very differently than THC but it hasn’t been investigated very deeply yet. It’s just one of these discoveries that is very exciting with a lot of potential.

What could cannabis do for prevention of disease? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I actually gave a whole presentation on this. The strongest evidence is for traumatic brain injury and stroke; there’s a huge amount of evidence that shows even very low dose cannabinoids in the bloodstream protects people from head injury and stroke. This year alone there’s been a handful of good studies that have looked at humans and compared their outcomes…say you get a brain injury and you go to a hospital and your blood or urine has THC in it or it doesn’t and they look at those two groups, the THC group tends to do much better. The same is true to some extent with heart attacks. There’s another study out this year that shows people with THC in their system were less likely to die and less likely to have intervention and more likely to have a shorter hospital stay than those who didn’t. Cannabis is also helping with some of the leading causes of death and morbidity in our country: heart attack, stroke, diabetes and obesity. People who use cannabis are less likely to be obese and less likely to have diabetes. There’s not a lot evidence on cancer reduction but I think the most powerful finding is a study in California that showed a 45 percent reduction in bladder cancer incidence in cannabis users compared to non-cannabis users. That’s the fifth most common type of cancer so that’s not a small statistic.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

We are right at the beginning of that now. Brown University has a class, University of Vermont is starting to teach it, not in its medical school but as a regular course. I have had the opportunity to present it at University of New England as an extracurricular, not as a mainstream course. It’s ludicrous that it is not part of every physiology course. It will get there, it’s not really new information anymore, it has been around for a couple of decades. In the last ten years, we have had a very clear understanding that the endocannabinoid system is part of the physiology of healing, that it is widespread throughout the body and that it is essential for us to be healthy. But to put it in perspective, most medical schools still don’t teach a nutrition course.

</div>
<div id="collapseTen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I have the opportunity to speak to both the medical community and also the public quite often. Especially when I am speaking to the medical community, I get a pretty good sense of when people go into that emotionally reactive defensive mode upon hearing about cannabis. The percentage of the room that has that reaction has been decreasing over the last five years significantly. Now there are providers that are recognizing they have a knowledge deficit and even though they don’t want to recommend cannabis in their practice, they are coming to lectures and conferences to learn more because they see this as a new field in medicine that’s valid. I have spoken in some mainstream settings like the Lahey Clinic and Mass General Hospital and the clinicians there are very receptive to me so that tells me we are going in the right direction within my professional community, and I believe the rest of the public is in that same boat.

When do you see the stigma surrounding cannabis disappearing? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEleven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I believe that 10 years from now there will be close to 100 percent acceptance of cannabis but I am used to stigma. There’s a lot of natural medicines beyond cannabis that are very effective and natural approaches to healthcare like ‘mind body medicine.’ I think that’s a great example because 10 years ago, the idea of prescribing meditation was very new and very controversial and now mainstream medical conferences often feature a meditation course so a physician can be more resilient to burnout. There’s a lot of data that shows meditation decreases inflammation and improves immune function and quality of life. I am used to seeing this trend where there are these healthcare interventions that have been around for centuries or millennia with a proven track record. Watching that unfold into mainstream medical acceptance is really exciting.

How does the pharmaceutical industry view cannabis as a medicine?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwelve" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Sadly the bulk of the education that doctors receive after and, to some extent, in medical school is sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. Cannabis education is going to be coming from the pharmaceutical industry before we know it because they are getting involved as well. We are going to be seeing more and more cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical products. The first will be GW Pharmaceuticals’ Sativex which will likely be in US markets in the next few years. They will be doing education outreach for doctors. We will continue to see other cannabinoid based medicines being promoted by the pharmaceutical industry and when they do that, it’s going to require clinicians to be aware of cannabinoid physiology and to understand the basic dosing of cannabis based medicines. We already have marinol (synthetic cannabis). There are certain sectors where doctors do understand and recognize it such as oncology and hospice and the awareness is growing there. I think that’s going to contribute to the medical community becoming more accepting. Sadly the bulk of the education that doctors receive after and, to some extent, in medical school is sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry. Cannabis education is going to be coming from the pharmaceutical industry before we know it because they are getting involved as well. We are going to be seeing more and more cannabinoid-based pharmaceutical products. The first will be GW Pharmaceuticals’ Sativex which will likely be in US markets in the next few years.

Standardized doses and reproducible medicines. Patients knowing what they are getting and being able to get the same things next month if it’s working for them. We have seen people have real life challenges due to the inability to access the right medicine consistently. Another major direction is low-dose cannabis. I have been somewhat of a pioneer in low-dose cannabis not just THC-A, but other approaches that have better results and less side effects and I think that trend will continue. People are recognizing that they can actually use less and that less is more in a lot of situations. Cannabis for health and disease prevention is a big new direction that I’m excited for cannabis to take because it’s not just useful for people who are sick. It’s useful for those of who are healthy to stay healthy.

		<title>Your right to grow cannabis at home</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although the passage of the law permitting the use of medical marijuana in Nevada has provided some clarity and public awareness with regard to who can grow cannabis and how much they can grow, the law can still be confusing. Most importantly, it’s key that potential patients and growers know their rights when it comes to growing medical marijuana in the state, especially given the ways in which the law may change in the future. </p>
<h3 class="page-header">Growing Your Own Medical Cannabis</h3>
<p>The current Nevada Revised Statute (“NRS”), 453A.200, allows medical marijuana patients and caregivers to possess, deliver, and produce certain amounts of cannabis. However, the law does not allow patients to grow marijuana unless certain conditions are met. Patients would be well advised to note that these conditions may change after April 1, 2018. Before this date, a patient can be “grandfathered” into being permitted to grow marijuana (by having obtained a patient card prior to July 1, 2013) or they can meet one of the following compassionate care exceptions: </p>

        <ul style="margin-left:40px">
          <li>Exception 1: A patient may be permitted to grow their
          own cannabis if all of the medical marijuana
          dispensaries in the county of residence of the person
          who holds the patient card are unable to supply 
            the quantity or strain of marijuana necessary 
            for treatment of that person’s medical condition.</li>
          <li>Exception 2: A patient may be permitted to grow
          marijuana due to illness or lack of transportation. One
          example being if the person who holds the patient card
          is unable to travel to a medical marijuana dispensary.</li>
          <li>Exception 3: No medical marijuana dispensary is
          operating within 25 miles of the residence of the person
          who holds the patient card at the time the person first
          applied for his or her patient card.</li>
        </ul>
<p>The first exception—whether a medical marijuana dispensary carries the correct strain for a patient—could present interesting issues going forward.  Who will enforce this provision? Will scientific evidence be presented and who would require such proof that strains grown at home are different from those sold in a dispensary? While the second and third exceptions are fairly self-explanatory, it is important to note that the burden will be on the patient to establish that he or she fits within the exception. 
</p>
<h3 class="page-header">Limits on Home Grows</h3>
<p>It is important to note that regardless of whether or not a patient grows or purchases their medicine, all patients are bound by the same limits on possession of plants and usable marijuana. Under NRS 453A.200, each patient may possess 2.5 ounces of usable marijuana (or equivalent in edibles) and 12 plants (mature or immature). The language in Nevada’s Revised Statutes states that each person cannot collectively possess more than 12 plants and 2.5 ounces with another person. This leaves rooms for questions such as -- what does “collectively possess” mean? </p>
<p>Further, the law requires that each patient must ensure that the usable marijuana or marijuana plants are “safeguarded in an enclosed, secure location.”</p>
<p>Educated and well-informed patients are best able to take advantage of the benefits that Nevada’s flourishing medical marijuana industry has to offer. If you’re a patient or a caregiver who finds yourself an exception to the rule when it comes to growing cannabis in Nevada, it’s a good idea to go over your options to be sure that your medicine can be obtained legally and thoughtfully, before and after April 1, 2018. </p>

<h2>ARIZONA</h2>
On June 30, the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol (CRMLA) submitted 258,582 signatures to state officials in order to place an initiative to tax and regulate marijuana on the November ballot. Their submission exceeded the required number of 150,642 signatures. The ballot initiative would “allow adults 21 and older to possess limited amounts of marijuana; establish a system in which marijuana is regulated similarly to alcohol; and enact a 15 percent tax on retail marijuana sales, from which a majority of the revenue would be directed to Arizona schools and public education programs.” The submission was presented a day after the Joint Legislative Budget Committee announced findings that the initiative would generate around $82 million a year in tax revenue, at least $55 million of which will go to K-12 education.

<h2>MINNESOTA</h2>
The state of Minnesota implemented its medical marijuana program in 2015 with a list of nine qualifying conditions, which allowed smoke-free forms of the substance to be consumed by those with doctors’ recommendations, but incurable pain was not one of the conditions. Starting in July, patients with incurable pain were allowed to register for Minnesota’s medical marijuana program with their doctor’s recommendation. During the last month, approximately 500 patients have registered as medical marijuana patients, which is more than five times the number of patients who registered when the program launched last year. Patients with intractable pain began legally purchasing the medicine on August 1.

<h2>ARKANSAS</h2>
In July, the Arkansas Secretary of State announced that Arkansans for Compassionate Care’s medical marijuana initiative qualified for the ballot in November. The measure, the Arkansas Medical Cannabis Act, would allow seriously ill patients, who have a certification from their doctor, to obtain medical cannabis from nonprofit compassion centers. In addition, patients – or their licensed caregivers – could cultivate up to 10 cannabis plants at home provided they take steps to ensure it is secure. Support for medical marijuana in the state is strong, with one of the latest polls putting it at 58 percent which is in contrast to four years ago when a medical cannabis legalization measure in Arkansas failed by two percent.

<h2>MASSACHUSETTS</h2>
In July, Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin announced that the ‘Legalization, Regulation, and Taxation of Marijuana’ initiative will appear as Question 4 on the November ballot. The initiative would allow persons aged 21 and older to purchase, possess, use, and transfer marijuana and products containing marijuana concentrates, including edible products. It would also allow a taxed and regulated marijuana market in the state.

<h2>FLORIDA</h2>
Trulieve, the first dispensary to open in the Sunshine State, came on line in late July in Tallahassee. For now, only low-THC cannabis products will be available for Florida’s patients, but cannabis with more THC will eventually be available for terminally ill patients. To recommend or order the drug for a patient, doctors must have a three-month history with the patient, in addition to taking a ‘Low THC Cannabis’ Continuing Medical Education course, which is followed by an exam. Qualifying conditions for patients to use medical cannabis in Florida include cancer, seizures, or severe and persistent muscle spasms. If a patient qualifies, they will be assigned an identification number and added to a patient registry through the state. The state's Office of Compassionate Use, which oversees state regulation of medical cannabis, projects there will be dispensaries in 19 of Florida’s cities.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As director of the Medical Caregivers Institute, mccdirectory.org, Liz McDuffie is all about education. She has been teaching cannabis classes since 2006 in California and now she is bringing that valuable knowledge to Nevada. Her ultimate vision is to create a Nevada Medical Marijuana Information Resource Center that will house a cannabis bookstore, a cultivation workshop for patient growers, a doctor’s office with telemedicine services, and a classroom area. Of the center, McDuffie says, “I have lived it, I have done it, it’s the happiest place on earth.”

HOW DID YOU DISCOVER THE MEDICINAL BENEFITS OF CANNABIS?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">

When I discovered it in 1967 I was working in Germany for the Army. As a child I suffered from very severe headaches and those followed me into adulthood and they were very debilitating. I went to see a German doctor there and she recommended hashish, I didn’t know what it was or anything about it, but I did find hashish in Frankfurt. It didn’t stop the pain altogether but for the first time in my life I could function, and before I would have to go in a dark room and put ice on my head and it was just a really horrible experience. I was really impressed with this medicine and so I started reading about it and there was just a preponderance of history of its medicinal use and I became a proponent of cannabis as a medicine.

How did you become involved in the cannabis industry? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I decided the best way to proceed was to have an educational program and so I began to recruit people to work on getting the educational program together and teach California’s medical marijuana program and that’s how I started with MCC in 2006. The best way to put your foot in the community was to open a medical cannabis information and resource center. I promise you, no matter how much you are going to try to give out to that community, it’s nothing compared to what comes back to you in resources -- from cultivators to people with inventions. It’s been a breathless 10 years of working with all of these different instructors on topics that include everything from extraction to teaching physicians about compliant approval. It’s been so amazing to see what I have been able to see in terms of how this whole thing is moving ahead.

When you are speaking with cannabis opponents, what are your talking points?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

The more I studied cannabis, the more it became an amazing phenomenon. It was in our pharmacology prior to 1937 and the advantage of having this herb as a medicine was really wonderful and then suddenly it’s gone and demonized. It’s very hard when you are talking about the benefits of cannabis in the face of people being so convinced that it’s not a good thing. I stopped arguing about it and stopped defending it. I felt I was arguing that the earth was round. I ended up not feeling good about it until DJ Short (one of America’s most prolific cultivators) told me a few years ago how to handle it. He told me to ask those opposed, to name something safer and when he said that, it was just such a profound statement. So now that’s all I say. I just ask them to name something safer. Cannabis has never contributed to the death of anyone throughout its entire history and that’s quite a statement to make.

Why did you decide to open a Medical Caregivers Institute in Nevada? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I had to come to Nevada because the program just blew me away. That was absolutely a must. It was wonderful because, first of all, the program allowed physicians to own MMEs. That was it for me because for the very first time the medical was brought into the program. The federal government has kept the doctors at arm’s length because you can’t prescribe it, you can’t dose it. They tried very hard to keep that Pandora’s box shut, but thank goodness the federal government upheld the physician’s right to recommend it or approve it. But they drew that big red line – you can’t tell them where to get it, you can’t prescribe it. I said I went to Vegas for the doctors and that was true, it was everything to me because it put medicine into this program, it made it medical and doctors could own MMEs and that was defiant of federal laws.

What’s been the biggest surprise to you as far as discoveries in the cannabis field?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I went to speak to doctors in Mesquite and they are fine with cannabis but they are in these fishbowls there and they don’t want to be branded as the pot doc in that area. And I thought how in a state, like Nevada, are you going to reach all these doctors in these little towns and communities? I heard they were doing telemedicine in California so I wanted to see about doing that here in Nevada. When I found out from the medical board that telemedicine could be used in Nevada legally, I did the Jackie Gleason shuffle all the way down the hallway. Because one of my major goals, the irony of it, is that with all of these dispensaries and all of the beautiful stuff going on, is that we never got it to the people for whom it was intended. Is that an irony or what? Because they are in hospice, residential care, assisted living, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, senior daycare, that’s where they are and we now have telemedicine, that’s the final key to me. The reason telemedicine is legal for a physician’s approval, and I love this so much because that means it’s going to be legal in every state if they really push it, the very basis of the legality of using telemedicine in the healthcare field was for a physician to complete a medical form created by state statute. So it opens it up to every patient who can’t get to the doctor or to the dispensary. The telemedicine was a surprise, and that was the gift Nevada gave to me.

In addition to offering telemedicine at Medical Caregivers Institute, you have plans to start a Cultivation Workshop.
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFivetoo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I am trying to protect the individual’s right to grow so I want to open up a cultivation workshop, and create a safe place for patients to come and learn to grow. You are allowing these patients to participate in the program because that’s allowed in Nevada, that a patient who cultivates can take their medicine to a dispensary. When we get a workshop set up with 25 patients, it takes them 7 hours a week to maintain their plants. We will have a cultivation manager in the workshop at all times supervising activity. The patients will pay $350 to $400 per month to have the supervision and training to pay the overhead and electricity and after their crop is weighed in and documented it goes through the correct channels to get it into dispensaries and then that patient has reasonable compensation and they are getting that back to pay for overhead. You are allowing a patient to learn to cultivate and actually benefit and be a part of the program. Those 25 patients can generate 30 lbs. every seven to eight weeks of organic medicine that is Clean Green certified.

Tell me how your Cultivation Workshops got started. 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I taught a two-tent system; one with four vegs in one tent and as those two are flowering, you take two out of the veg and stick them in the flowering tent, and put two new clones in to replace them. Then you have a perpetual harvest going in this damn little system every seven to eight weeks. I taught this small scale growing system for five years, then one day I had a fire here in the grow because one of the wires was faulty. The insurance company came in and fixed everything up and I was back in business. That’s when I found out there was no insurance for anyone cultivating in a residence, and that’s serious because when you are growing inside, you have got a lot of plugs going on. You have got aerators, fans, lights, if you are doing hydro you’ve also got that so when I got that news I felt like the stupidest ass on the planet. I mean if a kid got burned or someone lost their house, here I am teaching this damn system. But when you think about it, Nevada is allowing people to grow, and there’s no insurance for it. In a sense that’s a liability to the state. The night of the fire was an epiphany for me, I realized it’s really not the right place to grow, in your neighborhood. And where is that going if you have two plants and you can only have two ounces? So that was the birth of the cultivation workshop. And I mean to tell you I have lived it, I have done it, it’s the happiest place on earth. The system is so simplistic, I set it up in the center and the plants are in there growing.

Do you have any concerns about Nevada’s regulations? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I am wondering when someone is going to tackle the 800lb. gorilla in the room. The state is allowing individual patients to cultivate 12 plants; well, the fact is you are only allowed to have two ounces of medicine but the minute you grow one plant you are over the two ounces. You have the plant harvesting and you have got eight ounces or 12 ounces on one plant. Or let’s say six ounces, you are only allowed to have two ounces. The question is what happens to that extra medicine? Is it a set up? So if your neighbor complains, and the police come and you are over the limit, you are now fodder for the courts. So if, indeed, you are going to allow these people to grow 12 plants, let them grow it in a safe, secure and insured environment. And let them not get in trouble with overproducing when they are over their two ounces. So what happens if they are over? No one chooses to address that. That’s just setting you up. How do you handle that? Once you do that, what are you supposed to do? Go bury it out in the desert? I keep bringing it up to people and nobody wants to address it but it’s serious.

<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I see the Nevada Medical Marijuana Information Resource Center as a place where these is a cannabis bookstore, a little kiosk for juices, 10 participants doing the workshop and tending to the plants. There’s also a doctor’s office in there, a classroom area and that’s sort of a vision I have. And take this back to your state and your community and this is the way you protect the patient’s right to cultivate by providing a safe, insured supervised environment, and you let the patient participate in the program by growing for other patients.

More recently I have decided the project I want to collect data on, and the one I wanted to introduce in Nevada and we have the infrastructure to start, is working with patients who are using opiates. That’s a good, good study. Record those opiates they are using and the frequency that they are being used and simply collect data on to what extent cannabis is affecting that use and to be able to show that it reduces the need for opiates is very, very important and to what extent. That’s a study I would like to formally start.

<div class="panel-body">

They make California look like ‘oh please.’ I love the way the patient is handled in Nevada. There are big LED signs with information and educational seminars and brochures and that’s not happening in California. The educational part of it excites me. The Nevada dispensaries have made it such a beautiful environment, we (California) have got some things to learn with regard to Nevada’s educational offerings. That’s missing here in many places, most I would say.

<div class="panel-body">

I see Nevada as the vortex of the industry in the US because of the steps it’s taken and what it’s doing right now. I believe out of Nevada will come the most amazing medicines. I see us getting back to pharmacology, you will be able to go to your pharmacy and get this cannabis medicine because what we are seeing now is that it is reemerging back into the pharmacology. That’s where ultimately it will go. It is hard to predict, but the good thing is that it’s back and it’s accepted. This wonderful, wonderful plant and what it can do in so many areas of our lives not just as far as medicine, but all that hemp can do including nutrition, and the products it can produce from fabric to hemp concrete blocks that are earthquake resistant. Imagine if we have hemp constructed materials for earthquakes in California. I am grateful I am here to see it before I exit the planet.

		<title>THE ESSENTIAL VAPE GUIDE  AN INTRODUCTION TO THE CITY’S  MOST POPULAR VAPE PENS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Justin Alexander</h4>
<p>Most medical experts would agree that vaping cannabis is healthier than smoking it. By using a vape pen, patients are able to avoid inhaling the harmful by-products found in cannabis smoke. Although studies on the subject aren’t plentiful, there has been some research that shows vaporizing eliminates harmful toxins, shows a decrease in respiratory symptoms, and preliminary data from a 2010 study even reveals meaningful improvements in respiratory function. Because vaping is a discreet and less harmful way of ingesting cannabis, elevate has compiled a guide of the city’s most popular vape pens.</p>
<h3>JORGE’S DIAMOND CARTRIDGE, THE+SOURCE</h3>
<p>Jorge’s Diamond, an Indica-dominant hybrid with a ratio of 53.1% THC to 0.1% CBD, reduces inflammation and pain, acts as a sleep aid, and presses delete on the day’s anxieties. The taste is sweet and smooth and the feeling of euphoria is long lasting resulting in a deep calm. This strain is also great at inducing hunger with its intense fruit-forward flavors. </p>
<p>The most striking feature of The+Source’s Jorge’s Diamond cartridge is the viscosity of the oil and its deep amber color. “We mix our cartridges with propylene glycol, which is used in baby inhalers,” Chris Vickers, general manager at The+Source, says, noting the darker it is, the more highly concentrated, due to less mixing agent. Another reason for the dark color is that as cannabis grows it develops trichomes, or crystals. At 10 to 12 weeks, the trichomes actually change to a dark amber color. Also, Indica is normally darker because it has more resin in it.</p>
<p>A wide variety of strains are grown and then extracted by the production team to make cartridges at The+Source’s cultivation facility. According to Vickers, their cartridges are crafted with a ceramic plate versus a wick, which gives better flavor and an even vapor. Currently, The+Source has more than 10 strains available as pens and cartridges. With new scientific developments to help with extraction, the product is improving with each release. Also, vapor cartridges provide a healthier alternative to smoking because they separate the patient’s lungs from the combustion of a lighter, ultimately resulting in the patient ingesting fewer carcinogens when inhaling cannabinoids.</p>
<h3>KABUNKY KLEAR SKYWALKER OG, KABUNKY MARIJUANA PRODUCTS</h3>
<pSuperb for pain relief and relaxation with its reaching-for-new-levels climb, at 79.24% THC Kabunky Clear Skywalker OG promotes a sound and peaceful sleep without any worries. This Indica-dominant hybrid cartridge packs all the same outstanding qualities for which Skywalker OG flower is known, such as the great all-over body feeling.</p>
<p>“The terpenes and cannabinoids in the Kabunky Klear pen are pure. No plant matter or lipids,” explains Ronan McConnon, laboratory manager of Kabunky Concentrates. Overall, vape concentrate is more discreet because there is no burn factor and it is easier on the lungs than smoking flower. McConnon says he will be releasing “exciting flavors” in the next few months.</p>
<p>The purity of the product accounts for the clarity. “Each step of the process removes contaminants,” McConnon says, noting that he does not use glycol or glycerine. “Pure cannabinoids and terpenes will always have a honey color.”</p>
<p>Kabunky is a 100 percent self-contained operation: They grow the cannabis, process the raw material, and load the pens. McConnon used his biochemistry and physics background to develop an extraction process that affords the purest cannabis product possible. “The viscosity is managed during the process so that I do not have to use additives like PG, PEG, VG,” McConnon explains. “The oil is activated, so you can vape at lower temperatures without sacrificing potency.” Kabunky cartridges have only a two percent mechanical fail rate and an instant replacement guarantee.</p>
<h3>EG.O TRIP PLUS SATIVA, EVERGREEN ORGANIX</h3>
<p>EG.O Trip Plus Sativa by Evergreen Organix is based on Sour Diesel, which is legendary for being cerebrally-charged and provides relief from stress, pain and depression with a THC component that ranges between 50 and 70 percent. The feeling is energetic, creative, happy and euphoric. This won’t put you in a trance and it will get you off the couch, promoting big idea flow. Sour Diesel, as its name suggests, smells like lemons and diesel fuel, a surprisingly harmonious pairing. All these factors equate to immediate relief for most ailments. </p>
<p>According to Jillian Nelson, operations manager of Evergreen Organix, more strain-specific vapes will be available soon so patients will have access to varieties such as Sweet Tooth and Silver Surfer. The above products are not flavored because Evergreen is focusing on quality oil versus synthetic taste, but the EG.O line will eventually be expanded with more options.</p>
<p>EG.O Trip Plus Sativa’s deep, dark shade of amber is a result of the CO2 extraction process. </p>
<p>Evergreen Organix grows the flower for its EG.O Trip Plus cartridge in its own cultivation facility. Evergreen Organix started production and cultivation in fall 2015, growing and making cannabis-infused edibles, topicals and vapes. Made with only strain-specific flower, this is a trim-free product. While the Evergreen Organix vapes are new to market, the oil has been in development for several months to ensure quality and consistency. The overall goal was to create a formula that wasn’t cut with propylene glycol or vegetable glycerin. “Finding a way to refine CO2 extract to vape-quality was a little challenging at first,” Nelson says. “Our team developed a refining method that gave us a great end product that keeps almost all of the qualities of the original flower that it was extracted from.”</p>
<h3>MTF, KYND CANNABIS COMPANY</h3>
<p>As a strain, everything about the Sativa-dominate MTF is big and strong—giant earthy, piney, fruitiness with a long-lasting body high. It tastes like a run through the forest on a crisp autumn day or a spicy Mexican hot chocolate with just enough chili powder to ignite all the senses. At a ratio of 58.71% THC to .2% CBD, MTF gives a steady euphoric rise, sustained stress relief and energy, and increased mental clarity. </p>
<p>According to Kynd Cannabis’ Ryan Clendenin, MTF’s aromas are derived from a perfect storm of terpinolene, limonene, humulene, beta-caryophyllene and beta-pinene. “Each cartridge is strain-specific and homogenized from industrial scale batches of vape oil,” he says. While Kynd potency numbers may appear lower in THC, they are partnered with incredible terpene profiles that express each strain’s medicinal potential to its fullest.</p>
<p>The light color of the oil and absence of plant waxes and chlorophyll can be attributed to a process known as winterization that refines the vape oils without losing or stripping out their best characteristics. Raw cannabis extract is bathed in lab quality ethanol, it gets cold, and then undesirables are filtered out of the extract. “The alcohol is then distilled off of the solution in order to retain a pristine oil,” Clendenin explains. “This process also preserves terpenes, increases the shelf stability of the cannabis oil and the overall potency to weight ratio of the final product.”</p>
<p>Kynd Cannabis Company products are born and bred in a state-of-the-art indoor, controlled agricultural environment and a lab grade production facility in Sparks, Nevada. “Kynd vape oil is extracted using supercritical CO2 to selectively extract the whole plant compounds needed to bring out all of the essential characteristics of the MTF and other strains,” Clendenin says. “Kynd Vape oils will never touch hydrocarbons like butane or propane, and will never need to endure the extreme temperatures of laboratory distillation techniques in order to purify the product.”</p>
<h3>CRAFT RESERVE MR. NICE, O.PEN VAPE FROM THE GROVE</h3>
<p>Mr. Nice, an Indica-dominant strain, is super strong on both the nose and palate. While it comes on with force, overall it’s a mellow high that works ideally for daytime use when focus and attentiveness is imperative. Patients will experience only mild pain relief, but super stress relief with this strain, which is comprised of 94.4% THC, 2.04% CBN and 2.42% CBD.</p>
<p>Its almost clear, golden quality is achieved through distillation. “The color of the oil is achieved through a proprietary process, but, in short, we are using very high-quality strains of hand-picked flower put through a distillation process to include the same strain-cannabis terpenes reintroduced to give you a fully activated, pristine oil,” explains Robbie Wright, head of production for The Grove, which has a partnership with Colorado-based O.Pen. </p>
<p>Craft Reserve oil is made using a CO2 extraction and then a refinement process that yields high-quality oil. “The goal for me actually isn't necessarily the highest THC percentage possible, but rather the most activated cannabinoid profile, including a full terpene profile,” says Wright, who notes The Grove sources 75 percent of its flower and trim from its own cultivation facility.</p>
<p>One of the smoothest puffs on the market, the O.Pen Craft Reserve oil is comprised of 100-percent cannabis-derived terpenes medicating with consistency. The packaging, like the name, emphasizes a craft experience with a hewn look. The cartridge has a metal tip and a chamber that is noticeably smaller than comparable products. Its vessel comes filled with 250 mgs. </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Darryl Johnson, Ph.D., and Bruce Burnett, M.D., Ace Analytical Laboratory</h4>
<p>Nevada has positioned itself at the forefront of cannabis safety and potency testing by requiring all medical marijuana products to undergo laboratory testing. Following analysis from a Nevada-accredited Independent Testing Laboratory, a “lot” of sample is given a Certificate of Analysis (COA), which displays safety and potency testing results. While the information provided on a COA may seem overwhelming, these results can be invaluable when deciding which strain will be best suited to address a patient’s medical needs. The following glossary is intended to assist patients when selecting a medicinal cannabis product.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Indica </span>species of the cannabis plant typically associated with inducing a body-high. Indica strains tend to have sedative and relaxing effects, best suited to treat anxiety, insomnia, pain, and muscle spasms.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Sativa </span>species of the cannabis plant typically associated with inducing a cerebral-high. Sativa strains tend to be uplifting and creative, best suited to treat depression, ADD, fatigue, and mood disorders.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Hybrid </span>a combination of indica and sativa genetics and characteristics. Hybrid strains can be indica- or sativa-dominate and are typically described as a ratio, such as 80/20 indica-dominate or 60/40 sativa-dominate.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Cannabinoid </span>compounds found in the cannabis plant that interact with cannabinoid receptors producing the psychoactive and medicinal effects associated with cannabis use. In cannabis, cannabinoids are concentrated in glandular structures known as trichomes.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Trichome </span>small crystal-like hairs that cover cannabis buds, giving them a frosty appearance. Trichomes consist of a stalk and resin gland, and are responsible for producing cannabinoids and terpenes in the cannabis plant.  </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Terpene </span>small aromatic compounds that give cannabis distinct flavors and smells. Cannabis contains more than 100 different terpenes, many of which are found in other plants, fruits, and flowers.  Terpenes are found in significantly different concentrations in different strains, which can help explain why different strains have different effects for patients. </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Alpha-Bisabolol (terpene) </span>has a floral, earthy, herbal scent and is used in some cosmetics. It is known to have anti-inflammatory, anti-irritant, and anti-microbial properties.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Alpha-Humulene (terpene)  </span>possesses a hoppy, herbal scent and is also found in hops, sage, and ginseng.  It is believed to have anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antibacterial properties. </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Alpha-Pinene (terpene) </span>is the most common terpenoid found in nature, possessing a pine resin scent. It is also found in rosemary, sage, and pine trees. Primary effects include anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, bronchodilator, and anti-cancer. Alpha-pinene is believed to improve mental focus and memory retention. </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Alpha-Terpinolene (terpene) </span>possesses a woody, smoky odor and is also found in lilac, tea tree, apple, and cumin. It has both antibacterial and antifungal effects and can function as a mosquito repellent. In addition, it also has potent antioxidant effects and is thought to have anti-proliferative properties. </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Beta-Caryophyllene (terpene) </span>has a spicy, wood aroma and is found in herbs and spices including black pepper, oregano, cloves, hops, and rosemary. It possesses analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antifungal, and antidepressant properties. It activates CB2 receptors even though it is not a cannabinoid.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Beta-Myrcene (terpene) </span>is most commonly associated with indica strains of cannabis and has a musky, herbal scent with hints of citrus flavors. It has sedative properties, and may be useful in treating insomnia, muscle spasms, and inflammation.  </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Beta-Pinene (terpene)  </span>is similar to alpha-pinene, possessing pine scents and is abundant in nature. Along with analgesic, bronchodilator, and anti-inflammatory effects, it is also believed to possess antitumor properties. </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Caryophyllene Oxide (terpene) </span>is closely related to beta-caryophyllene and possesses a lemon balm odor. It is likely the primary odor which drug-sniffing dogs use to identify cannabis.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Limonene (terpene) </span>has a citrus, lemon odor and is also found in citrus fruits, rosemary, juniper, and peppermint. Limonene is thought to possess antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects and is used to treat acid reflux and relieve nausea.  </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Linalool (terpene) </span>has a flora scent and is found in lavender, mint and cinnamon. It possesses anti-anxiety, anti-depressant, sedative, and pain relief effects. Some evidence suggests it may have antitumor properties against certain human cancers. </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Delta 9 Tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) (cannabinoid) </span>is the biologically active form of THCA. It is the most abundant cannabinoid in cannabis and possesses psychoactive properties. In addition, Δ9-THC also possesses analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-emetic properties.</p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Tetrahydrocannabinol Acid (THCA) (cannabinoid)  </span>is the non-psychoactive form of Δ9-THC. Following heating or burning, THCA is converted into the psychoactive compound Δ9-THC. THCA is thought to have neuroprotective, anti-spasmodic, anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and anti-vomiting properties. </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Cannabidiol (CBD) (cannabinoid)  </span>is non-psychoactive, but evidence suggests it improves mood and can alleviate pain. CBD also possesses sedative, anti-nausea, anti-seizure, anti-spasticity, anti-inflammatory, anti-anxiety, and antipsychotic properties. In addition, it has shown beneficial effects for pediatric seizure patients with Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.  </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Cannabidiolic Acid (CBDA) (cannabinoid)  </span>is the acidic form of CBD, commonly found in cannabis plants with elevated CBD levels. It possesses antioxidant, neuro-protective, antiemetic, and potent antimicrobial effects. </p>
<p><span style="font-size:24px">Cannabinol (CBN) (cannabinoid)  </span>is a degradation product of THC. It has psychoactive properties similar to Δ9-THC, but only at about one-tenth of the potency. CBN has powerful sedative properties and has been shown to possess pain relieving, anticoagulant, antimicrobial, and antidiarrheal properties.</p>

		<title>Demystifying Clinical eCB Syndrome</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Stephen McCamman</h4>
<p>We've all been bombarded by the “disease awareness” campaigns sponsored by pharmaceutical companies. You've probably even had the experience of rubbing your eyes as you toddle off to bed mumbling to yourself “maybe I do have chronic dry eye syndrome.” </p>
<p>Unfortunately, these ads play to our deep seated concerns about the frequency of our bowel movements (CIC), the quality of our sexual performance (ED), or our potentially restless legs (RLS) while putting billions of dollars into the pharmaceutical industry's pockets. Often, as we know, the side effects are sometimes worse than the issue the drug claims to cure. </p>
<p>It is understandable, then, if you are skeptical about yet another syndrome, or a pharmaceutical claiming to cure yet another disease. However, unlike the pharmaceutical industry's faux diseases, Endocannabinoid Deficiency Syndrome flips the script and may, in fact, be the underlying deficiency of a large number of diseases that modern medicine has failed to cure: one disease with a thousand faces. </p>
<p>eCB deficiency has been linked to migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia. Recent research also suggests that autoimmune diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus as well as mood disorders such as anxiety and depression, may also be linked to eCB deficiency. More clinical research is necessary to scientifically confirm this, but thousands of patients have found relief through regulating their eCB system.</p>
<h3>YOUR BODY’S OWN MARIJUANA</h3>
<p>Your endocannabinoid system is a physiological signaling network spread throughout the body that keeps the other systems, such as the immune system, digestive system, and central nervous system (yes, pretty darn important stuff) operating at an optimal level. In other words, it keeps your major systems in balance, or homeostasis, and acts as a major part of the body's self-healing system. </p>
<p>You'll be surprised to learn that as part of this eCB system, your body essentially makes its own marijuana. The hormones, called endocannabinoids, are the body's way of regulating the other bodily systems. For a variety of reasons, including poor diet, inactivity, and environmental toxins, and an absence of hemp oil and seeds from our diet, the eCB system is not producing enough endocannabinoids to manage the job of regulating the other systems, hence the deficiency.</p>
<h3>WHAT IS CLINICAL ENDOCANNABINOID DEFICIENCY SYNDROME?</h3>
<p>In 2004, Ethan Russo, M.D. coined the termed Clinical Endocannabinoid Deficiency Syndrome (eCB Syndrome for short) to describe this problem. His research into the endocannabinoid system revealed that three conditions -- migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, and fibromyalgia -- usually appear in a cluster, that is, people with one of these problems usually had the other two. </p>
<p>eCB Deficiency Syndrome is not yet part of the official diagnostic bible your doctor uses, but it explains why some diseases are not successfully treated with conventional medications (they’re treating the symptom, not the cause) and why those diseases are best managed by cannabis and hemp-based medicinal products.</p>
<p>While there are other reasons, including inherited problems, for a dysfunctional eCB system, common sense tells us that the primary reason for an overall deficiency of our body's own marijuana is dietary and lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>eCB Syndrome may also emerge following sustained unhealthy lifestyle habits, including stress and chronic alcohol or drug abuse, among others, that may act as a cumulative “trigger” in the development of presenting symptoms. These chronic, sustained stressors on the body and mind suggest that eCB Syndrome may appear more frequently in middle aged or older people as it may take the body years to develop the symptoms of these endocannabinoid system inhibitory factors.</p>
<h3>RESOLVING ECB SYNDROME</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is take a look at your diet and lifestyle. Detoxifying the body through fasting and healthy eating is the first step toward optimum health. Of course, you've heard it before, but getting out for moderate exercise also up-regulates the eCB system. Getting rid of chemical-laden soaps, shampoos, and body creams can eliminate chemicals that disrupt your endocrine system, but may also impact your endocannabinoid system. (Visit www.elevatenv.com/endocannabinoidsystem to read more and access healthy recipes designed to regulate your eCB system.) </p>
<p>Meditation and various talk therapies have demonstrated benefits of alleviating eCB Syndrome. Moreover, massage therapy with or without cannabinoid-infused oils (though the latter is recommended) acupuncture, chiropractic work, yoga, and spiritual practices may also be effective tools in properly toning the eCB system. In addition, learning to relax, getting a good night’s sleep (all of which can be achieved through cannabis use) enhances quality of life.</p>
<p>Getting a medical marijuana card in Nevada, or using your out-of-state card, and visiting a local medical marijuana dispensary is perhaps the best way to jumpstart optimizing your eCB system. Starting with a pure CBD tincture is the safest route to take as CBD is non-psychoactive and doesn't show up on an employment urine test. Most dispensaries in Nevada have well-trained staff who can assist you in choosing the correct product and helping you accurately dose.</p>
<p>If CBDs, coupled with lifestyle and dietary changes, don't improve your condition, moving toward THC products is the next logical step. Be sure you are aware of the risks before embarking down this path. Each person reacts differently so start at a low dose and go slow when choosing to consume more psychoactive products. </p>
<p>Everyone reacts to and processes cannabinoids in a unique manner. Accurate dosing and recording your improvement in a health journal is fundamental to the development of a successful treatment protocol. Experimentation with dosage, cannabinoid and terpene combinations, as well as a method of administration may be necessary. </p>
<p>The road to resolving your eCB deficiency has many curves in it. It includes altering lifestyle choices, exercising, reducing life stressors, changing your diet, and getting on a regime of cannabinoid therapies. If eCB deficiency is one deficiency with a thousand faces, then the solution is making a thousand proper choices to improve one life: yours. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Julie Vigil</h4>
<p>Opioid pain killers don’t just kill pain, they kill people.</p>
<p>According to the most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 2014 was a killer year. More people died from drug overdoses than in car crashes or by gun violence. And more than half of those overdoses were linked to opioid analgesics or heroin. </p>
<p>To put a finer point on this statistic, that’s 47,055 lethal overdoses. Of those deaths, 18,893 were from prescription painkillers and 10,574 were from heroine. Compared to the almost 30,000 who died by either car crashes or gun violence — those are some sobering stats.</p>
<p>When nearly 29,000 people die from an opioid overdose in one year — that’s 78 Americans per day — it’s safe to say we have an addiction problem of epidemic proportions. The CDC agrees.</p>
<p>This addiction crisis didn’t just happen overnight though, and it isn’t just about illegal street drugs like heroin. What led to our escalating dependence on opioids are simple American ideals like customer satisfaction, instant gratification, and profit.</p>
<h3>Just What the Doctor Ordered</h3>
<p>Prior to the 1990s, strong opioid painkillers were typically reserved for the dying, not for your run-of-the-mill acute or chronic pain patients. So while millions of patients were complaining about all kinds of pain, doctors were eager to find better solutions to ease their patients’ ailments.</p>
<p>Enter the industry leader in pain management: Purdue Pharma. The pharmaceutical company was already enjoying much success with its popular pain meds, including hydromorphone, oxycodone, fentanyl, codeine, and hyrocodone, but apparently it wasn’t enough to satiate patients’ pain complaints, doctors’ desires to relieve their patients’ pain, or the pharmaceutical company’s quest for more profit. So after some tinkering, in 1996 it slapped a time-release element onto oxycodone (ensuring a new patent and exclusive sales until 2025) and crowned it OxyContin.</p>
<p>OxyContin is the company’s golden child, or rather its golden goose, and Purdue did everything in its power to promote it far and wide as a miracle drug. Armed with its “new” formula, Purdue Pharma set out to proselytize the medical community, claiming that because of the time-release component, OxyContin was nearly impossible to abuse and its risk of addiction was “under one percent.”</p>
<p>That was music to doctors’ ears. Who wouldn’t be sold on a powerful narcotic that was great at helping a wide array of chronic ailments and only boasted a mere 0.028 percent addiction rate?</p>
<p>Physicians ate up Purdue’s marketing campaigns and patients gobbled up the pills as fast as their docs 
could write a ’scrip. The plan was working. And starting in 2012, according to CDC data, doctors prescribed enough opioid painkillers to give a bottle of pills to every adult in the country.</p>
<p>But the information Purdue Pharma was aggressively spreading was misleading at best, and flagrantly false at its worst. The company not only promised its drug was safe, it harped on its effectiveness and ease of use. Oxy sales skyrocketed.</p>
<p>OxyContin and other opioid painkillers are powerful drugs that are an effective treatment for addressing chronic and severe pain, but with long-term use its addictive properties betray its benefits. Patients’ tolerance builds so rapidly that users need ever-increasing doses to achieve the same initial effect. Forget the marketing mantras, addiction was inevitable. </p>

<h3>A Prescription for Addiction</h3>
<p>As it turns out, the three “studies” Purdue Pharma based all of its “educational” information on were misrepresented, exaggerated, or fictionalized. In a review by the FDA in 2001, Dr. Art Van Zee concluded that Purdue Pharma had “oversold the benefits of opioid therapy for chronic non-malignant pain, while providing false reassurance about what the real risks are of addiction for patients taking (them).”</p>
<p>The time-release component was supposed to be a great safety feature but it was just a thin, waxy coating that was so easy to scrape off it was as if it was actually designed to be abused rather than be a deterrent. Sadly, when the pills and prescriptions ran out, for many people, it was just easier and cheaper to turn to street drugs like heroin to catch the same elusive highs.</p>
<p>The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) reports four in five new heroin users started out misusing prescription painkillers. The overdose death rate quadrupled between 2000 and 2013, with an average increase of six percent per year up to 2010; from 2010-2013 heroin overdoses increased 37 percent.</p>
<p>The ASAM data also show that from 1999-2008 overdose death rates, sales, and substance use disorder treatment admissions related to prescription pain relievers increased in parallel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Purdue Pharma, fully owned by the Sackler family, was rolling around in piles and piles of profits. In 1996, OxyContin’s freshman year sales were $40 million dollars. Five years later, sales ballooned to $1.1 billion; by 2011, $2.8 billion. </p>
<p>On the flipside, in the biggest-littlest coup in pharmaceutical lawsuits ever, in 2007 Purdue Pharma and three of its top executives were court-ordered to pay a $634 million penalty for misbranding OxyContin. No one went to jail. The penalty only amounted to less than half of the company’s annual OxyContin sales that year. It was more like ripping off a Band-Aid; it hurts for a second but you’re okay. Today, the Sackler family is sitting pretty on Forbes’ magazine list of Top 20 Wealthiest Families with a conservative estimated net worth of $14 billion.</p>
<p>The company is still marketing its pain pills, but now they do it under the industry-accepted guise of “public-service” programs, resources and informational web sites aimed to educate doctors, pharmacists, patients, families, and law enforcement on the benefits of opioid pain meds for chronic pain as well as some nods to prescription drug addiction.</p>
<p>One positive to come of this marketing-blitz-turned-public-health-crisis is that more formal government attention (but not necessarily more money) is being placed on the epidemic and some efforts are underway to begin addressing it. The CDC presented guidelines and in July President Obama signed the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act in to law. Both of these measures discuss multiple pathways to improving the prescribing of opioids, expanding treatments for addiction, and reducing access to illegal opioids.</p>
<h3>The Elephant in the Exam Room</h3>
<p>While recognizing the problem is a noble start, the elephant in the room remains. As everyone’s looking the other way trying to find options for handling painkillers in a more responsible manner and dealing with addiction, nobody’s addressing the core issue. </p>
<p>“Western medicine doesn’t always have all the answers so let’s look at what will actually help patients versus just shoving a pill down everyone’s throat. Some people can’t sleep so we give them a sleeping pill versus actually figuring out why they can’t sleep. If they have pain, we give them pain medication. If they’re having anxiety, there’s a medication for anxiety versus figuring out why they have these symptoms. We have become a society of people looking for quick fixes. This is how all the doctor shopping and patients going to pill mills was created in the first place,” offers Dr. Pouya Mohajer, a local pain management doctor who is part of NuVeda, which holds six medical marijuana establishment licenses in Nevada, two of which are for dispensaries.</p>
<p>Another local physician, Dr. Timothy Beckett of Valley Center for Cannabis Therapy, agrees. “The time when we’re just going to throw a drug at an illness is coming to an end. We’ve gotten ourselves in trouble time and time again because of that. </p>
<p>“So bringing in something like medical marijuana, which certainly doesn’t have the addictive potential that something like opioids has nor does it have all of the horrible side effects or potential overdose and death associated with it, is a fantastic thing to bring to this whole regimen of treating opioid abuse and pain.” </p>
<p>Drs. Beckett and Mohajer are not alone in exploring cannabis as an alternative. More and more, doctors are turning to cannabis as an option for weaning people off opioids, and with good reason. A July 2015 paper published in theJournal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) cited evidence that cannabis is effective at treating chronic pain. The JAMA review found "30 percent or greater improvement in pain with cannabinoid compared with placebo," across 79 studies it surveyed.</p>
<p>In a study published by National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), also from July 2015, titled ‘Do Medical Marijuana Laws Reduce Addictions and Deaths Related to Pain Killers?’, researchers found that access to state-sanctioned medical marijuana dispensaries is linked to a significant decrease in both prescription painkiller abuse, and in overdose deaths from prescription painkillers. </p>
<p>In the NBER study, authors reviewed admissions to substance abuse treatment programs for opiate addiction as well 
as opiate overdose deaths in states 
that do and do not have medical marijuana laws. Researchers found that the presence of marijuana dispensaries was associated with a 15 to 35 percent decrease in substance abuse admissions. Opiate overdose deaths decreased by a similar amount. "Our findings suggest that providing broader access to medical marijuana may have the potential benefit of reducing abuse of highly addictive painkillers," the researchers concluded.</p>
<p>Dr. Beckett has seen it prove true in his practice. “I think it’s been tremendously successful in solely treating pain. I’ve seen fantastic results in patients. For the patients who come here who are truly motivated to get off of their opioid or to, at least, reduce the consumption of opioids, again, it’s been very very successful. I can’t think of an instance where medical marijuana wouldn’t in some way or another reduce the amount of pain and/or opioid dependence that a person would be experiencing,” he explains.</p>
<p>Dr. Mohajer has also found cannabis to be effective, noting that 80 percent of the patients he has seen experience a positive response. “Anecdotally, I do have the patients who come back and the ones that it’s working for, they are the ones who we start cutting their narcotics down as much as we can,” he explains.</p>
<h3>Could Cannabis be the Remedy?</h3>
<p>But cannabis doesn’t just aid in getting people off opiates, it also addresses the underlying problem.</p>
<p>“Cannabis actually has a lot of the anti-inflammatory properties that are necessary to fix things that are at the root of the pain itself,” explains Dr. Beckett. “When we give somebody cannabis for their pain issues, we’re literally treating it in two phases. We have this acute, within 24-hour, phase where the cannabis itself is going to make you feel good, it’s going help change your perception of the pain, it’s going help change the way you experience the pain. </p>
<p>“Then we have this kind of delayed response that is the real meat and bones of it, which is the anti-inflammatory effects of the CBD (cannabidiol) property of the cannabis. It’s basically quieting down those nerves, quieting down the swelling and all the problems to get to the root of the actual pain itself,” continues Dr. Beckett. “That’s why a person who uses medical marijuana twice a day in 50 years could probably still be using medical marijuana twice a day or maybe even less to treat that same ailment. Whereas, if you look at somebody on opioids, they could be using two pills a day and in six months they’ll be using 20 pills a day."</p>
<p>JBut is cannabis the solution? “I’ve been practicing for 13 years and this is the only thing that I’ve come across that has such widespread medicinal benefits or health benefits for so many different classes of patients,” concludes Dr. Beckett. </p>
<p>“And we haven’t even hit the tip of the iceberg yet for all the different benefits that we’re going to be able to find in the long-run with something like marijuana.”  </p>


<h3>Opiate abuse by the numbers</h3>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px">
<li>Of the 21.5 million Americans 12 or older who had a substance use disorder in 2014, 1.9 million had a substance use disorder involving prescription pain relievers and 586,000 had a substance use disorder involving heroin. --American Society of Addiction Medicine </li>
<li>Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the US, with 47,055 lethal drug overdoses in 2014. Opioid addiction is driving this epidemic, with 18,893 overdose deaths related to prescription pain relievers, and 10,574 overdose deaths related to heroin in 2014. 
--American Society of Addiction Medicine 
</li>
<li>94% of respondents in a 2014 survey of people in treatment for opioid addiction said they chose to use heroin because prescription opioids were “far more expensive and harder to obtain.” --American Society of Addiction Medicine </li>
<li>In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for opioids, which is more than enough to give every American adult their own bottle of pills. -- American Society of Addiction Medicine </li>
<li>4.3 million Americans engaged in non-medical use of prescription painkillers in the last month. –National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH); 2014</li>
<li>In 2014, almost 2 million Americans abused or were dependent on prescription opioids. --Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, National Survey on Drug Use and Health; 2014</li>
<li>Every day, over 1,000 people are treated in emergency departments for misusing prescription opioids. --Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration; 2013</li>
<li>As many as 1 in 4 people who receive prescription opioids long term for non-cancer pain in primary care settings struggles with addiction. –Addiction; 2010 </li>
<li>Overdose deaths involving prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999, and so have sales of these prescription drugs. From 1999 to 2014, more than 165,000 people have died in the U.S. from overdoses related to prescription opioids. --National Center for Health Statistics; 2015 & 2016 </li>
<li>Today, at least half of all U.S. opioid overdose deaths involve a prescription opioid. In 2014, more than 14,000 people died from overdoses involving prescription opioids. --National Center for Health Statistics; 2016</li>

		<title>NEUROPATHY PATIENT IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE BY MAKING SWITCH FROM  OPIATES TO CBD OIL</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a result of a car accident in 1989, Lance Daniels, 46, was paralyzed from the waist down. Even though he was told he would never walk again, four years after the accident Daniels suddenly stood up one day and with the help of his walker started to hobble across the room.  </p>
<p>“My doctors were surprised -- it was nothing but a miracle. The doctors had no explanation for why I could suddenly walk again because they had told me I would be paralyzed for the rest of my life,” he explains.</p>
<p>Miracle aside, there were other after effects from the accident. “I knew something was wrong because I was dizzy all the time, I was seeing dark spots, and my head was so hot I had to sleep in front of a fan. They did MRIs and CAT scans and they couldn’t find nothing,” says Daniels. “I went to the doctor and he and his colleagues were going back and forth and they finally decided I had a four-millimeter tumor in my pituitary gland.” </p>
<p>Days after his diagnosis in April 2007 Daniels suffered a stroke. In spite of the stroke, his doctors discouraged chemotherapy and radiation and instead determined they couldn’t operate on Daniels’ tumor until it was 12 millimeters in diameter. During Daniels’ last checkup in April his tumor was eight millimeters. But Daniel’s believes his tumor must be growing because he has started to suffer from headaches.</p>
<p>Earlier this year due to the recent FDA/DEA cracking down on opiate abuse, Daniels’ doctors encouraged him to consider using cannabis in lieu of narcotics. “I have a lot of nerve damage from the tumor in my pituitary gland pressing on my nerves so my legs were in so much pain,” says Daniels, who was taking 60 milligrams of morphine and 30 milligrams of oxycontin daily. “They wanted to take me off of it and to use marijuana instead to help with my nerve pain.”</p>
<p>Daniels was not an easy sell. His mother is a pastor and so he was raised with a church upbringing and had moral issues with marijuana. “I am so against it,” he says, noting his mother and sister were also not proponents. It was a friend who finally talked Daniels into giving CBD oil capsules a try this past March.</p>
<p>“It actually worked. I have more energy, I stopped using my morphine and oxy. My bottles are full because I don’t need them anymore due to marijuana. I hadn’t even touched them and that’s when I decided I am going with this all the way,” proclaims Daniels. “I feel more energetic, my mind is clear, I am thinking better and before I was slurring my words. I am motivated now. I have taken out a loan to start a business. If I wasn’t taking these pills, there’s no way I would have had the motivation or drive to pursue my business ideas. </p>
<p>“With that pill it made me do the impossible and everything is positive.” </p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>MICHIGAN</h2>
The Michigan State Senate has cleared the way for a new statewide regulatory system for the medical cannabis industry by passing a package of five related bills, the Detroit News reported. House Bills 4209, 4210, and 4827, along with Senate Bills 141 and 1014, creates a licensing system for plant-touching businesses, including growers, processors, transporters, testing labs, and provisioning centers and dispensaries, the Detroit Free Press reported. State business licenses would cost $5,000 annually. The measures would also formally legalize edibles, establish a seed-to-sale tracking system, enact a two-year prison penalty for selling MMJ without a license, and place medical marijuana regulation under the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards.

<h2>NORTH DAKOTA</h2>
A medical marijuana initiative will appear on North Dakota’s November 8 ballot. Advocates submitted more than 17,600 signatures to the Secretary of State, who certified the initiative for the ballot in August. Measure 5, known as the North Dakota Compassionate Care Act, would allow patients with a qualifying condition and a doctor’s recommendation to access medical marijuana from a state-licensed compassion center. Patients living farther than 40 miles from a compassion center will be able to grow up to eight plants at home. To participate in the program, patients would apply to the Department of Health for a registry identification card by submitting an application, a fee, and a written certification from a doctor who confirms the patient has a qualifying condition.

<h2>OHIO</h2>
Ohio’s medical marijuana law went into effect last month. On September 8 Ohio agencies could officially begin writing and adopting rules for medical cannabis businesses. The state’s new regulatory framework brings protections for qualified medical marijuana patients. Under the law’s “affirmative defense,” patients will no longer be subject to criminal conviction for possessing marijuana if they meet certain requirements. The affirmative defense provides limited, temporary protections for patients while the formal program rolls out. It requires a signed letter from a licensed physician, including information about the patient and the medical condition treated. The protections do not apply to the cultivation or sale of marijuana.

<h2>PENNSYLVANIA</h2>
Since Pennsylvania’s Medical Marijuana Act (Act 16) went into effect on May 17, 2016, the Department of Health has been working to implement the new law. To this point, it has created regulations regarding — and accepted applications for — the safe harbor letter program, which provides legal protections for those caring for minor patients when they administer medical marijuana. In August, the department released a draft of temporary regulations regarding growers and processors and asked for public comments. The department also announced a public survey for patients and caregivers, which allows individuals to provide input on the application process and the financial hardship program.

<h2>MARYLAND</h2>
In August, Maryland’s medical marijuana commission voted to grant preliminary approval to 15 growers and 15 processors who applied earlier in the year. The decision regarding which applicants would be approved was based on a scoring system provided by the Towson University Regional Economic Studies Institute, which processed the applications. The selected applicants will proceed with financial and background checks before obtaining licenses. The commission was only permitted to give preliminary approval to 15 growers; there was no limit to the number of processors they could approve, but they opted to only approve 15 to maintain consistency.

[one_half]
2-½ cups all-purpose flour
1 cup unsalted butter, softened room temperature (cannabis butter) 
¾ cup white sugar 
1 egg 
2 oz. liquid egg white or egg white 
1 tsp. pure vanilla extract 
2 Tbsp. chopped rosemary (finely chopped) 
¾ tsp. kosher salt 
2 tsp. orange zest oil (Amoretti.com) or orange zest 
Use Splenda for a finishing touch before putting in oven

[/one_half]

[one_half_last]
<h3>DIRECTIONS</h3>
1. Preheat oven to 350° degrees. Using paddle attachment, mix butter and sugar in a mixing bowl to light and fluffy texture, about 2 minutes. Add egg/egg whites, orange zest oil (Amoretti.com) or orange zest and vanilla on reduced speed. 

2. Add flour, rosemary, and salt, mix to combine. Halve the dough and roll into a log using plastic wrap and put into the fridge to solidify for baking.

3. Once solid, slice into ¼-inch rounds and top with Splenda – you will need to work fast if the cookies become too hot and melt you have to put into the fridge for about 15 minutes to get solid again so they don't spread during baking. Bake cookies for 8-10 minutes depending on size.

[/one_half_last]


<h3>VARIATIONS:</h3>

Add 2 tsp. pumpkin spice
Add 1/2 tsp. cinnamon

Add 3 oz. cocoa powder and reduce all-purpose flour by 3 oz.

Add 3 oz. chopped dried cranberry
Add 2 tsp. orange zest oil or orange zest

Other fun ideas: Make an apple pie flavor using dried apples 
and 2 oz. brown sugar  



<p style="font-size:12px; color:#cecece"><em>Please remember when cooking with medicinal cannabis you are cooking with a medicine and the medicine amount and portions of the food ingested should always be taken into consideration. Always start out with small portions or doses and wait 30 minutes to an hour before eating any additional portions of food that has been medicated.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Justin Alexander</h4>
<p>It seems as if right now everyone is talking about dabs -- highly concentrated extracted doses of cannabis inhaled from an intimidating-looking glass device known as a rig. </p>
<p>Utilizing a super-potent dab, extracted by either CO2 or butane, reduces the need and time that goes into smoking flower or rolling a joint. Terms for these concentrates—referring to their consistencies—include everything from live resin, cake batter and budder to shatter, crumble or oil, with new ones popping up all the time. </p>
<p>Dab products comprise the largest sector of the cannabis concentrates market, says Kynd Cannabis Company's Ryan Clendenin. “Oftentimes, heavy flower smokers who are first-time dabbers have the feeling of being “high” for the first time…again,” Clendenin says. “While the high-potency of dab products is appealing to many consumers with higher tolerances, dabbing is actually an extremely healthful and convenient method of dosing for cannabis patients who are in need of immediate relief from chronic ailments without the potentially harmful effects that come from combusting plant materials.”Despite the complicated aesthetics, industry experts agree that there isn’t a more effective method for delivering immediate relief for ailments. </p>
<p>“The demand [for concentrates] is increasing because the market in Nevada is starting to mature and experiment a little,” says Ronan McConnon of Kabunky Concentrates. Previously the only thing you could buy was flower or terrible  dirty black market hash. Now the quality of concentrates has improved significantly and almost anybody that tries concentrates can taste the difference and feel the difference as well.” </p>
<p>Curious to give it a try and see what all the fuss is about? Check out a rig and a sampling of dabs available in the Las Vegas market.</p>

<h3>THE RIG</h3>
<p>Get started on a dabbing adventure with Dr. Dabber’s Boost eRig, Budder Cutter and Honey Mat. This low-heat system creates a thick, potent vapor that is smooth and flavorful. And since every terpene is unique in its therapeutic benefits, the flavors it produces, and sensitivity to heat, there are numerous unique vaporization points. The temperature at which you dab or vaporize concentrates can greatly affect the flavor profile and the synergy created between concentrated cannabinoids and terpenes.</p>
<p>“Our low-heat technology ensures optimal terp flavor and exceptional performance,” explains Dr. Dabber’s Johnray Strickland. “Knowing which temperature to heat your concentrates to, however, is a crucial detail and can be the difference between experiencing delicious flavors and profound effects or tasting the burnt disappointment from temperatures too hot to vaporize effectively. </p>
<p>Temperature control is so important for dabbing because of terpenes, which are the compounds in cannabis that give the plant its unique smell. Although cannabinoids are also extremely sensitive to temperatures, THC and other cannabinoids are odorless, so each strain’s compelling fragrance depends on which terpenes predominate.”</p>
<h3>MASTER KUSH LIVE RESIN SHATTER, THE+SOURCE</h3>
<p>Master Kush Live Resin Shatter contains flower grown by The+Source and then turned into a concentrate by Moxie. Live resin is a form of shatter or BHO (butane hash oil). The flower is fresh, not dried and cured, thus more of the delightful forest-like flavor of the Kush comes through.</p>
<p>At 75.5 percent THC, after a dab of Master Kush you will feel as relaxed as you do when waking up from a nap—without the fog commonly associated with an Indica strain. It is both a body and a head high but the mind snaps easily back into activity mode. Master Kush is recommended for those who need anti-inflammatory and anti-insomnia medicine. It also simulates appetite and is an anti-convulsive and anti-depressant.</p>
<p>With new products coming out all the time, The+Source currently has over 60 concentrates, the concentrate experience has become easier and more effective for patients. </p>
<p>“We are seeing an increase in the demand for concentrates,” says Chris Vickers, general manager of The+Source. “Patients are starting to realize it’s healthier than smoking dried cannabis. The effects typically last longer compared to other products and they’re cost efficient.” </p>
<h3>WI-FI O.G. LIVE RESIN, MOXIE 710</h3>
<p>Short for White Fire O.G., this hybrid strain produces a heavy sedative feeling. Its consistency resembles “cake badder” (as it is referred to at Moxie LV) because the live resin has a smooth, creamy appearance. </p>
<p>Sweet and fruity with earthy notes, at 77.4 percent THC/0.17 percent CBD, Wi-Fi O.G. helps to power through ailments including chronic pain, loss of appetite, stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>“It is much easier to take one small dab than to go through the whole process of rolling a joint or smoking a pipe,” says Moxie’s Michael Tulimero. “Concentrates also vaporize instead of combust which saves your lungs from unnecessary abuse as well. The future of dabbing is in the terpenes. It is getting easier every day to study the effects of various strains and the terpene modulation that they create based on the entourage effect. This should lead to a better understanding of the plant’s effects on a broader scope.”</p>
<p>Specializing in concentrates and with the goal of driving the scientific use of cannabis, Moxie has been developing cultivation and extraction procedures for the past two years. They have also partnered with universities abroad to seek federal funding, where available, to study and develop new therapies derived from the cannabis plant.</p>
<h3>KABUNKY CONCENTRATES, NEVADA MEDICAL MARIJUANA DISPENSARY </h3>
<p>“Shatter is typically very stable, cracks like glass and if it’s good is light yellow and translucent,” says Ronan McConnon, laboratory manager of Kabunky Concentrates. “It is my preferred consistency as it is very easy to dab and you can pick out a good shatter just by looking at it.”</p>
<p>At the end of a stressful day, turn to the Mix Master, a go-to for ease of mind with a floaty high that promotes relaxation and comes in at 85.33 mg/g. On the other hand, Grape Ape Live Resin, a strong Indica, soothes physical pain, offering a body buzz and relief for joint aches with a THC level of 77.45 percent. “The high levels of Bisabolol in the terpene profile give a distinct giddy body high,” McConnon says. </p>
<p>All raw materials for Kabunky extracts—which come in crumble, shatter and live resin—are sourced from its in-house grow. Mix Master is a blend of strains including Cherry Diesel, Mammoth, Casey Jones, and Grape Stomper; and Grape Ape Live Resin is made from fresh frozen raw material.</p>
<p>“If the concentrate is made with fresh frozen raw material, it is considered live resin,” McConnon says. “Fresh frozen means it was cut down and then frozen immediately. Live resin will always have more terpenes
in it than its cured hash counterpart because terpenes are volatile and evaporate. By extracting material when it’s fresh, the terpenes do not have the opportunity to evaporate.” </p>
<p>McConnon says Mix Master is Kabunky’s first attempt at a customized blend. “We extracted the four strains at peak freshness and produced a shatter that not only has excellent color, but also tastes great,” McConnon relays. “The Grape Ape live resin was so beautiful after the extraction that I couldn't allow it to be whipped into crumble. Its clarity and aroma needed to be locked into a shatter.”</p>
<h3>SOUR DIESEL/RINGO’S GIFT #1 DAB SAP, KYND CANNABIS COMPANY</h3>
<p>It might be the perfect mix: the energetic sativa Sour Diesel tested at 29.59 percent THC blended with the therapeutic 37.74 percent CBD-rich Ringo’s Gift #1, known for its relaxing and anti-inflammatory properties. This Dab Sap—the term Kynd uses to brand its extractions—promotes alertness and focus, while also relieving anxiety and depression. </p>
<p>“Kynd Dab Sap is 100 percent cannabis hash oil extracted in a research-grade closed loop system using CO2 as a supercritical fluid,” says Kynd’s Extractions Manager Ryan Clendenin. “The oil is then winterized/filtered with lab grade ethanol for purity and blended to the perfect viscosity, capturing and preserving all the best aspects of the plant for patient consumption.”</p>
<p>Ranging in color from amber-red to golden-honey, Kynd Dab Saps come in many different flavors and blends including LAOG, LAOG/Ringo’s Gift #1, Ghost OG, MTF and Gorilla Glue #4. Cadillac Purple, Critical Kush, Chemdawg and more Ringo #1 blends are on the horizon.</p>
<p>“Kynd Dab Saps are extracted from large batches of whole plant material to provide the full spectrum of plant benefits,” Clendenin says. “We strive to achieve truly medicinal grade extractions, complete with all the plant’s available cannabinoids, terpenes, flavonoids, and other botanical compounds. We ensure quality measures and constant analysis of the oil in its varying stages on its path to becoming the perfect hash oil.”</p>
<p>Kynd Dab Sap is the only CO2 dab product of its kind and the company brings the benefits of CO2 extracted medicine to the world of BHO shatters, waxes, crumbles, butters, and live resins. “Many CO2 dabs are messy, runny, and often delivered in plastic syringes that can leave mainstream cannabis oil consumers baffled when it comes time to consume their meds,” Clendenin says. </p>
<p>Kynd has developed CO2 oil that was designed for dabbing and aimed at solving the problem of making CO2 dabs as reliable, flavorful, and as attractive as the more popular BHO-based oils.</p>
<h3>SUICIDE SAP, KANNABIS </h3>
<p>Equal parts Indica and Sativa, Suicide Sap from Kannabis offers a cerebral, uplifting sensation, without paranoia or couch lock. Made of flower from The Grove’s master grower, it is a hybrid with Afgoo, OG Grape Krypt, Star Killer and Strawberry Chem that combines to a 79.36 percent THC count.</p>
<p>“We named [it] Suicide Sap because of the great mix of strains that I pulled together for this,” says Robbie Wright, head of production for Kannabis. “This is strictly an ethanol-based extract, but I do some pretty cool things during the extraction and winterization process so I can maximize the flavor and terpene profile. No butane, and not even CO2. Most people would not consider an ethanol extract to hold up against a butane or CO2 oil, but I definitely have methods to make it happen and taste great with great potency.”</p>
<p>The flavor is eclectic with notes of floral and candy— each strain’s own terpenes are distilled out and reintroduced at the end of the process to ensure they are all present. 
Wright says the inconvenience of the dab consumption is balanced out by the quality. “People are well-versed in the art of dabbing now,” he says “But, it still sort of remains a method of intake that is usually done at your house. It’s not a convenient way to vaporize your medicine with the equipment needed, but it’s certainly very effective and a favorite for most. The future of dabbing will definitely need to move towards making it more convenient to do. People don’t need to walk around with a rig and blowtorch. Dabbing has a long way to go before you’ll see people pulling out dab rigs in public to take their medicine.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>THE TWISTS AND TURNS OF  TRAVELING WITH MARIJUANA</title>
		<link>https://elevatenv.com/the-twists-and-turns-of-traveling-with-marijuana/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Riana Durrett, Connor & Connor</h4>
<p>Medical marijuana is legal in Nevada. That is clear. However, what may be less clear is when and where traveling with marijuana is legal. For example, can a patient transport marijuana from one state where it is legal to another state where it is also legal? Can a patient consume products in their vehicle? What about federal land within the state of Nevada? Below, we explore some of the rules surrounding travel and marijuana and look at some of the interesting developments in other states. </p>
<h3 class="page-header">Can I transport my legally purchased marijuana from one state where the product is legal to another state that has legalized it?</h3>
<p>Okay, we started out with an easy one here. You guessed it, the answer is: no! Transporting marijuana via any form of transportation across state lines is still federally illegal and is illegal under Nevada’s state law as well. Under the Controlled Substance Act, possession of marijuana is illegal, but the “Cole Memo” (memorandum issued by the United States Attorney General on August 29, 2013) deprioritizes enforcement action against those people complying with their state’s medical marijuana laws. However, the Cole Memo specifically states that the federal government’s enforcement priorities will include prosecution for diversion of marijuana from a state where marijuana is legal to another state.  </p>
<h3 class="page-header">Can I mail marijuana to myself or to another person?</h3>
<p>No. I imagine this does happen on occasion, but you are definitely taking the risk of getting arrested and prosecuted. According to “The Legalization of Marijuana in Colorado: Impact Report” released in 2015 by the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Area (“HIDTA”), “From 2010 – 2014, the total pounds of marijuana seized from U.S. packages mailed from Colorado has increased 722 percent from 57 to 470 pounds.”  Further, between 2010 and 2014, the number of states destined to receive marijuana mailed from Colorado increased from 10 to 38. It is clear that the mail is being monitored and it is not permitted to mail marijuana. </p>
<h3 class="page-header">How do I properly dispose of marijuana if I’m leaving the state? </h3>
<p>There are no specific laws in Nevada regarding disposal of unused marijuana. However, you can look at Nevada’s local ordinances on how businesses must dispose of marijuana to help ensure unused marijuana is not accessed by someone who is not supposed to have it.  The local ordinances require various measures, which mostly entail mixing the unused product with something that will render it unusable (like kitty litter) until it becomes unrecognizable. </p>
<p>The Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment suggests that tourists leaving the state of Colorado should dispose of their unused marijuana where it is not visible to the public and in a sealed container, such as an empty jar.  You should also make sure unused marijuana does not enter the public water system. Similarly, Nevadans and tourists to Nevada should ensure that unused marijuana is not left in hotels, rental cars, or any place where it can be accessed by anyone other than the person who legally purchased it. </p>
<p>Some Colorado airports have installed boxes specifically for disposal of unused marijuana before someone boards an airplane. Smart move, but since we do not yet have those in Nevada, be sure to dispose of unused marijuana before getting to the airport. </p>
<h3 class="page-header">Can I use medical marijuana in my vehicle? </h3>
<p>No. Don’t do it for several reasons. First, if you ingest marijuana in your vehicle then you will likely be over the 5ng limit for THC and will therefore be in violation of Nevada’s law against being in actual physical control while under the influence of marijuana, whether or not you are actually driving and whether or not you are impaired. Second, NRS 453A.300 prohibits public consumption of medical marijuana. You can drive with your marijuana products in the vehicle, but keep them in the opaque packaging the dispensary provided and place them away from public view. The trunk is the most advisable. </p>
<h3 class="page-header">What if I travel onto federal land while within the state of Nevada?</h3>
<p>Marijuana is, of course, still illegal federally and even possession violates the Controlled Substance Act. There have been prosecutions throughout the United States for possession of marijuana in national parks. According to the HIDTA: Impact Report, referenced above, “An increasing number of visitors to Yellowstone National Park are being prosecuted for possession [of] small amounts of medical and recreational pot, which remains illegal on federal land.” Park rangers attribute this increasing trend to ignorance of federal law and the growing prevalence of legal marijuana, including neighboring Colorado.  </p>
<p>The Ninth Circuit recently ruled that the federal government cannot prosecute individuals who possess or use medical marijuana in compliance with a state’s medical marijuana program (United States v. McIntosh, August 2016). This does not prevent a prosecution for use or possession of marijuana on federal land, or a national park, because state law generally does not apply to those areas.  Whether or not state law applies will actually depend on a complicated legal doctrine, so it is best to assume that the federal government has exclusive authority and can prosecute for medical marijuana possession and use. In addition, the Cole Memo, referenced above, states that prosecution for use or possession of marijuana on federal property will continue to remain a priority for the federal government.  </p>
<p>Given marijuana’s federal status as a Schedule I drug, possession and travel with it can be complicated. It is important to understand your rights. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Deanna Rilling</h4>
<p>On the campaign trail, many pundits assess a candidate’s likability by pondering if they’re the type of person with whom you could grab a beer. However, as more states across America move toward cannabis legalization, perhaps a new gauge for relatability could lie in a presidential hopeful’s willingness to light up with constituents. 
</p>
<p>As Question 2 in Nevada proposes fully legalizing recreational marijuana, only one candidate on the ballot in the Silver State has firsthand experience with cannabis and the desire to take the cause nationwide: The Libertarian party’s nominee Gary Johnson. (Green party candidate Jill Stein does not have ballot access in Nevada and write-ins are not allowed.)</p>
<p>The former GOP governor of New Mexico from 1995 to 2003, Johnson was cool, calm and collected before his packed Las Vegas rally at the Foundry in the SLS on August 18. Flanked by his running mate, former Republican Governor Bill Weld of Massachusetts, the #TeamGov duo met with elevate to share why Nevadans should consider them for president and vice president this November. </p>
<p>“We are, in my opinion, representative of most Americans—most Americans being fiscally responsible and socially inclusive,” says Johnson. “Keep government out of the bedroom, keep government out of my pocketbook. That’s most people. And it’s not being represented by the Democrats,and it’s not being represented by the Republicans.”</p>
<p>Personal freedom and liberty are cornerstones of Gary Johnson’s platform. Though he is abstaining from cannabis use while on the campaign trail and would if he were to be elected, it is at the forefront of policies he’d reform immediately if he were to win. “It is a pledge on both of our parts to deschedule marijuana the first day in office,” Johnson says of himself and Weld</p>
<p>“We need to legalize marijuana in the United States,” he reiterates during his Las Vegas rally. “We have the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world, and I refuse to believe we are any less law-abiding in this country than any other country. It has to do with the war on drugs. There are tens of millions of Americans that are convicted felons in this country that, but for our drug laws, would otherwise be tax-paying, law-abiding citizens.”</p>
<p>Though mainstream media rarely gives coverage to Johnson, internet-savvy millennials have found their way to supporting his campaign. In August a national poll by Investor’s Business Daily found Johnson ahead of both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump with 35 percent support in the 18-24 age bracket. But it’s the overall national poll requirement of 15 percent that Johnson needs to reach to make it onto the debate stage that is still up in the air (as of press time).</p>
<p>Johnson and Weld aren’t strictly running as pro-cannabis candidates. Immigration is another hot topic as a result of the county’s robust Hispanic population at 27 percent, or 14th in the nation according to the Pew Hispanic Center. Regarding that hot-topic wall on the Mexico border the Republican candidate wants? “We should not build a wall across the border,” Johnson says. “We build a wall across the border, the president of Mexico is going to stand on the opposite side of that wall and say, ‘President of the United States, take that wall down!’” </p>
<p>He continues, “We embrace immigration. We think immigration for this country is really a good thing. We’re a country of immigrants and we should make it easy as possible for someone that wants to come into this country and work, to be able to get a work visa. We’re not the deporters here. We don’t want to break up families and the dreamers.” Adds Weld, “We want the dreamers to be able to go to college. We’re on their side.” </p>
<p>Speaking of education, Nevada recently had the unfortunate distinction of being named the worst in the country based on ACT scores, with only about 10 percent of students being college-ready. Johnson is a proponent of school choice and letting Nevada make the decisions for its schools. </p>
<p>As far as those with college aspirations, Team Gov has an approach as well. “I think the highly-expensive, four-year, Ivy-clad bricks-and-mortar education may be a thing of the past before too long,” says Weld. “I think online education is a way to reach a lot of people who can’t afford to take six months or two years off to go to get their associate’s degree, so I think government support of online education would be good, government-supported partnerships between colleges and employers... There are other partnerships with universities where the government will sponsor your kids and have no student debt if they agree to work in the public sector for three years. There are other things that can be done to just make sure jobs are available. Working your way through college used to be a very common proposition and there’s no shame in that either. It’s a multi-faceted approach.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s important to point out the reason for the student debt crisis,” adds Johnson. “The reason for the high cost of college tuition is government-guaranteed student loans. Government is interfering in the marketplace, there’s a skewed supply and demand because of guaranteed government student loans, but I think we’re both open to legislation that might cap interest rates. I think students have been sold a bill of goods and if we can bailout Wall Street, I think we can do something for students.”</p>
<p>Johnson looks toward the sharing economy as the way of the future, i.e. through companies like Airbnb or Uber and Lyft. “Eliminating the middle man, allowing for you to provide your goods, your services directly to the end user and the end user pays less money, you make more money, that’s the model of the future.” He adds, “Here in Las Vegas there has to be all sorts of opportunity to rent your place out to make some extra money.”</p>
<p>Money is definitely one area where Governors Johnson and Weld have a proven track record. “Neither of us serving full terms as governor, in each of our respective states, raised taxes one penny between us, not one penny,” says Johnson. “Count on us to support lower taxes, to support simplifying taxes.” Johnson promises that he and Weld would submit a balanced budget to Congress in the first 100 days. “If we don’t balance the budget, we’re not going to be a country going forward. Our kids, our grandkids, ourselves, we’re going to suffer the consequences of what is going to be runaway inflation to go along with the fact that we continue to print more money to pay for what it is that we’re doing.” </p>
<p>In an election year filled with drama, scandal, conspiracy theories, divisiveness, and dissatisfaction with two-party options, many are looking for a different option and as he says in his commercials: “Just Google ‘Gary Johnson’ and find out.” </p>
<p>As far as critics who caution voting for a third party candidate in a swing state like Nevada is essentially a vote for Clinton or Trump (depending on the leaning of the outlet) or just wasted altogether, Johnson presents an alternate point. “What I would say is a wasted vote is voting for somebody you don’t believe in,” he says. “Come election time, I think there’s going to be a lot of conjecture over, ‘Are you going to waste your vote on either Hillary or Trump?’” Adds Weld, “If you believe in us, don’t waste your vote elsewhere.” </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>FORGETTING THE FEAR AND UNDERSTANDING THE FACTS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Riana Durrett</h4>
<p>Sometimes when I’m getting ready for work in the morning or on a drive across town, I find myself making a mental list of everything in the world that needs to be fixed when suddenly a fear washes over me: What if marijuana becomes legal on November 8th and more and more kids start using it? What if it becomes popular among kids and they get desensitized to it and start doing more serious drugs? As the Executive Director of Nevada Dispensary Association and supporter of Question Two, am I on a trajectory to increase marijuana use among children? </p>
<p>Each time I have this internal debate, I come back to all the reasons I support legalizing marijuana: </p>
<p>1. Marijuana is currently used by teenagers and even younger children at an alarming rate. 
2. It is the unwarranted fear of the slippery slope that has kept a substance less harmful than alcohol illegal for so long.
3. We can do better at reducing youth use of marijuana by removing marijuana from the black market, where kids are currently purchasing it.   
</p>
<p>I am a mom of two young boys and have a niece who lives with me every summer. Like all moms, I am concerned about drug use in our country and will do anything to protect my kids from experiencing the struggles so many Americans face when it comes to drug use. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, "in 2012, 13.2 percent of youths aged 12 to 17 indicated that they had been approached by someone selling drugs in the past month."1 Peers have such a strong influence over youth that a better indicator of whether a teenager will start smoking is whether their friends smoke, rather than whether their parents smoke.2</p>
<p>But, naturally, there are two sides to the coin if Question Two passes. One benefit is that adults over the age of 21 will be able to use marijuana with myriad benefits to the State and our communities. Benefits include tax money moving into the State’s economy as well as into education and conservation of criminal justice resources that should go towards more serious crimes. In addition, citizens, such as veterans who fear losing their federal benefits, will have access to marijuana for medical treatment without being required to register with the State. </p>
<p>An extensive report released by RCG Economics and the Marijuana Policy Group estimates that the state will receive a total of $464 million in the first seven years of legalization, which breaks down to $257.4 million in sales and use tax, $147.1 million in excise tax, $47.2 million in license fees, $3.5 million in application fees, $521,000 in Nevada Commerce Tax and $8.3 million in payroll tax. </p>
<p>The other side of the coin is that the marijuana industry and Nevadans must promote adult-only use of marijuana and we must embrace the opportunity to reduce use of marijuana by our youth, with the possibility of this reduction extending to other substances. With more than 47 percent of Americans having tried marijuana in their lifetime, there is no denying that the prohibition on marijuana is a policy that has failed in the United States.3</p>
<p>So, what is the real impact of legalizing marijuana and what are the real opportunities? </p>
<p>In June of this year, the Nevada Dispensary Association organized a trip to Denver, Colorado for legislators, regulators and leaders from Nevada’s medical marijuana industry. Senator Patricia Farley of District 8 was in attendance and put her focus on youth prevention, funding for drug treatment and the impact of legalized marijuana on public health. </p>
<p>It never occurred to me before that trip that legalized marijuana could provide an opportunity to improve overall public health in Nevada and not just reduce black market sales of marijuana. Senator Farley approached the trip with just that goal in mind. When describing her efforts Farley said, “How can Nevada harness the opportunities legalized marijuana provides to not just reduce black market sales of marijuana, but to raise youth awareness, reduce drug use among youth, and increase resources for drug treatment?” </p>
<p>Prior to the trip to Denver, I was unaware that Nevada’s schools have no uniform drug awareness program. With the D.A.R.E. program found to be ineffective, shouldn’t we be trying to reach our youth and prevent drug abuse through some other program throughout the State?4 Of course, as parents we are all responsible for our own children, but our children are involved in a larger community and that community is lacking in public awareness, youth prevention, and drug abuse treatment. I am eagerly awaiting the 2017 Legislative Session when Senator Farley pursues support for youth prevention and drug treatment programs, which could potentially be funded from the economic boon resulting from Question Two’s passage.  </p>
<p>Senator Farley is confident that if the youth prevention measure she is sponsoring passes during the upcoming legislative session, Nevada will lead the nation in its efforts to prevent youth from using marijuana and much more harmful substances.</p>
<p>“I have spent the better part of the year speaking with elected officials and leaders from other states, as well as educators, to gather information on the best approach to youth prevention,” explained Senator Farley. “With the help of Roseman University and John Hudak, a fellow with Brookings Mountain West, Nevada is going to go from having absolutely no youth prevention program for our children to having the best in the nation.” </p>
<p>So, the next time the fear starts to creep in and I start to wonder if my work with the Nevada Dispensary Association is tantamount to working for Philip Morris, I will think of two pieces of news I received recently that reminded me legalizing recreational marijuana is an affront to drug abuse and drug addiction. First, a study was released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which concluded that marijuana use among teenagers is currently decreasing, while the number of states legalizing marijuana is increasing. This is supported by a Health Kids Survey commissioned by the State of Colorado that concluded that youth use decreased by 2-3 percent once marijuana was legalized. </p>
<p>The second piece of news that confirms to me that legalizing marijuana is the right thing to do is that the producer of Fentanyl recently made a large campaign contribution to oppose marijuana legalization. Fentanyl is a powerful opioid painkiller that is up to 50 times more potent than heroin. Disturbingly, a synthetic form of this painkiller has been illegally produced and laced into heroine in the past and is now being sold on its own. Why would the producer of a painkiller (the real painkiller, not the synthetic one available on the street) be opposed to legalizing marijuana?   </p>
<p>If anyone asks me, as a mother, if I support legalizing marijuana, my answer is unequivocally: Yes. As a mother, an aunt, an attorney, a Nevadan and as the Executive Director of Nevada Dispensary Association, I will vote in favor of passing Question Two. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some cannabis proponents predict that if Question 2 does not pass and cannabis is not legalized for adult use, “the Nevada medical cannabis market will become the Salton Sea of cannabis markets. If it doesn’t pass, it’s going to be devastating for the industry. Bankruptcy lawyers are going to make all the money. It is exactly what we don’t want to see happen in Nevada,” explains Leslie Bocskor, managing partner of Electrum Partners. “The effect on the patients will be far less availability, far less variety, no innovation taking place to provide anything, and it will just be brutal.” </p>
<p>Bocskor, who is the founding chairman of the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association, continues, “The variety starts to go out of the shops. You don’t see 10 or 20 different strains, you see five or three, it becomes sort of like New Jersey. You will see the variety go away. The only thing that will sell will be the things people know they can make money on. The high-CBD strains will go away, which are some of the most therapeutic, because they don’t make as much money and they take longer to grow.” </p>
<p>While Bocskor predicts patients will suffer, he notes that the black market will thrive. “California will most likely go rec this November, Arizona might go rec, too, so we will be an oasis of medical only. The black market will thrive, you will guarantee a black market. You will guarantee that the business gets crushed in Nevada. It’s not going to be a happy outcome,” Bocskor explains. “I am going to say all but five dispensaries will have to shut their doors six days a week. There will probably be five that will be able to stay open full weeks and the rest will shut down or cut back the days that they are open. </p>
<p>“I don’t want to be the bearer of bad news but I don’t see a way to do the calculations in any other way that works. If we look at the actual numbers and look at what’s going to happen as people compete just to try and stay in business, prices are going to go down and it’s going to be a race to the bottom. That’s going to cause people to shut down and wait,” finishes Bocskor. </p>
<p>Nevada’s dispensaries owners are much more upbeat in their prognostications about the medical cannabis industry if Question 2 doesn’t get the votes necessary to pass. “I think we will see the medical marijuana industry in Nevada grow with or without Q2 -- with Q2 the growth curve is steeper, without Q2 it will continue to grow just without as high of a rate,” forecasts David Goldwater, partner at Inyo Fine Cannabis Dispensary, which is celebrating its one-year anniversary this month. “I am not concerned for my business, but there are others in the industry who are counting on Q2 passage to remain in the business or to get in the industry. We designed our business model and applied for all of our licenses based on moderate demand in the medical marijuana program. Those who made a business plan anticipating adult use, obviously, will be disappointed if Q2 fails.” </p>
<p>Dispensary operator Brenda Gunsallus also took a more moderate approach with regard to Sahara Wellness’ business plan. “We were not the people who went into the business expecting to make a lot of money. That’s not why we got in the business in the first place. We have started a lot of businesses so we knew it would take years to get our investment back. When you have $2 million in just the dispensary, and $4 or $5 million in the cultivation, you don’t make that up overnight, it takes years and years. We were invested in people and helping people so that’s why we wanted to do it,” she explains of opening Sahara Wellness earlier this year.</p>
<p>Ben Sillitoe, CEO/General Manager of Oasis Medical Cannabis, sees a thriving future for medical cannabis in the Silver State. “Nevada’s medical marijuana industry will continue to grow at a steady pace now that the state has made it easier to become a patient by providing access to an online application system and having turnaround times of less than 48 hours. I think that we will actually see an increase in the rate of growth for the medical industry. We will eventually see about 45,000 patients in Las Vegas, and, at that point, I think the medical industry will stabilize.Some companies may not make it to that point if it’s only medical, but it will eventually become a thriving industry,” predicts Sillitoe.</p>
<p>Ironically Gunsallus would like to see Question 2 pass for the patients more than anyone else, noting many patients can’t afford to get their medical marijuana cards. “We will have to find a way to get older people cards. I know of a lot of elderly people who have cancer and they can’t sleep and have side effects from chemotherapy and they can’t afford to get their cards. I would like to find a way that if rec doesn’t pass, that as an industry we help people get their cards.”</p>
<p>Former political scientist and cannabis consultant Stephen McCamman agrees that easing restrictions and making patient cards more easily obtainable will help an industry that “will continue to limp along” if Q2 doesn’t pass. “If it doesn’t pass, what needs to happen is more conditions need to be listed as allowable. The process for getting a card needs to be streamlined and the cost of getting the card needs to be reduced. On top of that, the concept of reciprocity with other states needs to be advertised. There are lot of people in other medical states who don’t even know they can come to Las Vegas to use their card.”</p>
<p>More refined regulations for Nevada’s medical marijuana program is why cannabis advocate Julie Monteiro, who is a registered nurse and editor of Cannabis Nurses magazine, is hoping Question 2 doesn’t pass. “If it fails it will finally allow our legislators and lobbyists to focus on our medical bill that has been in existence for over 16 years. We still have so much to fix and mold with our current medical program,” Monteiro explains. “I feel our Nevada legislators have let our entire program suffer by not ironing these issues out for the last 16 years.</p>
<p>“A lot of people are not happy, they are frustrated, they want the medical marijuana program fixed first before convoluting it with a whole other program of putting recreational on top of it. The patients need help and they aren’t going to get that help if Q2 passes, in my professional opinion. I have seen it happen in Alaska, Washington and soon to be Colorado. I sat there when our legislators said in five years our medical program would be going by the wayside,” Monteiro explains of her stance.</p>
<p>“I have spent the better part of the year speaking with elected officials and leaders from other states, as well as educators, to gather information on the best approach to youth prevention,” explained Senator Farley. “With the help of Roseman University and John Hudak, a fellow with Brookings Mountain West, Nevada is going to go from having absolutely no youth prevention program for our children to having the best in the nation.” </p>
<p>Monteiro is not the only one who is concerned that Nevada’s medical marijuana program could become a thing of the past. “I think a lot of people are scared that if rec passes, the medical industry will somehow disappear and I think they have good reason to fear that. But our industry is committed to maintaining its existence as a medical industry alongside the future adult-use industry so, hopefully, if it does pass, nothing will change for patients,” says Sillitoe.</p>
<p>Even if Nevada’s medical cannabis program does go by the wayside, it will have left behind some strong regulatory measures that will benefit recreational users. “Nevada’s standards of testing are leading the nation right now. The safest cannabis in the U.S. is available in Nevada,” says Bocskor. “If rec passes, you will see that continue to go forward and become even better. It will lead to the breaking of the black market, which will remove the temptation for patients not to go to the black market. The real issue with the black market is not that it is cheaper, it is that it’s not tested and you don’t know what fungicide, what herbicide, what microbial infestation or what contamination of heavy metals is present or what you are dealing with. That lack of testing in the black market will encourage patients to go to the dispensaries.”</p>
<p>If Q2 passes Bocskor predicts good things for patients. “It will be great for the patients on an ongoing basis. Home grow will be brought back. Once the industry is up and running and everybody is able to function and it’s a real market than the industry won’t feel threatened by home grow because they will realize it’s not a threat. If you look at every other market, like Colorado or Oregon, it’s not harming the industry at all. They will eventually get it back.”</p>
<p>But home grows is not the only thing patients will benefit from, according to Bocskor. “The variety available to patients will be enormous because Nevada will become a hotbed of innovation in developing new product categories, doing research on the therapeutic effects of different things, and the first patients to get access to this will be Nevada’s. Nevada will get the benefit of all of the business being done here,”he notes.</p>
<p>It will not just be Nevada’s patients who benefit from the passage of Q2. According to the Economic and Fiscal Benefits Analysis prepared by Las Vegas-based RCG Economics in conjunction with the Marijuana Policy Group (MPG), a regulated, adult-use marijuana industry in Nevada will generate more than $1.1 billion in overall economic activity in the state related to the adult-use marijuana market.</p>
<p>The state’s educational system will see a big portion of that windfall. The Economic and Fiscal Benefits Analysis notes that revenue projections are more than $60 million in excise and sales tax revenue annually, including approximately $20 million per year for Nevada schools.</p>
<p>“It would provide the most tax revenue we have seen for the schools and the educational system in Nevada. I can’t find anything to compete with it historically. It would generate tax revenue that would compete with gaming and mining. We are 49th in the nation in education and this will provide more money to get better educators, to give teachers the money to buy supplies that they are now coming out of pocket for, and to reduce classroom sizes from 40 students to a more manageable 20 students.  The effect on the youth of Nevada will be enormous, not to mention, once we have it regulated we are breaking the black market which will mean it will be just as hard to get cannabis as it is to get beer.”</p>
<p>Job creation is another positive that comes with the legalization of adult-use cannabis, according to Q2 supporters. “Job creation in Nevada has been a real problem since the economic collapse in ‘08/’09 and this is likely to be the number one job creator in Nevada once we pass this,” offers Bocskor. The Economic and Fiscal Benefits Analysis estimates approximately 3,300 jobs will 
be created directly in the adult-use marijuana industry and 6,200 jobs will be supported overall. </p>
<p>In the end, it will be up to the voters of Nevada to decide if the state will join Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and the District of Columbia and go rec or not -- which is not a done deal by any means. According to a Rasmussen Reports poll from July 26, 50 percent of voters polled said they’d vote for Question 2, with 41 percent opposed and nine percent undecided.</p>
<p>“At this point it’s too close to call, the thing that will determine the outcome will be strong democratic turnout and strong turnout of younger people,” offers McCamman. “The unknown is how much the opposition is going spend, but a worrisome sign is the number of politicians coming out against it. In summary, it’s too close to call.” </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>DMV VISITS NO LONGER NECESSARY DURING PATIENT APPLICATION PROCESS</h3>
<p>Nevada’s medical cannabis patients no longer need to visit the Department of Motor Vehicles for processing of their medical marijuana patient card. The Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health and the DMV have interfaced data systems so that patients’ cards will be mailed to them automatically. The Medical Marijuana Patient Online Registry (MPP) has a system in place to accommodate patients who currently have letters of approval, but who have not yet visited the DMV under the old rules. Patients with approval letters dated June 1, 2016 or later will get their cards in the mail. Patients with an approval letter dated May 31, 2016 or earlier will be contacted by the state.  </p>

<h3>PATIENT REGISTRATION AND PAYMENT NOW AVAILABLE ONLINE</h3>
<p>Applying, paying for and getting a medical marijuana approval are now available by using the Medical Marijuana Patient Online Registry (MPP). From the Registry homepage (go to http://dpbh.nv.gov and click to the Medical Marijuana Registry), patients can create their own accounts, scan in their driver’s license, and download and print their application. Patients are still required to secure a physician recommendation and sign the waiver and acknowledgment in the presence of a Notary Public. This process requires internet access, a computer, printer and scanner. When all pages of the application are complete, applicants can scan and upload them directly to the MMP portal for approval. Letters of approval may be provided in as little as 24 hours. Patients may print the letter for use in dispensaries until their card arrives in the mail. </p>

<h3>SEMINAR FOR PTSD SUFFERERS SET FOR OCTOBER 5TH</h3>
<p>The Grove dispensary is hosting an educational event called ‘Standing for Veterans’ on Wednesday, October 5th from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. at Laborers Union Hall, 4201 E. Bonanza Road. Those attending the free seminar will learn about research being conducted to find out how medical cannabis can help those who are suffering from PTSD. Speakers will include US Congresswoman Dina Titus, Nevada State Senator Pat Spearman, Roberto Pickering of the Battle Brothers Foundation, and Dr. Sue Sisley, PTSD researcher and medical director for the Grove. Please call 702.222.2362 for details and to register. </p>



<h3>NEW DISPENSARIES OPEN THROUGHOUT SILVER STATE</h3>
<p>Over the last few months, several new dispensaries have opened in Southern Nevada. Those include 
Blackjack Collective at 1800 Western Avenue, blackjackcollective.com; ShowGrow located at 4850 S. Fort Apache Road, showgrow.com; The Clinic Nevada, 4310 W. Flamingo Avenue, theclinicnevada.com; and Top Notch THC at 5630 N. Stephanie Street, topnotchthc.com.
In the northern part of the state, NuLeaf opened in Incline Village at 877 Tahoe Blvd., nuleafnv.com; and The Dispensary NV is now operating at 100 W. Plumb Lane in Reno, thedispensarynv.com. Reef dispensaries have now opened in Sparks at 195 East Glendale Avenue and the other is in Sun Valley at 5105 Sun Valley Blvd., reefdispensaries.com. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For over 20 years Julie Monteiro has worked in the medical field specializing in internal medicine, orthopedics, pediatric ER/trauma and adult ER, outpatient surgery, and pain management. Using her wealth of knowledge, Monteiro started Cannabis Nurses magazine a year ago. As the magazine celebrates its one-year anniversary this month, she shares the trials and tribulations of making the switch from healthcare provider to editor as well as creating a national platform to promote cannabis information and education.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">

It is the first for nurses -- we are the pioneers. The other nursing organizations won’t touch it yet due to it (cannabis) being Schedule I.

WHY WAS IT IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO START A CANNA NURSING PUBLICATION?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It was extremely important to try to provide evidenced-based research and education to our profession. I notice there is a gap of information every time I talk to anyone in our field, whether it’s a nurse or a physician, their reaction is that it’s great information but there’s no research to back it up. I thought to myself I know we have tons of research out there, I have read many, many studies, hundreds across the world, and it was important to have a place to be able to publish this for nurses to have easy access to education.

WHAT’S UNIQUE ABOUT CANNABIS NURSES MAGAZINE? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Anything we put into our magazine has to have evidence-based research. We take journal articles and regular research and put it into an easy-to-read format. We had the intention of promoting it to nurses first and that’s who was going to be picking it up, which they are and they absolutely love it. Even physicians, pharmacists, and other ancillary professionals have been reading it. But what has been happening is the public and the patients are picking up the magazine and they are able to read it because it’s in a very readable format.

WHAT HAS BEEN YOUR FAVORITE PART OF STARTING THE PUBLICATION?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I have been lecturing nationally, which has been a phenomenal experience. This platform has allowed me to meet physicians who are practicing with cannabis and are doing new research and through that they are being incorporated into our magazine. So their information is hot off the press. Knowledge is power. Cannabis is a very unique field of medicine and every single modality and practice that is out there can somehow fit into cannabis. A lot of people don’t understand the paradigm shift that is happening. Cannabis nursing is now a new topic that nurses aren’t just talking about, they are actually going out and doing it. They are getting educated first with a core curriculum and from there they take that knowledge back to their communities, whether they are in a legal state or not. We are planting seeds and they are growing and it’s having a ripple effect.

HOW HAS CANNABIS NURSES BEEN RECEIVED? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It has been extremely revered as a very good, reliable and well documented source for information. It’s a part of history. It’s a part of a movement. In fact, we are being inducted into the Southern Pueblo Library System in Colorado on October 4. That’s where we record history. I had no idea that this was the direction it would take. I needed to educate and couldn’t do it from the emergency room so this was a bigger platform to scream from to educate and inform people. I am just a conduit for information, I am just redirecting it. The education is out there, it’s just putting it in a place where people can easily access and understand it in simple layman’s terms.

HAS THE MAGAZINE BENEFITED PATIENTS?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFivetoo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Absolutely, without a doubt. I always encourage patients if they want to introduce something to their physician, bring it (the magazine) to them during a visit and encourage them to read the articles. And ask to discuss it on their return visit, which gives the physician the opportunity to read and digest it. I guarantee you once they read it, they will already be doing their research because they are critical thinkers and if they are proactive in their healthcare profession they will seek out the answer. And if they don’t, go find a new doctor. Do not stay with someone who is stuck in traditional medicine, they have to be on the cutting edge and understand that this is a method of treatment. Physicians usually have a change of heart and I think that’s the most impact I am making with medical providers.

		<title>MILITARY VETERAN AND CANCER SURVIVOR REPLACES 37 PRESCRIPTIONS WITH MEDICAL CANNABIS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was on four oxys a day. I was to the point where I couldn’t even take them they made me so ill and they gave those to me for five years. There isn’t a doctor in his right mind who would prescribe that,” explains 61-year-old Hollis Moon (not his real name). </p>
<p>Having been exposed to radiation resulting from 43 nuclear tests during a three-year stint he spent in the Army in the late ‘70s, Moon was diagnosed with stage 3 colon cancer in December of 2010. He had surgery in February 2011 to remove 18-1/2 inches of his colon which was followed by 12 rounds of chemotherapy. </p>
<p>Although he is currently cancer-free, Moon describes his current condition as “fair to poor, I am just dealing with a lot of post-cancer stuff. Overall, I have had sleep issues, depression issues, anxiety issues, but with the pain and sleep issues cannabis has been tremendously helpful.” </p>
<p>Moon explains that a lot of vets are using cannabis and it’s really helping. “I think you would find 80 percent usage (among vets) and I don’t think that’s a ridiculous estimate. But they are concerned about losing their benefits.”</p>
<p>Moon is not a complete stranger to cannabis. During his teen years Moon used cannabis but quit in his early 20s. After he was diagnosed with cancer Moon was reintroduced to cannabis by one of his son’s friends who had an aunt with cancer and was using medical cannabis. At first Moon was dismissive. </p>
<p>“I told him I could see where that would help somebody in the head, but I think people just use that for an excuse to get high,” Moon explains of his anti-cannabis viewpoint. “I was a little skeptical and I started reading about it and then 40 years later I had cancer and I still had the stigma where I didn’t believe in it.” </p>
<p>His son’s friend encouraged him to give it a try and left a joint for him. “It sat there for two days and every time I was able to get out of bed, I looked at that thing and thought I should really try that. After the second day I told my wife I am going to smoke that bad boy,” recalls Moon. “And honest to God, it was unbelievable. I enjoyed the buzz, don’t get me wrong, but the pain was gone, the anxiety was gone, the anger from the PTSD was gone and I was able to sleep for the first time in I don’t know how long. I got about four hours of sleep on it and for me to get two hours a day is a gift. That was all it took, I knew right then I had the cure-all for the side effects of chemotherapy.” </p>
<p>In 2011 Moon started using cannabis when he could, which was “about once every two weeks because I was 50 years old, where I am going to get it?” He was prescribed Marinol but the cost was prohibitive. With insurance it was $3100 for 30 pills and for generic the co-pay was $1300 for 30 pills. </p>
<p>About three years ago, Moon started consistently using cannabis and he noticed he “was able to get rid of various medications that had really bad side effects.” Eventually Moon replaced 37 prescriptions with medical cannabis. “Surprisingly enough I am no longer taking pain meds, just taking my blood pressure medicine, and I have one for cholesterol and one for incontinence. I just feel so much better after the marijuana than after the pills.” </p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“In some cases it’s a matter of life or death,” says former U.S. Marine Corps Corporal Roberto Pickering of passing Question #2 to regulate marijuana like alcohol on November 8th. Although Pickering’s statement sounds dramatic, he is referring to the statistic that 22 veterans commit suicide each day as a result of PTSD. </p>
<p>“A lot of veterans are coming back from the war with battle scars and they are being prescribed opiates to deal with it to manage their pain but as they heal, the opioid addition doesn’t go away, instead they develop an addiction and then they are dying on the streets as heroin addicts,” Pickering described of the nation’s war heroes. </p>
<p>Pickering advocates voting yes on Question #2 this month because it would allow safe access of cannabis for his military brethren. “Anything that chips away at this disgusting number of 22 veterans killing themselves each day, which is actually far lower than the actual number, would be welcome. I think that it is going to save a lot of lives, I really do. Access is everything, and that’s where it starts,” he opined.</p>

<h4>TAKING THE VA COCKTAIL</h4> 
<p>From the moment his VA doctor wrote him a prescription for the anti-psychotic Seroquel, Army veteran Boone Cutler lost complete control of his life. “It was at exactly that moment, it wasn’t in the war, it wasn’t when I got to Walter Reed, it wasn’t after I got blown up. It’s when I got that prescription of Seroquel and took it on top of Ambien, on top of chloral hydrate, on top of all these other things -- that was it, it was over for me. Why? Because that was the last time I had the ability to make decisions for myself.</p>
<p>“You are zombied out and because you are on all these drugs, guess what you never think about doing? Coming off all these drugs, because your day is spent managing them,” explained Cutler, who has a tattoo emblazoned across his right forearm that appropriately reads ‘take the pain’. “I don’t know who decided to put me in charge of my own medication with a head injury, memory loss and short-term memory issues, but it probably wasn’t the best idea. 
“I would lie down and wouldn’t be able to sleep and would take an Ambien and chloral hydrate. I would lie back down, wake up, completely forget that I took the Ambien and chloral hydrate, and dose again. One night I took four Ambien over a period of about five hours and drank a half a bottle of chloral hydrate. The next day I got up, changed my will and left everything to my dog, Buster.”</p>
<p>Christoper Lengyel, 28, also started on the VA cocktail for PTSD shortly after leaving the Army following four years of service. “At first, I didn’t know what was going on. No one talked about it. I didn’t know what it was. No one offered the warning signs of what PTSD was or talked about it in a way as to look for warning signs. After a couple of incidents that brought the situation to light, they immediately started putting me on anti-depressants. I have had four extensive joint surgeries so I was also on different opiates, oxy, Percocet, Seroquel,” relayed Lengyel. </p>
<p>“You name any of the sleeping and anti-anxiety pills and I was on them. Close to the time I was getting out of the military, it got to the point where these pills were destroying my body and I had to get an endoscopy because I was throwing up blood. I had severe ulcers in my stomach, and my kidney and liver enzyme numbers </p>
<p>were not good. I was well on the way to damaging my liver and kidneys from processing all of these pills,” Lengyel explained.</p>
<p>Former Marine John Millken, who has had 17 surgeries on both of his feet resulting from an IED blast in Afghanistan in 2009, was on opiates for half a decade. “When I first got hit I was immediately put on opiates and I didn’t get off of them for 5/1-2 years -- not one day. As soon as I would start going down on the pain meds, they would do another surgery and they would go back up again. I was figuring what the doctors were giving me was good stuff but it just ended up not being that way.” </p>
<p>Like the other veterans profiled in this story, Millken, 29, decided to wean himself off opiates. Their stories are all very similar to Millken’s. “I live in pain every day. I still have pain in my right foot, but my main motivation for coming off the opioids was I realized how much it had changed me, I could literally feel it draining the life out of me where I was getting weaker, and weaker each year. I went cold turkey, it was probably the worse month-and-a-half of my life to be completely honest. After getting off of the pain meds, it took about two or three months to even out and for a month straight I was puking every morning. It’s like being a heroin junkie going through withdrawal. Once I got past that, I could literally just feel my mind getting clearer and clearer as I got further and further away from that point.”</p>

<h4>FROM COCKTAILS TO CANNABIS</h4> 
<p>Pickering, 36, has been using cannabis medically for the last five years. It aided him in getting off the many pharmaceuticals he was taking as well as kicking alcohol. “It absolutely changed my life, I don’t drink alcohol anymore, I get a good night’s sleep, I am not aggressive, I am not angry. If you have the ability to get a good night’s rest and lower your anxiety levels, that’s pretty much a fix. It’s like giving a thirsty man a glass of water,” he noted of the cannabis tinctures and edibles he uses every night before bedtime.  </p>
<p>Lengyel started with CBD-based cannabis and RSO-style (Rick Simpson Oil) products. “Within three or four weeks I was able to reduce my anxiety attacks, get better sleep, and the overall day-to-day grind of being in crowds was curbed by using cannabis,” offered Lengyel, who also prefers tinctures, edibles and vape pens in low THC strains varying from 12 to 18 percent. “I use different stuff depending on what conditions I am treating. When it gets humid outside, my joints kill me so I use a lot more CBD-based product. If I am having an acute anxiety attack, I prefer something more sativa-based. If I can’t get to sleep, I will medicate with an indica.”</p>
<p>Cutler’s first experience with cannabis was also life changing. “I smoked the weed and I went to sleep. I slept,” he enthused passionately. “That may not be amazing for a lot of people, but if you haven’t slept in five years, it’s amazing. Because what I had to do before that was use all those drugs, plus half a bottle of NyQuil and a good amount of Scotch. That’s the way I lived, that’s the way a lot of us lived. That’s the way a lot of us are living right now who aren’t in this room and they are going to die.” </p>

<h4>THE CONSEQUENCES OF CANNABIS</h4> 
<p>Even though cannabis gives veterans their lives back, there are myriad reasons why they can’t or won’t use it. More often than not it’s concern over losing their VA benefits. Although medical marijuana is legal in 25 states, it’s still federally illegal and so veterans fear becoming part of a state’s medical marijuana registry. </p>
<p>“I think passing Question #2 to get veterans safe access is extremely important because they are going to be able to walk into a dispensary without a medical card and get lab tested medicine. Adult-use would end them having to pay for the fees to keep up with a medical card and it would stop them from buying cannabis on the streets.” Pickering continued, “In some cases they are losing their benefits. They are tied directly to the medications that the VA is prescribing. In order to get their disability pay, they take their medication because their families’ income is reliant on their disability pay.”</p>
<p>Cutler offered another reason why veterans don’t want to register in Nevada’s medical marijuana program. “They are afraid to lose their gun rights because if you have a medical marijuana card they are taking away guys’ CCW permits. War fighters don’t like to lose their guns, it’s not going to happen. But if I am on Ambien, and Seroquel and all this other stuff I can stumble right in and say, ‘give me that AR (assault rifle)’ but if I get high at night to go sleep that’s a problem.”</p>
<h4>MAKING A CASE FOR CANNABIS</h4> 
<p>When it comes to quality of life, the veterans elevate interviewed for this story don’t see a downside to cannabis. </p>
<p>“When you see a vet who is using it and for the first time since he has been at war he or she can sleep through the night without having a panic attack from a nightmare, it’s hard to look past that,” emphasized Lengyel. “I am going to keep driving this point home until someone understands the positive benefits of this far outweigh any negative repercussions. States with medical marijuana in place saw a 20 percent reduction in opiate use within the first year.  </p>
<p>“With the amount of veterans committing suicide or dying from overdoses and the fact that cannabis has the potential to alleviate a lot of those factors, it’s a shame that the government doesn’t do anything. The lack of research or refraining from doing research in any field in the U.S., or the world for that matter, is just a form of complete ignorance and a huge disrespect to the scientific community.”</p>
<p>Cutler disagrees. When he hears people say they can’t vote ‘yes’ on Question 2 “because there’s not enough science. Here’s all the science I need to know: If I say it works, how you can you say it doesn’t? That’s all the science I need.”</p>
<p>But all the veterans included in this story do agree on one thing, cannabis has altered their existence for the better. “It really has changed my life. I don’t think medical marijuana is a miracle cure by any means, but when you stop smoking medical marijuana you aren’t sick for a month-and-a-half straight. If you have to go a day or two without it, it’s not going to kill you like that stuff does,” offered Millken. </p>
<p>“I think cannabis saved my life,” concluded Pickering. “That’s one more that might have gone on the tally.” </p>

<p>Usually, when a veteran fighter sees the battle turning his way, his confidence increases, his spirit lightens. But not Ethan Nadelmann. “My job is to be nervous, in part,” he says, “I think we really need to avoid feeling overconfident now.” Even with a turning tide of marijuana legalization, the founder and executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance knows that there is still a distance to go. “I continue to be invigorated both by the victories that we’re increasingly securing and by the remarkable people that are working to take charge of this movement,” he says, but “I continue to be outraged by the drug war injustices I see all the time.”</p>
<p>Nadelmann has fought for drug policy reform for decades, as an author, teacher and as head of the DPA. While they have led the fight for marijuana reform, it’s only part of the organization’s mission. “Marijuana is only a third of what we do,” he explains. “The second part is ending mass incarceration and the drug war component of that. The last third is about treating drug use and addiction as health issues, not criminal issues.”</p>
<p>The Drug Policy Alliance has always been a global organization—Nadelmann has spoken on issues everywhere from Mexico to the Netherlands. This year, he visited Europe to discuss drug policy and share ideas, but recently there has been something of a change in the tone. “I used to go there to understand how their harm-reduction policies operate. Now they’re inviting me over because they want to understand how could it be that America, the great drug warrior of the world, is leading the world in legalizing cannabis,” he says.</p>
<p>He acknowledges that the reasons for the change are complex—“there’s a whole range of variables in the United States”—but their effects are undeniable. “Take the Gallup polls on marijuana legalization from 2004-2015 and line them up and see a diagonal. It was 34 percent in 2004 and 58 percent last year,” he points out. “I can give kind of an explanation, from generational change to having three presidents in the White House in a row who have used marijuana in one way or another. But the thing that really distinguishes the United States and helps explain the difference is the role of medical marijuana since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>“I think that since the emergence of that issue in the United States, our first policies in California in 1996 and subsequent initiative victories in the western states in ‘98, ‘99 and 2000,” he continues, “that has an impact on the public perception of marijuana, and an impact on who the marijuana consumer was. People saw marijuana being sold above-ground and legally regulated and taxed and they saw that nothing really bad was happening.”</p>
<p>Nadelmann also credits good old American pop culture with contributing to the changing attitude. “What also happened in the late ‘90s, when we first won those medical marijuana initiatives, is the entertainment media started to incorporate medical marijuana. I’d say that from 1997 through 2000, almost every major television entertainment program, both comedies and dramas, rolled in a medical marijuana episode or two,” he says. “In a kind of subtle way, it opened up the door to a conversation about legalization.”</p>
<p>Today, as both medical and recreational marijuana move forward in states across the country, Nadelmann feels that, whether it’s Massachusetts or California, the concerns are the same. “They basically want to know that legalization equals control and regulation and taxation and trying to protect kids. Those are the arguments that persuaded them in four states in 2012 and 2014,” he says, “They want the government to get the tax revenue instead of the gangsters, they want the cops to focus on real crime rather than arresting young people for marijuana. That’s what it boils down to.”</p>
<p>For the states that are moving forward with cannabis, regulations may sometimes be cumbersome, but they offer reassurance to the industry and its customers, as well as the community at large. “It’s about doing it in an intelligent way. Obviously, almost everyone has an interest in consumers being informed and protected,” he says. “If consumers know what they’re getting and there’s some assurances about quality and accountability… there’s reliable packaging, there’s efforts made to protect the users of marijuana products with food processing rules.</p>
<p>“Everybody’s concerned about making sure that those who use marijuana for serious medical purposes have access to higher-grade forms of cannabis that reflect their health needs.” He also notes that those outside of cannabis share some of the some apprehensions as those who are involved in it: “I think there’s a kind of general concern that any type of advertising be limited and done in a respectful way. Everyone’s concerned that this be done in an environmentally beneficial way.”</p>
<p>But, as the guy whose job it is to be nervous, he’s not underestimating the opposition either—he knows that, while every inroad made boosts the legalization side, it also inspires the prohibition crowd. 
“They’ve lost four in a row, right?” he points out. “So I think they’re getting a little more sophisticated and they’re getting more money behind them. In the end, they have to play on emotional, fear-based arguments. That’s their core. And those can be powerful, unfortunately, but the potency of those arguments continues to diminish.”</p>
<p>Nadelmann is also mindful that, in the move forward on marijuana, the mission of reforming drug </p>

<p>laws still needs to remain in focus, with reasonable treatment of those involved in black markets. “The penalties for being involved in illicit marijuana [will] continue to exist,” he explains, “But we should not be punishing people who act outside the system in a way that is disproportionate to any kind of harm it does society. Legalization does equal regulation, and that comes with an expectation that people who want to make money in this market will be fairly regulated and will accept that. But for those who don’t, let’s be reasonable about how harsh those punishments need to be.”</p>
<p>He also is enthused by a new set of allies for the reform movement. “The great thing about Black Lives Matter,” he says, “it’s essentially the emergence of a new, younger Civil Rights movement that is truly embracing the drug policy reform agenda. And that includes ending marijuana prohibition.” He notes that last year’s Drug Policy Alliance Conference in Washington, D.C. included a town hall with BLM members and “it was extremely powerful. I think it’s helping to move public opinion, especially in the African-American community.”</p>
<p>“One thing Black Lives Matter has highlighted,” he continues, “is, for a lot of Americans--especially white Americans but even sometime black or brown Americans--there’s a broad perception that brown people get arrested for drug offenses because they’re more involved in committing those offenses. Even when you show them the statistics that it’s not true, they still find it hard to believe.” While he sees more people becoming aware of the reality, the system is still in dire need of change. “In any town in America, if the police were to randomly stop 100 black men and 100 white men and look in their pockets, the same percentage of black and white men would have a little weed in their pockets. But in every city in America, the black man is two-to-ten times more likely to be arrested, prosecuted and put through the criminal justice system.”</p>
<p>But Nadelmann does take heart at the progress made across a number of fields. “Obviously the victories in marijuana legalization have been the most dramatic; first of all, medical marijuana and now marijuana legalization.” But the other two parts of the Drug Policy Alliance mission have seen movement as well. “Major victories are things like rolling back the Rockefeller drug laws in New York or harsh drug laws in other states or federal mandatory minimums,” he says, “changing 911 laws, laws to reduce overdose fatalities—those things are the kind of victories--big and small--that inspire me to keep going, and the fact that there’s so much more to do.”</p>
<p>“In a way, I’ve always thought of this as a multi-generational struggle. My role is to carry this further, to play a leadership role in this first generation and then kind of hand it off to the second generation. And I think we’re approaching that,” he says. And while Nadelmann will eventually hand the reins to the next generation of activists, he knows the mission will go on: “It’s about freedom and it’s about justice.”</p>

		<title>THE SEARCH FOR CBD-DOMINANT MEDICINE IS OVER</title>
		<link>https://elevatenv.com/the-search-for-cbd-dominant-medicine-is-over/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Justin Alexander</h4>
<p>CBD, or cannabidiol, creams, tinctures, capsules and oils are often preferred by medical marijuana patients for their health benefits without the high that comes from THC-rich products. Working in conjunction with low doses of THC for the highest effectiveness, CBDs have proven to be helpful when it comes to acting as a bronchodilator for asthmatics, reducing the spread of cancer and metastasis, decreasing seizures in childhood epilepsy, and relieving chronic or acute pain. To follow are some CBD and hemp oil based products that are currently being stocked in Nevada dispensaries.</p>

<h3>INFUSED PAIN CREAM</h3>
<p>Developed by Morgan Rebentisch, a licensed aesthetician for more than 10 years, Infused Pain Cream is a labor of love for the skincare devotee. “My family has owned and operated a skin and body care manufacturing facility for over 20 years which [sparked] my passion for the industry,” she says.</p>
<p>Rebentisch decided to infuse the same skin and body care products with cannabis. “I started with the highest quality CBD extract in the world and built our products around it,” she says.</p>
<p>One hundred percent THC-free, Infused Pain Cream’s full spectrum CBD extract at 200 mg contains phytocannabinoids (CBD-A, CBG, CBN and CBC) and terpenes, and it is cultivated and extracted using organic, sustainable farming practices.</p>
<p>Ideally used as an anti-inflammatory for topical discomfort to treat arthritis, backaches, muscle strains, sprains, bruises, cramps, spasms, joint pain, headaches and pre/post workout soreness, it contains capsaicin extract, organic menthol, essential oils, shea butter, organic cocoa butter, and terpenes.</p>
<p>Rebentisch recommends applying a generous amount to the area of discomfort and massaging until completely absorbed.</p>

<h3>KYND TINCTURE</h3>
<p>Kynd’s CBD-dominant tincture at 174 mg works in conjunction with minimally activated THC to create anti-inflammatory pain relief without the feeling of being high. Tinctures hit the bloodstream quick, taken under the tongue, and go directly to the endocannabinoid system. Kynd uses MCT oil and D-Limonene, and CBD-rich strains like Ringo's Gift and AC/DC in its tinctures.</p>
<p>“Our process for infusing the tincture is proprietary, but we work very hard to retain all the most viable compounds available from the cannabis plant,” says Ryan Clendenin, director of production for Kynd Cannabis Company. “Our goal is to be gentle with our extraction and purification processes in order to obtain only the best our flowers have to offer. That's why we extract using supercritical CO2.” </p>
<p>While tinctures work slower than smoking cannabis, they are a great option for those with weakened immune systems or respiratory issues and patients can use the MCT oil-based product to blend into fats/oils in recipes.</p>
<p>Best for anti-inflammatory, anti-pain, and mood stabilization, many patients say that tinctures can help control jitters and sleepless nights. When in doubt on dosage, go with how you feel, starting with a few drops for minor anxiety.</p>
<p>Administer by holding 1/2 ml of Kynd Tincture under the tongue for about 20 seconds. Add Kynd Tincture to smoothies, coffee or tea. Infuse homemade edibles with the tincture, which is not alcohol-based and safe to use in larger doses.</p>
<p>“Most of the first cannabis indica medicines in the U.S. market were tinctures or syrups,” Clendenin says. “This dates back to the 1850s, of course, but nonetheless the non-smoking forms of cannabis use have been popular all along this great experiment of medicine making, with prohibition being the greatest hurdle to real progress on human healthcare from chronic pain management to cancer treatment.”</p>

<h3>SILVER SAGE WELLNESS’S JIMMY B. OIL CAPS</h3>
<p>Silver Sage Wellness makes products with a purpose. In this case, it’s JBO capsules, which come in different strengths and are named after the founder’s son Jimmy Blasco who is autistic.</p>
<p>“JBO capsules are created using a two-part extraction process with a high CBD-to-THC ratio for patients looking to tackle the biggest diseases and conditions that can be difficult, if not impossible, to treat with standard medicine,” says Joseph Cavi of Silver Sage Wellness. “In making JBO, the standard extraction process using isopropyl alcohol has been modified so that patients can consume by oral syringe or by capsule.”</p>
<p>Extracted from vegetable oil, tinctures provide rapid relief from pain and inflammation and contain all natural cannabinoids, organic coconut oil, kosher-certified soy lecithin powder, and gelatin.</p>
<p>Use as a daily supplement morning and evening by dropping under the tongue and letting it dissolve to assist with eating and sleeping. Tinctures can be added directly to any recipe.</p>
<p>Perfect for travel, capsules are for those looking to medicate discreetly and good for diabetics interested in avoiding sugars and other ingredients found in edible medications. Take one capsule and wait 40 to 60 minutes to judge effectiveness before increasing dosage. Always stay hydrated and have food in your system when consuming cannabis oil.</p>
<p>“Capsules are recommended for all patients looking for relief, especially those patients suffering from cancer, epilepsy, fibromyalgia, IBS, diabetes, and PTSD,” says Cavi. “Tinctures are preferred by patients who have a hard time swallowing large capsules and who suffer from migraines, nausea and have trouble sleeping.”</p>

<h3>O.PENVAPE CRAFT RESERVE: CBD RESERVE-ACAPULCO GOLD</h3>
<p>Made from a strain that comes from areas around Acapulco, Mexico, the orange hairs of the Acapulco Gold flower resemble a golden nugget with gold, green, and brown colors of resin collecting on the buds. Smoking Acapulco Gold has been described as having dinner at a five-star restaurant says Robbie Wright, head of production for The Grove.</p>
<p>“Aromas of burnt toffee linger when the bud is broken up and has a reputation for being one of the best cannabis strains ever created with the effects it achieves for the patient,” he says.</p>
<p>While dosage is dependent on symptoms and medical condition, since this is a high-CBD strain, Wright says that users often find they need more—Acapulco Gold plants can have as much as 23 percent THC potency, and the CBD content ranges from four to 12 percent. Wright notes that a strain with a four percent CBD potential is considered high.</p>
<p>Made using a CO2 extraction process, followed by many refining steps, patients receive the cleanest and most cannabinoid-infused oil possible.</p>
<p>Acapulco Gold CBD is for sufferers of general anxiety disorder or PTSD. It also works to lift spirits and decrease stress. The body high can also relieve chronic aches and pains.</p>
<p>Wright is quick to point out the differences between hemp oil products and CBDs, the former he says are not as powerful. “THC needs to be present in small amounts in order to synergistically work with the CBDs in transportation to the receptor sites in our body's endocannabinoid system,” Wright says. </p>
<p>“The sooner more studies are conducted, the more we will learn, but that takes the government to take a stronger stance on the classification cannabis is currently in. Without change, the best medical studies that could be conducted will never see the light of day due to the federal restrictions in place. We only know a small amount of the potential this plant can provide. The sooner restrictions are lifted, the quicker we can inform the public.”</p>

<h3>CHARLOTTE’S WEB INFUSED MINT CHOCOLATE OR OLIVE OIL </h3>
<p>Charlotte’s Web hemp extract oil is often confused as being a CBD but, in fact, that has never been an accurate description given that it has always been a whole plant hemp oil extract that contains all beneficial cannabinoids, according to Amanda Reilly of CWNevada, LLC.</p>
<p>Charlotte’s Web is named for Charlotte Figi who suffered more than 300 seizures per week before being given low-THC, cannabinoid-rich hemp extract oil by her parents. Figi is now 99.7 percent seizure-free.</p>
<p>Developed from the world-class hemp genetics of the Stanley Brothers, Charlotte’s Web is cloned, hand planted and organically farmed in Colorado. “Hemp has been used for thousands of years for a variety of wellness needs and the U.S. government patented the cannabinoids in hemp as antioxidants and neuroprotectants in 2003,” says Reilly. “Charlotte's Web hemp extract oils can be used without side effects to address a variety of wellness issues.”</p>
<p>From kids with seizures to the aging population's muscle aches and pains to stressed executives with high anxiety, the main goal of Charlotte’s Web is to improve quality of life. Moreover, cannabinoids are a great alternative to opioids.</p>
<p>Recommended use is to take orally. Those with minor bodily stresses should try 1 to 2 ml per day of Charlotte's Web Everyday which contains 7mg/ml of Charlotte's Web hemp extract. Use as you would fish oil. Patients with more severe bodily stresses should try 1 to 2 ml per day of Charlotte's Web Everyday Plus product (18mg/ml) and those with severe stresses should try 1 to 2 ml per day of Charlotte's Web Everyday Advanced product (50mg/ml).</p>
<p>“It's exciting to be on the forefront of finally gaining the proper research on how beneficial cannabinoids can be,” says Reilly. “Since 1937, society was taught that this plant killed brain cells and was of the devil. Now we are learning the exact opposite might be true.”</p>

<h3>EVERGREEN ORGANIX’S PHOENIX TEARS SYRINGE OIL</h3>
<p>A review of Greek mythology reminds us the Phoenix was a mythical bird whose tears could heal wounds. Appropriately named, Evergreen’s Phoenix Tears Syringe Oil gets its healing power from RSO, which, in this case, provides relief from chronic panic and injuries.</p>
<p>A solvent-based process of extracting cannabis oil using the RSO method, developed by Rick Simpson as reflected in the name, the cannabis flower is soaked in a laboratory-grade ethyl-alcohol for 48 hours or more, strained, and then the solvent is evaporated over heat. The reduction process yields the concentrated oil. Cannabis soaks for a long period of time to maximize extraction to include cannabinoids and terpenes, but also phytochemicals, plant sterols, chlorophyll, and other medicinal components of the plant.</p>
<p>To use, apply Phoenix Tears directly to the skin, mix with lotions, swallow in capsules, take sublingually or dilute into various types of oils for cooking or topical applications. With a ratio of 499.6 mg THC to 2.67 mg CBD, it is recommended that new users consume less than one drop of Phoenix Tears in one sitting.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>OREGON</h2>
On October 1, Oregonians could legally buy marijuana for recreational use at shops intended for that purpose. The Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) approved licenses for 26 retailers around the state, meeting a key deadline almost two years after voters passed a ballot measure legalizing pot. October had been set as the month in which retail store licensing would start under an OLCC timeline. Medical marijuana stores have been permitted to sell recreational marijuana since last October. Such dispensaries won't be allowed to sell to recreational users after Dec. 31. The approved retail shops are located in the Portland area, and in southern, central and western Oregon. Ten testing laboratories have also been licensed.

<h2>ALASKA</h2>
The Alaska 
Marijuana Control Board issued the state’s first retail business license in September. Frozen Budz, which plans to make cannabis-infused products, received Alaska’s first retail license. Many other applications remain under consideration, and the review process for other retail businesses continues. In addition, it has not adopted rules or considered applications for cannabis cafés, which are establishments that allow on-site consumption of alcohol commonly available for adults 21 and over who choose to consume a safer product should be able to partake at a regulated establishment, whether a resident or not.

A Saint Leo University poll released in late September indicated public support for an amendment that would legalize the use of medical cannabis in Florida. Amendment 2 will allow Florida doctors to legally recommend medical marijuana to their patients with debilitating illnesses. Passage of Amendment 2 also authorizes the Department of Health to issue identification cards to patients and caregivers who qualify, as well as register and regulate facilities to produce and distribute cannabis for medical purposes. Although a Florida amendment to legalize the use of medical marijuana in 2014 was unsuccessful, favorability toward 
the amendment sits at 68 percent as of September. The amendment is required to get 60 percent of the vote for it to pass into law. In 2014, it received 58 percent.

<h2>NEW HAMPSHIRE</h2>
Both major parties’ nominees for New Hampshire governor, Colin Van Ostern (D) and Chris Sununu (R), are on record in favor of decriminalizing marijuana possession. It now appears very likely that New Hampshire will be able to pass a marijuana decriminalization bill in 2017. Pro-decriminalization Republicans, Frank Edeblut and Sununu, finished in a near-tie for first with a combined more than 60 percent of the vote, laying to rest any lingering belief that Republican voters might support continuing the state’s war on marijuana users.

<h2>NEW JERSEY</h2>
In September, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie signed Assembly Bill 457, which adds post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to the list of qualifying conditions for the state’s medical marijuana program, making it legal for veterans and other people suffering from PTSD to participate in the program. There is no waiting period for the law to take effect. A statement issued by Governor Christie, who has frequently said he opposes medical marijuana, says the measure was put into action to help soldiers who emerged with this disorder following the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Christie said the new law is intended to “provide struggling veterans and others with the ability to use medical marijuana to treat PTSD, but only after it has been determined by a physician or psychiatrist that conventional medical therapy is ineffective.”

By exhibiting at community events and festivals such as Bite of Las Vegas, ShowGrow has been able to bring medical cannabis into the light and reach an audience that may otherwise feel uneasy about the emergence of dispensaries in their community.

		<title>DEPT. OF VETERANS AFFAIRS MUST MODERNIZE POLICIES RELATED TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By U.S. Congresswoman Dina Titus</p>

<p>On Veterans Day, we must recommit our efforts to bring federal policy in line with state laws and support scientists who recognize the value of treating PTSD, epilepsy, nausea, and severe pain with medical marijuana. </p>
<p>As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, my prerogative is to ensure that we provide the safest, most innovative, and most humane health care options to those who wore the uniform and now suffer from service-related mental or physical ailments. </p>
<p>That’s why I believe the Department of Veterans Affairs must modernize its policies related to medical marijuana. The VA’s current protocol forces veterans, in states where it is legal, to seek medicinal cannabis on their own rather than with a VA doctor’s advice and supervision. That makes no sense.</p>
<p>In our effort to provide veterans a fulfilling, pain-free life, we cannot ignore the fact that too many of our heroes have developed an overreliance on prescription opioids, which, in turn, has often led to increased addiction, homelessness, and suicide.</p>
<p>Nearly 60 percent of our veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan suffer from chronic pain which resulted in a major spike in opioid prescriptions. In fact, from 2001 to 2013 there was a 270 percent increase in opioid prescriptions in the VA. The Department’s latest data show that 13 percent of veterans who take opioids— around 68,000—are addicted. </p>
<p>After recognizing the problem, the VA took action: prescriptions have been reduced by 20 percent; there is a push for alternative therapy options like yoga and service animals; and more attention is being paid to screening for depression and substance abuse. But we have more work to do. VA directives continue to prohibit VA doctors from prescribing or even speaking with veterans about medical marijuana as a potential treatment, even in states where it is legal.</p>
<p>I am working to change that by asking my colleagues in Congress to remove the current barriers preventing veterans from having conversations with their doctors about accessing medical marijuana. We must pass the Veterans Equal Access Act, H.R. 667, legislation that would eliminate the current VA policy.</p>
<p>Republican opposition has kept the measure from becoming law, but each time Congress has voted on it, we have seen more and more lawmakers recognize the need for a change. </p>
<p>As we work to expand access, we must also strive to learn more about the effects of medical marijuana. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency recently approved the first federal study to assess the therapeutic benefits of medical marijuana to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among veterans. My hope is that this research will encourage the VA to undertake additional studies in this field.</p>
<p>I recently hosted a roundtable with student veterans from UNLV who told me stories about how they have coped after returning home from Iraq and Afghanistan with injured minds and bodies. </p>
<p>One student described how he lost his sense of self after a VA doctor prescribed a 450-milligram daily dose of opioids to fight his service-related injuries. Others echoed similar stories about how powerful prescription drugs led to intense bouts of loneliness and depression.</p>
<p>Many of them have gone to local medical marijuana dispensaries in Las Vegas to treat their pain. They strongly believe trading opioids for medical marijuana has brought about positive changes in their lives. </p>
<p>Veterans should not have to seek treatment alone, nor should doctors rely solely on powerful painkillers to treat the varied ailments our service members face. We must be creative and innovative and think outside the box about potential treatments.</p>
<p>Our service members make significant sacrifices while in uniform. We owe it to them to continue promoting the safest and most effective care when they come home, whatever form that may be, including medical marijuana. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The marijuana industry is going legit and right along with it is Tommy Chong. </p>
<p>Chong, who became an iconic figure in the marijuana movement as a result of starring in the Cheech & Chong movie franchise made popular in the late ‘70s and early ‘80s, has used his movie fame to go straight just as the entire cannabis industry is also becoming legal.</p>
<p>Known best for embodying the antics of one of two potheads who became the poster boys for stoner culture, Chong is now enjoying a new adventure in the cannabis industry. It’s a journey that has resulted from an experience with illness that is no laughing matter. Ironically, what was once fodder for both a comedy routine and the premise of an entire catalog of movies has aided Chong in both overcoming the challenges of cancer and starting a career as a cannabis entrepreneur. </p>

<h3>THINGS ARE TOUGH ALL OVER</h3>
<p>Diagnosed with prostate and rectal cancer, Chong began medical treatment for both in 2014. Chong had been diagnosed with prostate cancer a few years earlier but was told it was very slow growing and wouldn’t require aggressive treatment. “Unfortunately I ended up contracting rectal cancer, too, and that’s when I got real serious. </p>
<p>“I did radiation and chemo and had the operation, and that took about a couple of months. I got the operations, they closed off the rectal on me and they equipped me with a colostomy bag, which I named Donald Trump, by the way, so it’s apropos because it’s always full of hot air and shit,” quipped Chong, who clearly has not lost his sense of humor. </p>
<p>In addition to traditional cancer treatments, Chong also used cannabis. “I will tell you where the pot really came into play,” explained Chong. “After the operation I lost about 30 lbs. and I was down to under 140 lbs. and at my age that’s not healthy. I got out of the hospital and I got home. My gorgeous wife told me to go smoke some weed. I smoked some bud, some really nice medical sativa and that night I remember it so clear because I woke up and I was hungry and I hadn’t had an appetite because the oxycontin and other drugs take away your appetite. If you don’t have an appetite and you are older, that’s the first sign of death.</p>
<p>“I hobbled to the refrigerator, opened the frig door and I was hungry. I had some roast chicken and I just ate. The high got me thinking comedic thoughts again. Like, for instance, going to the refrigerator in the middle of the night like stoners do and from that moment on, every time I would get miserable, I would go smoke a little bit. Then I started rehabbing myself by smoking because when you get high, you start having all of these creative thoughts.”</p>
<p>Not only did Chong use cannabis to find his creativity again, but he also found it aided in his cancer recovery. “My span of cancer treatment was about a year. I did the operation, chemo pills and radiation, they radiated the prostate area, they didn’t have to remove it. With me, I still got the equipment. It’s coming back a little bit at a time. After the operation I started injecting cannabis oil into the muscle. I did the injections for about two weeks, it made me feel much better.</p>
<p>“I went to the oncologist about two weeks ago for an MRI as a follow-up because I got off the chemo and other treatments and I am totally clean. I beat it in a year,” reported Chong of his newly diagnosed cancer-free status. </p>
<p>Chong attributes being cancer-free to a combination of both the traditional medical treatments he received and cannabis. “It’s the way the pot affects the brain; that is the most important thing because it calms the brain and puts you to sleep. It gets you really stoned and being really stoned is slowing brain activity down to a crawl so that you are almost a vegetable. But that’s what they do for people who are really sick, they put them in medically induced comas to help them recover.”</p>
<p>Prior to his use of cannabis for cancer, Chong was unaware of the medicinal properties of the plant. “Unfortunately I didn’t know. Had I known that, I would have been, when I went to prison, I would have been smoking it,” explained Chong, who spent nine months in prison in 2003 for selling glass pipes and bongs across state lines. “I got offered a lot of pot and then I would get drug tested so I actually quit smoking for almost three years while I was in the court system. Then a couple of years after I got out of prison, I got diagnosed with prostate cancer so I think that my not smoking it had a lot to do with me getting cancer. That’s just my theory.”</p>


<h3>STILL SMOKIN’</h3>
<p>With this theory in mind, Chong decided to create Chong’s Choice, a line of cannabis products that the actor-turned-businessman says is innately medical. “We look at our product like it is all medical. They talk about recreational, but to me all pot use is medical. If it comes from Chong’s Choice, it’s medical.” </p>
<p>The Chong’s Choice line of products includes oil cartridges, THC strips (infused breath strip), flower, and pre-rolls that are currently sold in Arizona, California, Colorado, Montana, Oregon and Washington. Chong’s Choice will be launched in the Nevada market on November 8 at Shango Las Vegas where Chong will introduce hybrid, indica and sativa flower and shatter product lines.</p>
<p>“We contact growers that grow the best,” explained Chong of how he determines the flower used in Chong’s Choice. “We find out who the best growers are in different areas and we form a partnership and as long as they are providing us with a topnotch product, they are part of the Chong’s Choice family. We guarantee the product, the high quality.” </p>
<p>Chong and the team at Chong’s Choice concern themselves with the methods that the growers use when deciding who they will work with. “We want to make sure there’s no poison on the plant and no poison in the fertilizer. The truth is if you use the right techniques, you will have superior bud but you have to make sure the water is clean, the environment is clean, and that the workers know what they are doing.</p>
<p>AWe are dealing with a medical substance and so it has to be topnotch in order to be effective.”</p>

<h3>NICE DREAMS</h3>
<p>“If you look at the Cheech and Chong history, the message was always there. It’s subliminal but it’s there. It was a conscious decision on my part. If I was going to represent a stoner, I wanted people to see a guy who worked out with weights, and ate healthy,” Chong continued, “my message has always been either blatant or subliminal humor, I always promoted humor with marijuana, no one ever got hurt in our movies, there was no greed factor involved, if anything it was what pot does to you. It makes you forget certain things like your name. That’s why it worked hand in hand it wasn’t...I wasn’t really surprised, we weren’t rebels in a sense, we were missionaries.”</p>
<p>And a missionary he remains – continuing to spread the word. “Everybody has to do their homework, I don’t care who it is. They come to me with all sorts of ailments and fears. I tell them you have to know everything you can about what you are putting in your body and you have to be comfortable with it but read everything you can. Do what I did, study it and study the plant itself. Study the whole thing and put your mind at ease. The last thing I want anybody to do is take my word for it because what works for me might not work for you.”</p>
<p>Chong enthusiastically continued, “That’s the kind of knowledge and encouragement people need because the healing process is about knowing that what you are doing is going to heal you. If you have faith in it, then you will be healed. I don’t care what disease you have, do your homework, make sure you know what you are putting in your body. You should know that with all the drugs they give you. Just read the label before you put it your body.”</p>
<p>Chong is not surprised that marijuana has and continues to have a positive impact on his life. “What pot really did for me was put an intelligent and positive spin on my life and it’s been doing that all my life. The other great thing is the spiritual aspect because, once, after I did my first toke of cannabis I went on a God search. </p>
<p>“I have always leaned in that direction. When I was kid I went to Sunday school and I ended up teaching it and I went to a bible camp when I was eight years old, and it changed my life. I learned how to pray and I learned the basic Christian teachings, the parables, and it stayed with me all my life, but when I got into cannabis I went more into the Eastern spiritual area. Cannabis is really responsible for me going on a God search. If you want to be happy for the rest of your life, look for God. That’s all it takes.”</p>
<p>That and making people laugh, Chong concluded.  “I think when you make people laugh, you are healing a lot of ailments that they don’t even know they have. I think that’s the greatest thing about cannabis is that it makes you laugh and the reason it makes you laugh is because you start focusing in on silly little things you didn’t notice before.</p>
<p>“And so I have come to the conclusion, I have always been right. Back in the ‘70s we did an interview and I asked what if we are right? What if Cheech and Chong are right and everybody else is wrong? And it’s proven to be.” </p>

		<title>BLÜM’S THE WORD</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With eight MME licenses in Nevada, it’s safe to say Terra Tech Corporation, the first U.S.-based, publicly-traded company to touch every aspect of the cannabis lifecycle from cultivation and extraction to retail sales, has made the Silver State a major part of its plan to continue legitimizing the cannabis industry.</p>
<p>Leading the charge for Terra Tech is former banker Derek Peterson, who says of the strategy he has methodically developed, “We didn’t want to spread everywhere in the country because we are still a small company in bandwidth. For us to put energy in Oregon and Washington, it would come at an opportunity cost so we made a decision to put one of our two primary focuses on California, obviously because it has the fifth or sixth largest economy on the planet and the largest medical marijuana economy in the union so that was a no-brainer,” continues the Terra Tech CEO, and co-owner of Blüm dispensaries, which has licenses for four dispensaries, two cultivation centers, and two production and extraction facilities in Nevada</p>
<p>“Nevada is very smart when it comes to regulation as we can see in how they handled the oversight of gaming regulations. We knew they would regulate well but that they would leave it very open to being friendly to entrepreneurs, and that is the most important piece when we look at legislation across the United States -- is it entrepreneurial friendly? Do we have a decent probability of getting a return on that investment? In New York, for example, the answer to that question is ‘no’ because they have a very limited program and the existence of the black market, and any overt operator will tell you we just can't compete against the black market. With Nevada we knew they would do a great job of regulating, but the state would also leave it open enough so entrepreneurs could have a lot of flexibility and navigate the industry very well.”</p>
<p>In addition to including Nevada in its overall growth strategy, another part of Terra Tech’s end goal is to be on a national exchange at some point. “Our objective is to build the company into a $75-million-dollar company with a significant balance sheet. We went from a few million in shareholder equity to over $40 million in shareholder equity in the last year so our fundamentals are intact. But we going to get a little bit bigger before we knock on their door and we have already taken a lot of measures that would be required by the Nasdaq,” explains Peterson of future plans, even though he acknowledges that until banking regulations are sorted out he won’t be ringing the Nasdaq bell anytime soon. </p>
<p>In 2015, Terra Tech’s revenue was close to $10 million. Because Peterson forecasts that the company will do between $20 and $22 million this year and is on a run rate to have similar expansion in the coming years, it appears Peterson will soon have his house in order even if the Nasdaq doesn’t. </p>
<p>To continue fostering Terra Tech’s exponential expansion, Peterson cites a plan that combines acquisition and organic growth. “California is a primary focus for acquisition right now because it’s very fragmented, it is very mom and pop. People who have been in the industry for close to 20 years are ready to cash out so we want to acquire other retail dispensaries and brand them under our Blüm banner so they have the same look and feel, and a measure of consistency as any franchise model would. We want to increase cultivation to have the backbone to distribute additional products through that retail footprint.”</p>
<p>As for organic growth such as Peterson pursued in the Nevada marketplace, he says, “We will want to go after permits ourselves in different municipalities, but that's a little bit of a longer game. For us, it's a long game-short game. When you go after a permit you have to spend a year on the legislative cycle, months and months and months on the permitting process and they take their time scoring, and once you find out you have won you have to build out the facilities so you are two or three years down the line before you are doing anything that even comes close to getting a return on your investment. Whereas acquiring an existing facility that is up and operating with cash flow and generating revenue is extremely short-term.</p>
<p>“So we try to balance the long-term activities with the short-term in order to build a massive retail footprint and a massive kind of calculated cultivation, extraction, and production footprint as well. That’s our goal over the next couple of years and that’s how we think we break $100 million -- through acquisitions in the short run and, fortunately, we have the tools, the shelf registration, and the financing to be able to execute on that.”</p>
<p>Not only will Peterson grow Terra Tech into a national cannabis powerhouse, but the 42-year-old believes his strategy will bring a good measure of legitimacy to the cannabis space. “When there is a fully transparent company that is operating -- not on the fringe and not on the software side, not on the technical side, but actually growing seed-to-sale, processing extracts and retailing the cannabis out to consumers -- the optics of that will bring a tremendous amount of legitimacy to the space.</p>
<p>“We have created a roadmap because we were the first and we went through the headache, expense, and risk of doing it -- just like the original growers paved the way for the new people who came into the marketplace and took the most risk -- on the corporate side. So for us, that's our biggest contribution -- that the other companies now have a roadmap, they know how to go from point A to point B, to get capitalized and to execute on their business model. I think that's provided a huge benefit and a huge resource to the cannabis industry at large.”</p>
<p>While Peterson’s aggressive strategy in crossing the green line has been arduous, he believes it’s an industry that is worth the struggle. “A lot of startups fail so it creates a nice litmus test where people are able say, ‘These guys went from $500,000 in sales to $25 million plus, plus, plus in sales and a huge amount of shareholder equity in a very short period of time’,” says Peterson. “It brings people a measure of confidence that they can come into an industry as challenging and competitive as ours and execute and do well.” </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MedMen broke ground on a new $15 million, 45,000-square-foot cannabis production and cultivation facility, located off Interstate 80 in Washoe County, in early October. The facility, expected to be fully operational in 2017, will serve as a model for the industry with a 26,000-square-foot, state-of-art Dutch-style greenhouse employing the latest in agro-technology, a cutting-edge extraction and production facility that measures 19,000 square feet, and high-tech testing lab for quality control. This will be MedMen’s first project in Nevada and is expected to produce 10,000 pounds of cannabis annually, and will employ nearly 200 people during the construction phase, and 50 people when fully operational.</p>
<p>“Cannabis is the fastest growing industry in the country, expected to reach more than $20 billion dollars in sales by 2020,” said Adam Bierman, MedMen’s CEO and co-founder. “This facility is a shining example of what is possible when smart capital and industry expertise come together. We selected Nevada for a number of reasons, in no small part its business-friendly environment, but above all because this state is on the leading edge of the cannabis evolution. We are at an inflection point in our industry. We have passed the tipping point, and cannabis will become mainstream. Nevada just happens to be more progressive than most other states. We look forward to making this a showpiece for Nevada, the cannabis industry and our company and we look forward to working closely with the local community.”</p>
<p>“Our philosophy is that cannabis is like any other industry, and we operate it like any other industry with institutional best practices and subject matter expertise,” added MedMen co-founder and COO Andrew Modlin. “What we do differently is that we bring a high level of innovation and performance.” </p>

<h3>THE+SOURCE CULTIVATES NEW LOCATION IN HENDERSON </h3>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Inyo Fine Cannabis doesn’t waste time. The local dispensary and delivery service offered assistance to Veterans Village on the spot after being introduced to the program last year by one of their budtenders, Sheldon Gates, who is an Army veteran having served in Iraq.</p>
<p>“He liked what he saw and said, ‘What can we do?’” Veterans Village founder Arnold Stalk relays of his introduction to Inyo co-owner David Goldwater. “Inyo has been an absolute blessing. Without the private sector, we would not be open. They help us help people who are hurting and suffering.”</p>
<p>Veterans Village’s two facilities make it so that no homeless veteran in Las Vegas needs to be on the streets. The converted motels now house about 375 veterans a night, and its crisis intervention center helps about 5,000 people a month. </p>
<p>IThe program has been such a success that this year it caught the eye of the White House. Cynthia Dias, a former homeless woman who served in Vietnam and is now self-sufficient after staying at Veterans Village, sat with First Lady Michelle Obama during the President’s last State of the Union address.</p>
<p> “We’ve become the gold standard of how to treat vets in the U.S.,” says Stalk, who traveled to the White House with Dias. He founded Veterans Village as a promise to his father, a Navy veteran from World War II who passed away six years ago, the year before Stalk opened the Village. </p>
<p>Success stories like Dias’s are what brought national attention to this inspiring program, although Stalk also has a soft spot for elderly veterans who are welcome to stay permanently. “We have a lot of seniors,” Stalk says. “They often have nothing. They put themselves in harm’s way so we can continue to have our freedom, so here they are treated as they should be treated.”</p>
<p>Veterans Village offers both transitional and permanent housing to veterans – but don’t think they stop at providing just a warm bed to sleep in. Food comes from hot spots such as Whole Foods and Starbucks, and Veterans Village also provides healthcare, transportation, and job counseling. Inyo’s monthly donation covers all of this for one veteran every month.</p>
<p>Inyo will be increasing its support of Veterans Village this month by donating 20 percent of its Veterans Day sales to the charity. </p>

		<title>UNDERSTANDING CHANGES TO NAC 453A STATE ADOPTS REVISED REGULATIONS TO MEDICAL USE OF MARIJUANA LAW</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Riana Durrett & Amanda Connor</p>
<p>This past January, the Division of Public and Behavioral Health began gathering input on the regulations under Nevada Administrative Code (“NAC”) 453A which regulates the use of medical marijuana in the state. Throughout the year, the Division accepted comments from representatives of the medical marijuana industry, patients and other members of the public discussing the most needed changes to the program. As a result of these many months of discussions and multiple versions of proposed regulations, the Division ultimately adopted revised regulations on September 9, 2016.  The final version can be found on the Division’s website at <a href="http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Register/2015Register/R148-15A.pdf">www.leg.state.nv.us/Register/2015Register/R148-15A.pdf</a></p>
<style="margin-left:10px" ul>
	<li>With regard to measuring products, the new regulations define those that are processed as an edible or concentrated product as a “production run”rather than a batch. </li>
	<li>The new regulations provide guidelines on research and development. They allow product cultivated forresearch and development to be sold once it passesquality assurance tests. </li>
	<li>A medical marijuana establishment (“MME”) is nowallowed to submit a compiled financial statement,rather than a CPA-certified audit.</li>
	<li>Wood surfaces are allowed under certain conditions. </li>
	<li>Testing of up to 125 pounds of “wet” marijuana that is destined for extraction is permissible. </li>
	<li>Foreign matter is defined. </li>
	<li>The new regulations set forth an independentcontractor category for agent cards and set forth rulesrelating to independent contractors. </li>
	<li>Annual due date for fees on registration certificate renewals. </li>
	<li>Requirements relating to inventory control andtracking have changed.</li>
	<li>Labeling requirements have changed.  </li>
	<li>Requests for retesting have changed. </li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to making the changes, various representatives of the medical marijuana industry testified before the Nevada State Legislative Commission.  The representatives and the Division agreed that they would continue to work to make improvements to various areas. Possible areas for improvement could include the following: </p>
<ul style="margin-left:10px">
	<li>Addressing microbial limits, such as treating harmfulbacteria differently than beneficial bacteria. </li>
	<li>Addressing testing issues, such as treating edibleproducts and concentrated products differently. </li>
	<li>Improving consistency in testing results. </li>
	<li>Streamlining the agent card system.  </li>

</ul>
<p>While the regulations are not perfect, with the help of medical marijuana industry representatives, patients, advocates and other public figures, Nevada is well on its way to improving regulations for marijuana in Nevada. </p>

		<title>Moxie brings signature live resin and commitment to be a community partner to Nevada market</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The team at Moxie Extracts feels just as strongly about being a world renowned cannabis concentrate maker as they do about educating patients on its benefits. “Our goal is to help more patients, period,” explains the company’s founder and President Jordan Lams. “We start by educating patients on how to safely use cannabis concentrates and then introduce them to a quality product they can use to find relief.”</p>
<p>Employing a philosophy described by Lams as a safe and reliable means of providing patients cannabinoid medicine, Moxie currently works exclusively with medicinal dispensaries. That focus is a result of Lams' younger sister’s terminal diagnosis and ensuing illness from leukemia. </p>
<p>“It’s rough, I have had family members go through it and it’s one of the most brutal things you can watch someone you love go through,” he notes of cancer. “To have anything that helps that -- I wanted to scream it from the mountaintops and tell anyone who would listen and this just seemed like the best outlet for that.” </p>
<p>Moxie’s signature product is its live resin. “It was our first product and it is our primary product. It makes up most of our business, and it’s the one we have won the most awards for,” says Lams. </p>
<p>Moxie has other products in development but wants to ensure that “when we implement something on a national scale, we want to make sure that it is holds up to our standards. We have to make sure the quality is consistent in all markets before we release it, and that it’s a product people are actually going to want,” offers Lams. Moxie is currently operating in California, Nevada, and Michigan. They are about to open a facility in Colorado, and eventually will have a presence in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts in early 2017.</p>
<p>That steadfast approach has worked very well for the concentrate company as they have been awarded over 50 different awards and accolades, namely for non-psychoactive cannabidiol products.</p>
<p>Not only has their dedication and measured pace won Moxie a significant number of accolades, it has also allowed them to pursue their vision of being a good corporate citizen as they grow. “We are not a Wall Street fund trying to make $100 million dollars. We are a small family business that’s trying to join a community and become partners in areas that understand and appreciate what it is that this business can do. We can lend a huge hand,” Lams passionately enthuses. “Whether it’s the school system in Nevada or helping hurting former manufacturing towns in Pennsylvania, we are here to provide jobs and outreach to the community as well as alternative therapies to patients.”</p>
<p>Lams is sanguine about his commitment to the cannabis industry. “There was a major need for good people with proper intentions, who have experience and can relate to the situation, to provide a level of compassion to people who are otherwise in a really horrible situation with regard to the way healthcare is run in this country. I felt, and continue to feel, a fiduciary responsibility to the patients to do this right, and it has turned about to be a great decision.” </p>

HOW DID YOU START IN THE INDUSTRY? WHY?  
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">

My foray into cannabis began in 2011 when I was invited to Colorado to visit a commercial cultivation facility. At the time, I was serving as COO of an alternative asset private equity firm focused on the luxury hotel and resort asset class in South Florida, the Caribbean, and South America. I co-founded that company in 2008 after serving as General Counsel to a resort development company. Having completed my undergraduate and legal studies at the University of Colorado, which in hindsight proved to be fortuitous, I was quite familiar with the landscape of Colorado but completely unfamiliar with the legal cannabis industry. The moment I set foot in that grow, I knew that my professional life was going to take an unexpected turn.

WHAT WAS SO ATTRACTIVE ABOUT CANNABIS TO WOO YOU AWAY FROM THE INVESTMENT SECTOR/PRIVATE EQUITY?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

After a year of intensive research, I recognized what is clear to most today -- a “generational macro trend” in the emerging legal cannabis industry. Being deeply rooted in the private equity world, I was struck by the dearth of traditional investment capital in what was quickly becoming a multi-billion dollar industry. I observed that institutional investors in particular were sidelined and the growth of the industry and the quality of its participants were suppressed due to outmoded federal prohibition and the resulting conflict between federal and state laws. Yet, the industry was quickly gaining legal standing across the U.S. along with unprecedented public support and was poised for explosive growth. I was, and remain, convinced that eventually the legal barriers, in the form of federal prohibition, would fall.

WHAT WAS THE IDEA BEHIND MJARDÍN? HOW DID IT EMERGE?  
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

During my private equity days, I participated in the development and operation of a hotel management company that was formed to manage one of our luxury hotel assets. I saw how a third-party operating company could deliver much needed service to its clients and scale in a really significant way. I recognized that there would be an emerging need for the services of professional management companies in the cannabis space, of which there were few to none at the time. I also understood that as the industry expanded across the United States, more sophisticated capital would enter into the space to invest in existing companies and to pursue licenses, oftentimes under a limited license framework. With the expansion of the industry, facilities would become larger, more expensive, and more complex. Investors in those companies would be looking for the support of a proven operator. MJardín could be ideally suited to fit such needs. Today, we describe ourselves as a turnkey cultivation services company that provides day-to-day facility management to select cannabis businesses across the United States. We have become an industry leader with clients in 10 states producing over 130,000 lbs. to date.

IS JARDÍN YOUR FIRST CANNABIS DISPENSARY? WHAT MAKES JARDÍN DIFFERENT?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I am a co-owner of a medical dispensary in Colorado and have been peripherally involved with others, but this is the first time I have taken the lead as an operator. While the names are similar, this is a completely separate company from MJardín. I enjoy the cultivation side of the business, but it is, of course, primarily business-to-business. The development of the dispensary and the Jardín brand, on the other hand, has allowed me to tap into my passion and creativity and the dispensary will afford a greater opportunity to interact with clients and the community. A great deal of thought and attention to detail has gone into the construction of the dispensary and development of the brand. Jardín (“garden” in Spanish) is intended to elevate the dispensary experience for our guests. We are striving to create a “luxury” experience in terms of the physical dispensary, the products we carry, our staff and culture, and our overall guest experience, yet we want to ensure that we are perfectly accessible to all. We have set a high bar for ourselves and are very excited to introduce Jardín to Las Vegas.

<h2>NORTH DAKOTA</h2>
On November 8th, 64 percent of North Dakota voters approved Measure 5, a medical marijuana initiative called the North Dakota Compassionate Care Act. Measure 5 will allow patients with a qualifying condition and a doctor’s recommendation to receive medical marijuana through a state-licensed dispensary. Patients will be able to possess up to 3 ounces of medical marijuana for the treatment of up to nearly a dozen medical conditions. Patients living more than 40 miles from a dispensary will be able to cultivate up to eight plants. The law will go into effect on December 8, when the Department of Health will begin the process to develop regulations to implement the program, including the processes for licensing businesses and enrolling patients.

<h2>MONTANA</h2>
Montana voters approved a compassionate medical marijuana ballot measure on Election Day by 55 percent. This is the second time Montana’s voters moved marijuana policy forward. In 2004, Montana became the tenth state to adopt a medical marijuana measure. In 2011, lawmakers replaced it with an unworkable system. On November 8th, the state’s voters restored patients’ medical cannabis access. This vote comes after years of court battles over the state’s 2011 law which limited providers to three patients and required the state to initiate an investigation into any doctor that recommended medical marijuana to 25 or more patients per year. Ballot measure I-182 not only rolls back those restrictive provisions, but it creates new regulations that include testing, protections for workers, and licensing for businesses.

<h2>ARKANSAS</h2>
The first state in the Bible Belt has voted to legalize medical marijuana. With the approval of Issue 6 on November 8th, the people of Arkansas have voted to allow patients with a variety of medical conditions and a doctor’s recommendation to buy marijuana from dispensaries. Patients won’t be allowed to grow their own. The measure allows people who have any of 18 qualifying conditions — such as cancer, glaucoma, Tourette's syndrome, Alzheimer's disease and hepatitis C — to access dispensaries.

<h2>MAINE</h2>
By a razor-thin margin, Maine became the eighth state to legalize recreational marijuana after Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Massachusetts, Nevada and California. The Maine Marijuana Legalization Measure, known as Question 1, which will legalize, regulate, and tax cannabis, passed with a reported 51 percent in favor. Question 1 is arguably more progressive than any of the legalization programs currently in effect. Residents will be allowed to grow twice as many plants as in Colorado and three times as many as Oregon. Maine’s visitors will be able to consume cannabis in social clubs, but public consumption will remain illegal.

<h2>FLORIDA</h2>
Last month an estimated 71 percent of Florida voters overwhelming approved a state constitutional amendment to legalize medical marijuana, broadening access beyond the limited therapeutic uses approved by the legislature two years ago. Currently, the law allows non-smoked, low-THC pot for patients with cancer or ailments that cause chronic seizures or severe spasms. The ballot measure, Amendment 2, formally legalizes medical marijuana, and broadens access for diseases with symptoms other than seizures or spasms. Amendment 2 also allows for the creation of medical marijuana treatment centers where medicinal marijuana will be cultivated and dispensed to patients and caregivers with doctor certification.

		<title>Patient trades 10 pharmaceuticals for CBD oil to treat mental illness</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;I like the way I am when I take this,&rdquo; says Kathy Grip, 55, of the CBD capsules she takes daily to combat mental health issues that include bi-polar disorder, OCD and <br /> major depression.</p>
<p>It took over a year for all of Grip&rsquo;s mental health issues to be diagnosed. During that time Grip says, &ldquo;I was not myself for like a year. I was really depressed. I was constantly crying and unhappy. I couldn&rsquo;t figure out what was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both her psychiatrist and primary care doctor prescribed multiple medications to help her. &ldquo;They kept trying different medications while they were trying to figure out what was wrong with me, mentally. Doctors don&rsquo;t talk to you to find out the inner core of your problems. They just want to prescribe this medication and that medication,&rdquo; says <br /> Grip, who was taking a total of 10 medications to manage her illnesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once I learned what was in most of the medications and thought about the things I was going through, it started making sense and I stopped taking them one by one,&rdquo; says Grip, who started replacing them with CBD capsules. &ldquo;Now I am down to taking none. I take a valium once in a while because I will have a bad moment, but that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grip started taking CBD or cannabidiol, the non-psychoactive part of the cannabis plant, three months ago. &ldquo;I started taking them and within less than a month, I was remembering things, I was happier, my mind was clearer. It was like I had been living in a fog with all the different medications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only did multiple pharmaceuticals leave her in a fog, but it was financially unsustainable. &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t have insurance, my medication would be nearly $3,000 a month. One pill alone was $400 per month. It costs a fortune. I was on 10 different medications at one time. But if somebody doesn&rsquo;t have insurance, the cost of the medicine they have to pay for would cause them to go broke. You have to decide if you want to take your medicine or deal with your mental problems on your own and eat -- it&rsquo;s one of the two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For those who are unsure about breaking from pharmaceutical medications to try cannabis-based medicine, Grip says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it can harm you any worse than drinking a beer. A lot of people think you are going to walk round high all the time. That was one thing I was worried about, that I would be stoned all the time, but I am not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But more importantly, Grip says, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to quit taking it because I am happy most of the time.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>By Richard S. Gubbe</em></p>


<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Medical researcher Philippe Lucas employed the use of cannabis as a tool to beat addiction long ago. But not like you might think.</p>
<p>While attending college in Ottawa, Canada, Lucas swapped alcohol and tobacco for smoking marijuana after being diagnosed with hepatitis C. Today, the cutting edge researcher is proving he was ahead of his time by investigating medical cannabis as a way to beat harmful addictions.</p>
<p>Through his research Lucas has found that Americans and Canadians are using the pain-killing properties of cannabinoids to suppress a growing crisis -- the opiate addiction epidemic. Once considered an evil gateway drug, many are finding the opposite to be true -- cannabis is now being studied as a formidable means to halt the use of alcohol, tobacco, opioids, and illegal illicit drugs. That&rsquo;s a discovery with big implications because alcohol, illicit and prescription drugs contribute to the deaths of more than 90,000 Americans every year, while tobacco is linked to an estimated 480,000 deaths per year.</p>
<p>We seemed to flip the script -- from being promoted as a stepping stone drug by our government through the kind of drug war propaganda that was being perpetrated,&rdquo; said Lucas. &ldquo;I was finding not only a gateway, but it had proven to be an exit drug from substance abuse and addiction. That got me more interested in studying the phenomenon more closely over the years. I&rsquo;ve put a number of surveys into the field to track patient use to examine the impact of cannabis use on the use of other substances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>FROM GATEWAY TO HELL TO GATEWAY TO HEALING</strong></h3>
<p>The term gateway drug was coined over 40 years ago, but, surprisingly, not with regard to marijuana. In the early 1970s, the National Institute on Drug Abuse gave money to Dr. Denise Kandel to research marijuana as a possible gateway drug. Dr. Kandel&rsquo;s research suggested it was actually nicotine, not marijuana, that was most likely to lead to the use of harder drugs because nicotine primes the brain for addiction.</p>
<p>When I did the analysis, I found that there was a certain sequence that young people seem to be following when they got involved in drugs. They did not start with marijuana, but they started with drugs that are legal for adults in the society, such as beer and wine and cigarettes, other forms of alcohol,&rdquo; Kandel recalled during an NPR interview in April 2015.</p>
<p>Over the years, Kandel&rsquo;s research was twisted and marijuana became maligned as a stepping stone to heroin and other illegal substances. To this day, marijuana is and continues to be promoted as a one-way path toward self-destruction.</p>
<p>Once viewed as a Hummer speeding down the highway to hell, cannabis, legal or not, has put the vehicle in reverse. Recent survey statistics point to a change in direction for cannabis, and researchers are starting to see it as a way out of the jungle of addiction that puts a stranglehold on the quality of human life.</p>
<p>Studies are showing that marijuana may not be the bad guy after all, instead, ironically, offering a way out of addiction instead of into it. Kick-starting the effort are the changes in criminal possession laws and the adoption of medical marijuana to treat illness. With access easing, addicts and those suffering from mental illnesses may now have a tool to replace harsher medications.</p>
<p>Substituting cannabis for a harsher substance has been termed everything from risky to logical. But while doctors and researchers debate the use of what has been derogatorily labeled a &ldquo;gateway&rdquo; drug in reverse, a research movement has emerged to study the use of cannabis to ease or even eliminate addictions especially with regard to the opiate scourge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>THE REAL GATEWAY DRUG IS IN YOUR MEDICINE CABINET</strong></h3>
<p>Oxycontin, Percocet, fentanyl, codeine, Vicodin, morphine...we have all heard of or taken any one of these opioids at some point. In 2012, 259 million prescriptions were written for opioids, which is more than enough to give every American adult their own bottle of pills.</p>
<p>Despite their ubiquity, the National Institute of Health (NIH) acknowledges that existing opioid medications have a range of side effects that make them &ldquo;problematic&rdquo; as pain treatments. NIH goes on to note someone who is physically dependent on a medication will experience withdrawals when the drug is abruptly reduced or stopped.</p>
<p>Opioids attach to specific proteins called opioid receptors, which are found in the brain, spinal cord, gastrointestinal tract and other organs. When these drugs attach, they reduce the perception of pain. Opioids can also produce drowsiness, mental confusion, nausea, constipation and impede respiration.</p>
<p>With an estimated 4.3 million Americans engaged in non-medical use of prescription painkillers in the last month, the skyrocketing number of opiate addictions has health officials and researchers scurrying to find alternatives to opioids. However, step-down treatments, synthetics and rehab centers using the standard addiction protocols have not stemmed the outbreak. New synthetics are on the way but with any drug, side effects are often worse than the opiate itself.</p>
<p>Researching synthetics as an alternative to opiates, NIH recently reported that &ldquo;teams of researchers synthesized a compound unrelated to known opioids that relieved pain in mice for nearly three hours -- much longer than the relief produced by morphine -- and with minimal side effects, including reward. The compound, PZM21, selectively relieves central nervous system-mediated pain by activating the mu-opioid receptor via a G-protein coupled receptor pathway. This breakthrough highlights the power of computer-based drug design. The unique chemical activity of PZM21 makes it a valuable tool to study opioid receptor biology, and is an important step toward the development of safer pain medications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>CANNABIS AS A SUBSTITION SOLUTION</strong></h3>
<p>Medical cannabis is overwhelmingly being used to treat pain and mental health conditions,&rdquo; Lucas told <em>elevate</em>. &ldquo;Neuropathic pain responds better to cannabinoids than opioids. We have an endogenous cannabinoid system just as we have an endogenous opioid system. And the cannabinoids and the number of terpenes that has recently been discovered binds specifically to the endocannabinoid receptors.&rdquo; The cannabinoids and terpenes &ldquo;work synergistically&rdquo; and lead to better appetite, memory and sleep with a &ldquo;multitude of cannabinoids and terpenes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The evolution of cannabis&rsquo; healing properties has given rise to a wave of new applications for &ldquo;substitution therapy.&rdquo; Substitution effect happens when the use of one product or substance is influenced by the use or availability of another and leading the way is cannabis.</p>
<p>A scholar at the Centre for Addictions Research of British Columbia, Lucas has spent the last 10 years proving his theory that the benefits of medical cannabis are many and now include substitution. He was the Primary Investigator in a four-site survey protocol examining &ldquo;substitution effect&rdquo; and associated harm reduction in medical cannabis users in British Columbia. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a big believer in harm reduction,&rdquo; Lucas explained. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re substituting a far more benign, safer substance for a substance that is not only dangerous as far as overdose, but also far more addictive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucas has seen a trend in his own studies and those of others in the field. His most recent survey published earlier this year, &ldquo;Cannabis as a substitute for alcohol and other drugs: A dispensary-based survey of substitution effect in Canadian medical cannabis patients,&rdquo; confirms medical cannabis is being used as a substitute for prescription drugs for chronic pain and mental health conditions.</p>
<p>Researchers teamed with staff from four medical cannabis dispensaries located in British Columbia to gather demographic data of patient-participants as well as information on their past and present cannabis, alcohol and substance use. A 44-question survey was used to anonymously gather data on the impact of medical cannabis on the use of other substances.</p>
<p>Over 41 percent state that they use cannabis as a substitute for alcohol, 36.1 percent use cannabis as a substitute for illicit substances, and 67.8 percent use cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs, the survey revealed. &ldquo;The three main reasons cited for cannabis-related substitution are &lsquo;less withdrawal&rsquo; (67.7%), &lsquo;fewer side-effects&rsquo; (60.4%), and &lsquo;better symptom management.&rsquo; This data suggests that many patients may have already identified cannabis as an effective and potentially safer adjunct or alternative to their prescription drug regimen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The study concluded, &ldquo;With 75.5 percent of respondents citing that they substitute cannabis for at least one other substance, and in consideration of the growing number of studies with similar findings and the credible biological mechanisms behind these results, randomized clinical trials on cannabis substitution for problematic substance use appear justified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>NOT SO FAST -- CANNABIS AS AN EXIT DRUG?</strong></h3>
<p>Studies aside, don&rsquo;t expect an onslaught of doctors telling patients under their care for addiction to heroin to jump on the bandwagon. Treating an addiction with an addictive substance may sound unstable, if not crazy.</p>
<p>Dr. Mel Pohl, M.D., of the Las Vegas Recovery Center, is certainly skeptical. He believes cannabinoids as a substitute are risky.</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t studied it well enough and which components are appropriate,&rdquo; Dr. Pohl said. &ldquo;We have legislated no real control or production standards. We <br /> have no idea what people are ingesting. My concern is safety for the patient. The other concern is the risk of going back is high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Pohl said any substitute should be &ldquo;a product low</p>
<p>in THC and high in CBD&rdquo; and noted that medical cannabis</p>
<p>puts the patient &ldquo;at high risk for other addictions. You can say the same thing about all the drugs that hit the dopamine system in the mid-brain,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;It puts the brain at risk because it can&rsquo;t tell where the drug is coming from.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of opioids but I don&rsquo;t think turning away without good studies is the right thing to do,&rdquo; said Pohl, whose Las Vegas Recovery Center uses holistic approaches to treat pain management with options that include a 12-step program, cognitive behavioral therapies, mindfulness therapy, acupuncture, massage therapy, yoga, gigong, Reiki, <br /> and exercise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>CANNABIS OFFERS HOPE AND HEALING</strong></h3>
<p>When you take something dangerous away from an infant, it should be replaced with something less dangerous. The laws, many of which are changing, and costs pose the main obstacles to finding something less dangerous.</p>
<p>The cost continues to be an obstacle to access,&rdquo; Lucas said of the biggest socio-economic factor facing cannabis. Specific socio factors, he noted, when cannabis was legalized in U.S. states included a reported decline in DUI-related deaths, domestic violence, homicides and suicides, and other violent crime.</p>
<p>But &ldquo;the goal is in sight,&rdquo; he forecasted, pointing to Netherlands and Germany as models. &ldquo;Insurers find that the patients have fewer visits, they use less prescription drugs and have better health outcomes overall. From an economic perspective, it makes sense for insurance companies to cover the cost. Private insurers are always interested in finding ways to save money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just Lucas, other researchers are also seeing health benefits as a result of decreased use of opiates stemming from legal access to marijuana. Dr. Marcus Bachhuber, who is a medical doctor with a master&rsquo;s of science in health policy research from the University of Pennsylvania, conducted research focusing on approaches to addressing prescription drug misuse. He found a 25 percent lower rate of opioid mortality in states with medical marijuana than in neighboring states.</p>
<p>The team of Bradford and Bradford found in a 2016 survey that prescription drug counts dropped for seniors in medical marijuana states compared to neighboring states.</p>
<p>Lucas&rsquo; 2012 study &ldquo;Cannabis as an Adjunct to or Substitute for Opiates in the Treatment of Chronic Pain&rdquo; published in the<em> Journal of Psychoactive Drugs</em> found that &ldquo;cannabis was substituted for all three classes of substances, suggesting that the medical use of cannabis may play a harm reduction role in the context of use of these substances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In combining all the studies, Lucas concluded, &ldquo;There is a growing body of evidence to support the use of medical cannabis as an adjunct to or substitute for prescription opiates in the treatment of chronic pain. When used in conjunction with opiates, cannabinoids lead to a greater cumulative relief of pain, resulting in a reduction in the use of opiates (and associated side effects) by patients in a clinical setting.</p>
<p>Additionally, cannabinoids can prevent the development of tolerance to and withdrawal from opiates, and can even rekindle opiate analgesia after a prior dosage has become ineffective. Novel research suggests that cannabis may be useful in the treatment of problematic substance use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noting opioids are the leading cause of accidental death in North America and that four of five people who inject heroin start out using prescription opioids, Lucas concluded, &ldquo;Give physicians a tool other than an opioid to deal with chronic pain, I think it would save a lot of lives and reduce a lot of suffering.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>Chewy Double Chocolate Chip Peppermint Candy Cannacookies </h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

6 Tbsp. unsalted butter, softened
2 Tbsp. unsalted cannabutter*, softened 
¾ cup granulated sugar 
1 whole large egg (room temp)
¼ tsp. peppermint oil (or natural 
peppermint extract)
1¼ cup unbleached all-purpose 
flour (or whole wheat pastry flour)


<p><i>*Chef&rsquo;s note: You may need to adjust the levels of unmedicated butter to medicated butter depending on the strength of your butter and desired dosage per cookie.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>Directions:</em></strong></h3>
<p>Preheat oven to 350&deg; F. In a large bowl, cream the two butters and sugar together for about 1-2 minutes. Add egg, peppermint oil or extract and beat until light and fluffy. Be sure to scrape down the sides as you go to ensure even mixing.</p>

<p>Add flour, salt, cocoa powder, baking soda and baking powder to a sifter and sift together. Gradually add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, and mix until well combined. Add chocolate chips and gently mix in dough. Cover finished dough and chill in the freezer for 10 minutes while oven finishes heating.</p>

<p>Form the dough into small balls (heaping 1 Tbsp.), and place 1-1/2 inches apart on an ungreased (or parchment lined) cookie sheet. Press down the tops of the cookies, and top with a few more chocolate chips. Bake for 10-12 minutes until the edges start to dry but the tops are slightly soft looking. Every oven temperature is different, so check for doneness at 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Let set on cookie sheet for a few minutes more but sprinkle crushed candy cane on immediately. Transfer to a cooling rack to rest until completely cooled. Store in an airtight container to keep fresh for up to a few days or freeze for several weeks.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Bloody Mary Canna-compound Butter</h2>
By Chef Melissa Parks, Vert Edibles
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

½ pound unsalted butter, softened 
½ pound unsalted cannabutter, softened
1 1/2 cups crushed tomatoes 
2 Tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons 
prepared horseradish 
2 Tablespoons Tabasco 
1 Tablespoon Worcestershire sauce 
2 teaspoons salt 
1 1/2 teaspoons ground black pepper 
1 teaspoon celery seed, slightly ground
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>Directions:</em></strong></h3>
<p>In a large glass bowl, bring &frac12; pound cannabutter and &frac12; pound unmedicated unsalted butter to room temperature. This will help with the blending of ingredients.</p>

<p>Puree all ingredients except cannabutter and unsalted butter. Add pureed ingredients to bowl of softened butters, fold all ingredients together. Make sure all ingredients are completely blended together. This may take a few minutes of mixing, but the extra time is worth it. The butter will have a better overall flavor profile as well as a more consistent THC mg dose per serving.</p>

<p>Once all ingredients have been well blended, place butter in food storage tub, and place in refrigerator to set. Make sure to label and date the butter.</p>

<h2>Eggnog Cheesecake With Gingersnap Crust </h2>
By Chef Jamie Lockwood, Evergreen Organix 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

<strong>FOR THE CRUST:</strong>
1 1/3 cups finely ground gingersnaps
2 Tablespoons melted non-infused butter

<strong>FOR THE CHEESECAKE:</strong>
24 ounces (three 8-ounce packs) 
cream cheese
2 Tablespoons melted butter and/or 
cannabutter, dosed to your liking 
1 cup sugar
1/4 cup flour
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
1 teaspoon salt
2 large eggs
1/2 cup eggnog
1 teaspoon dark rum
1 teaspoon vanilla extract

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong><em>Directions:</em></strong></h3>
<p>For the crust, spray a nine-inch springform pan with cooking spray. In a small bowl, combine cracker crumbs and butter. Press onto bottom of pan. Place pan on a baking sheet. Bake at 325&deg; for 10 minutes. Cool.</p>

<p>In a standup mixer with a paddle attachment, whip cream cheese until light and fluffy, and there are no lumps. Slowly add melted cannabutter while mixing on low speed. Scrape sides of bowl and mix again. Add sugar, flour, salt and nutmeg. Mix well, scrape the sides of the bowl and mix again. In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, eggnog, rum and vanilla. Slowly add to the cream cheese mixture while mixer is running on low speed. Scrape the sides of the bowl and continue mixing on medium speed until all ingredients are evenly incorporated. Pour and spread evenly over crust.</p>

<p>I like to bake cheesecakes in a hot water bath, this prevents overcooking. You can easily make one by using a large baking pan. Fill it up with an inch of boiling water. Then cut a large piece of foil, lay the springform cake pan on top of it and fold the edges up around the side of the pan to prevent water getting into your crust. Gently place your cheesecake pan into the larger baking pan filled with water. Bake for 50-60 minutes in a preheated 325&deg; oven. Refrigerate overnight. Cut into 12 servings, serve with whipped cream.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>EVERGREEN ORGANIX CHEF JAMIE LOCKWOOD FINDS PURPOSE IN MAKING EDIBLES</title>
		<link>https://elevatenv.com/evergreen-organix-chef-jamie-lockwood-finds-purpose-in-making-edibles/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;I love to bake, but now it's about baking with a purpose,&rdquo; Jamie Lockwood, 41, says of her job as Pastry Chef/Production Supervisor at Evergreen Organix. Lockwood has been baking with a purpose since 2010 when a friend asked her to make some edibles for her 80-year-old grandmother who had cancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made her a huge box of infused carrot cake cupcakes, and she would eat one every day. After a few weeks she had gained 10 pounds and was doing much better overall. That's when I realized that making edibles was what I really wanted to do with my life,&rdquo; explains Lockwood, adding, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s become my passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although she has always loved spending time in the kitchen baking for family and friends, it wasn&rsquo;t until Lockwood says, &ldquo;my husband suggested I should go to culinary school because he loved my pies and thought I should bake professionally that I pursued it. When I applied to culinary school, I knew it was meant to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A 2005 graduate of Cambridge School of Culinary Arts, Lockwood has been baking with cannabis since 2007, when she first got her medical card in California. &ldquo;Back then edibles were not always available in dispensaries, so you had to make your own. My self-taught journey began through trial and error, with a little help from the internet,&rdquo; Lockwood explains of her experience, which was more than enough for her to run the kitchen at Evergreen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I met with the Evergreen team, things just fell into place. I loved their vision -- homemade products with high quality ingredients,&rdquo; Lockwood says of her one-year tenure at the Las Vegas-based cultivation and production facility.</p>
<p>One of Lockwood&rsquo;s secrets to cooking with cannabis is understanding decarboxylation. &ldquo;When making cannabutter, decarboxylation is a very important step,&rdquo; she offers, emphasizing that you must not skip it. &ldquo;The cannabis must be spread on a baking sheet, covered and baked for one hour in a 240&deg; oven to activate the THC. Then you can cook it in a pot with butter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She also emphasizes the need for home cooks to be vigilant about ensuring even distribution every step of the way to accurately dose the food you are preparing. &ldquo;When incorporating cannabutter, it&rsquo;s very important that your butter is evenly distributed into your dough. At Evergreen, we take extra care to make sure the butter is completely homogenized into the recipe. This includes scraping down the sides of the bowl and giving it an extra mix every time you add an ingredient. Another point is to be careful of high temperatures. You should avoid cooking with cannabis at temperatures over 300&ordm; degrees because you can actually burn off the THC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For Lockwood, &ldquo;The best part about baking with cannabis is to know your food is also medicine, and medicine can taste great.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>VERT CHEF MELISSA PARKS IS ON A MISSION TO HELP PEOPLE NIBBLE THEIR WAY TO RELIEF</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;For me, it&rsquo;s about helping people,&rdquo; explains chef Melissa Parks. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this beautiful harmonious kind of coming together of science and food. They really balance each other out because you can add a certain herb to a certain extraction at a certain potency and it will be consumed by a patient to enhance or combat a symptom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parks, who is the executive chef for local edibles company Vert, found her interest piqued by cannabis after being approached by friends to make cannabis-infused edibles to treat health issues including various lymphomas, breast cancer, and PTSD.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had no experience with it,&rdquo; the 36-year-old Le Cordon Bleu graduate says of cannabis when her friends approached her about it. &ldquo;I decided to dive in head first because I love helping people and I also love producing good food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Diving in head first for Parks meant attending every conference or seminar on the subject she could find and joining as many groups as she could that were related to cannabis as well as eventually giving up her lucrative business as a private chef. During that time period she started working for an edibles company where she learned the ropes. &ldquo;I Googled one of the top edible companies in Colorado and I walked in there with 12 un-medicated samples of baked goods with my pink chef coat on and offered to work for free because I didn&rsquo;t really know what I was doing or where I was going with this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A week later she was hired and the company taught Parks everything there was to know about cannabis. &ldquo;They gave me a base from which to learn about the plant, to learn about the science of, or the beginning of how many scientific methodologies there are to understanding this plant,&rdquo; explains Parks whose work history has included everything from R&amp;D at General Mills to working on an organic farm in Colorado.</p>
<p>As easy as it was for Parks to find her way into the cannabis industry, it was a different story when she had to tell her parents about her career shift. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have been, but I was nervous,&rdquo; she said of phoning them with the news. &ldquo;I told them, &lsquo;I took a job as an edible chef.&rsquo; And my mom asked, &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t all of your food edible?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Well this is a little different, let me explain.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although her parents were a little skeptical at first they came around. &ldquo;With my dad being a doctor and my mom being a registered dietician, they both understood why I was doing it and my drive behind it, medically speaking, and they supported me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only did they support her, Parks&rsquo; father helped her. &ldquo;My father has a Ph.D. in chemical engineering so I worked with him specifically on dosing. When you have this wildly educated father who can help you through some of the chemistry, and the distribution and breakdown of molecules, it&rsquo;s nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Translating all of that chemistry to cannabis and cooking is simpler than you might think. &ldquo;The secret to cooking, to baking, to understanding it is practice, practice, practice as much as you can and understanding that failure is a part of that process and success is a part of that process. With each thing you have to recognize that it&rsquo;s all an opportunity to learn and to grow and get to know the science of this and that becomes something that you can own and share with others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for tips she would share with home cooks, Parks focuses on the different methods of cooking with cannabis. &ldquo;In any recipe you make at home, you can replace fat with a canna-butter or a canna-vegetable oil. You can do an in-home extraction where you are working with cannabis vegetable oil, cannabis olive oil or canna-butter. You can also work with a CO2 extracted cannabis oil. Those two styles of infusion make for different results, they also make for different flavor profiles,&rdquo; offers Parks. &ldquo;You also have to know at which point you have a burn off of your THC. It&rsquo;s up to the chef to keep their cookies or breads or pasta at that certain temperature and if you go above that, you have to recognize that there is going to be a burn off rate of THC, meaning you could burn off some of the milligrams in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parks also warns of understanding dosing and being aware of altering the flavor, texture and overall outcome of what you are making but, most importantly, reminds home cooks just to have fun. &ldquo;I take this stuff so seriously and probably to a fault because I am very stringent on my recipe development and dosages,&rdquo; concludes Parks. &ldquo;I have to remember to find the find fun in the industry as well, and keep a beautiful vibe in the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A TASTE SENSATION</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Justin Alexander
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the explosion of the craft cuisine movement, the medical-marijuana edibles industry has taken on the same momentum, with patients preferring this discreet and tasty way of consuming their medicine. A new breed of chefs specializing in edibles use the same preparation methods associated with the highest levels of culinary expertise -- creating options that go well beyond the standard cookies and brownies.</p>
<p>According to chef Melissa Parks, the way the powerful medicinal compounds enter the stomach and are then metabolized through the liver&mdash;THC converts to 11-hydroxy-THC&mdash;is completely different than when the herb is smoked or vaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The onset of your high is roughly 30 to 40 times longer for eaten versus smoked cannabis, and can take anywhere from 30 minutes to four hours, or, in some cases, as late as the next day to set in,&rdquo; Parks says. &ldquo;Edibles can result in a high that lasts between six and ten hours, depending on how much is consumed and one&rsquo;s tolerance level. This is three to five times the duration of the herb&rsquo;s high when smoked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the edible market expands, take a big bite out of this trend and incorporate feel-good food into your daily routine without the smoke but all the taste.</p>

<h3><strong>Start the Day Right </strong></h3>
<p>The breakfast of champions, Shango Granola not only relieves pain and insomnia, but is also richly filling and healthy for diabetics because honey is a key ingredient. &ldquo;My main focus was the diabetic patients that we were unable to reach due to a lack of healthy options. Honey is a natural sugar, making it an acceptable option," explains Maria Collazo, Executive Chef of Shango Las Vegas.</p>
<p>She recommends beginning with a one tablespoon serving. "Dosing depends on the patient, however, I feel that it is a great way to start the day and keep you going throughout the day as well," says Collazo. "I like to eat the granola two ways: I take three tablespoons layered in a parfait for breakfast that will give me the energy I need to get me going and keep away the pain from bodily aches due to standing 12 hours a day for years as a line chef. I also love to eat it with almond milk, blueberries, and bananas. Adding a tablespoon to your smoothie is a good way too."</p>
<p>Easy to consume and digest, the flavor profile matches that of store-bought granola and is a complement to acai bowls, yogurt and fruit. The rule of thumb: start low and go slow, as results manifest anywhere between one and up to four hours after consumption. A single dose equals around 10 mg, so always be sure to measure before digging in.</p>

<h3><strong>Drink Up</strong></h3>
<p>Thanks to tea and hot chocolate, cannabis is now appearing in gourmet beverages that promote wellness, relieve pain, energize, medicate and stimulate. Cannabis and caffeine creates a blissful synergistic balance that will change the way you think of your morning cuppa.</p>
<p>Sold at The+Source, Jane&rsquo;s Brew comes in Sativa, Indica and CBD strains that are fat-free, sugar-free and gluten-free and have no weedy aftertaste. Effects begin within 15 minutes and last three to five hours. &ldquo;Research suggests that the dynamic duo of tea and cannabis creates a natural healing &lsquo;co-action&rsquo; resulting in healthful therapies and treatment for a growing number of health-related issues and conditions,&rdquo; says Chris Vickers, general manager of The+Source. &ldquo;If you love hot chocolate or hot cocoa, the House of Jane has created a flavorful combination of rich, velvety hot cocoa and high-grade cannabis you&rsquo;ve got to try. Sweet and chocolaty, each cup of Jane&rsquo;s Brew Hot Chocolate is filled with warm, yummy goodness and therapeutic pain relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although doses can go as high as 200 mg, Vickers recommends starting with 10 to 20 mg. &ldquo;Edibles are [best] for patients with insomnia, Crohn&rsquo;s, irritable bowel syndrome, or even those looking for the anti-cancerous effects directly on the liver or digestive tract,&rdquo; Vickers says. &ldquo;For anxiety, depression, spasms and pediatric seizure disorders, you may do better with a moderate dose of a CBD-dominant remedy. Look for a CBD:THC ratio of more than 14:1. For cancer or pain, you may need more THC, for instance, a 1:1 ratio.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><strong>the Right Bite</strong></h3>
<p>Twenty-year food industry veteran Melissa Parks departed from designing wedding cakes and heading up research and development at General Mills with the advent of Vert Edibles, a line of cannabis-infused treats that feature familiar flavors. &ldquo;My aim was to create a product that was not currently on the market, was appealing to a wide range of patients, and provided health benefits from the cookie ingredients as well as the activated CO₂-extracted cannabis oil infused throughout the cookies,&rdquo; Parks says.</p>
<p>Her top priority is great taste&mdash;making things she would like to eat&mdash;and that is reflected in the sublime Key Lime Bites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to include as many organic ingredients as I could,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The Berry Bomb and PB&amp;J bites both have organic freeze-dried strawberries in the dough. The Key Lime cookies have real Key Lime juice, which came from Key West, Florida, and the mint cookies have organic mint leaves blended throughout. We also color and flavor all of our chocolate in-house. We take a lot of pride in not only producing a high-quality cookie, but a treat that tastes just as good as it is good for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In terms of dosing, she recommends paying close attention to what your body tells you. &ldquo;It is best to do your homework, ask questions and work with a doctor or caregiver who can assist you through the process,&rdquo; says the Vert chef, who co-authored the book &ldquo;HERB: Mastering the Art of Cooking with Cannabis.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is best to start with a low-dose edible and take your time getting to know how it affects your body. Everyone will have a different experience.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><strong>Just Desserts</strong></h3>
<p>It is hard to eat just one Evergreen Organix cakepop. In response to patient demand for a cupcake and due to the constraints of sealing such a product in protective packaging, a brainstorm session led to: &ldquo;let's give cakepops a try.&rdquo; From there, the team headed into the kitchen, making several un-infused batches first. &ldquo;We will have the team try four or five recipes before making small tweaks and getting the final product,&rdquo; says Jillian Nelson, operations manager for Evergreen Organix.</p>
<p>Each is dosed between 30 and 150 mg, providing a range of strengths, and, of course, portioning them out from there is also an option. Flavors include red velvet, funfetti, chocolate and the seasonally popular pumpkin spice. On the horizon, Evergreen will be unveiling strawberry, s&rsquo;mores and cookie dough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our cakepops are made from different flavors of cake mixed with either buttercream frosting or cream cheese,&rdquo; Nelson says. &ldquo;The mixture is then rolled into bite-size dough balls, dipped in a chocolate coating and garnished with different sprinkles, depending on the flavor.&rdquo; The strains used vary and alternate between flower&mdash;yielding better-quality oil&mdash;and sugar leaf. &ldquo;Strains don&rsquo;t really have too much of a specific effect because terpenes are often destroyed in the baking process,&rdquo; Nelson says. &ldquo;Since terpenes are not present in the final products, effects come only from the cannabinoids at that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As with all edibles, when it hits you depends on your metabolism, so start slow and wait until the effects&mdash;which can take anywhere from 30 to 90 minutes&mdash;begin before taking more. &ldquo;When a patient smokes, cannabinoids are absorbed via the lungs and have a quicker route to the bloodstream,&rdquo; Nelson says. &ldquo;Edibles have to first be digested in the stomach before traveling through the digestive track, where cannabinoids are eventually absorbed through the liver. This process takes a bit longer.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><strong>A Spoonful of Syrup...</strong></h3>
<p>The Apothecary Shoppe not only offers your typical edibles such as its crispy rice treat which has some added flair this holiday season with red and green candies and a festive drizzle of glaze, but they also have a signature product line developed specifically for pain and cancer patients.</p>
<p>Dr. Nick Spirtos, one of five doctors who own the Apothecary Shoppe, created Soothing Remedies watermelon syrup for patients who are suffering from the side effects of chemotherapy as well as those treating pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea is for it to help with people&rsquo;s appetite after chemotherapy. What tends to happen is the CBD has an anti-inflammatory effect and the THC helps with the appetite and aids the patient&rsquo;s immune system because typically after chemotherapy most people have a loss of appetite, they don&rsquo;t really eat, they start to lose the weight, and their immune system is what actually attacks them. Whereas, this helps with food intake and their hunger and they are able retain those nutrients from the food,&rdquo; the Apothecary Shoppe&rsquo;s Jennifer McClaning says of the medicated syrup that comes in three varieties: CBD, THC, and a 50/50 ratio of both. The recommended starting dose of Soothing Remedies syrup is 12 ml or about 2 teaspoons.</p>
<p>Made from original recipes formulated in-house, both the crispy rice treats and medicated syrup are rich in CO2 extracted cannabis oil and winterized so you get a lot of what you need and nothing you don&rsquo;t. &ldquo;Our chefs are constantly seeking to improve flavors so you can barely taste the THC, even though both products pack a potent dose,&rdquo; McClaning says of the dispensary&rsquo;s exclusive edible products.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>MARIJUANA-INFUSED  EDIBLES:  HOW ARE NEVADA’S CHILDREN  BEING PROTECTED?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Question 2, which allows for the adult use of marijuana in Nevada, including marijuana-infused products and edibles, passed last month. Leading up to Election Day on November 8th, there was a television and direct mail&nbsp;campaign against Question 2 that focused on edible safety. One such commercial claimed that children who went trick or treating next Halloween may be given marijuana-infused edibles in place of regular candy.</p>
<p>So the question must be asked, do current medical marijuana laws and regulations protect Nevada&rsquo;s children from ingestion of edibles? Will there be protection for children when adult-use marijuana stores open? Is there something more Nevada should do?</p>
<p>Under state regulations, all edible medical marijuana products must be packaged and labeled in a manner clearly indicating that the product contains marijuana and to keep it away from children. For instance, any product sold at a dispensary must still be packaged in child-resistant packaging, which includes marijuana-infused products, concentrated cannabis, and everything in between. Also, the product must clearly be labeled and such label indicates the product contains marijuana. The label contains various warnings including that the effect of the THC may be delayed by several hours. Therefore, if someone decided to hand out an edible marijuana product to a child at Halloween (which would be expensive and illegal), the child and/or an adult should be able to easily identify that the product contains marijuana.</p>
<p>The Medical Marijuana Program, which is overseen by Nevada&rsquo;s Division of Public and Behavioral Health, regulates all advertising, logos, labeling and packaging. No advertising, logo, label or package can be appealing to minors or utilize cartoons. The intent here is to avoid the &ldquo;Joe Camel effect&rdquo; where children will identify with the product because of the cartoon or packaging. It is anticipated that similar restrictions will be in effect under the adult-use market.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the industry has already taken steps to protect children from accidental ingestion of marijuana edibles. The Nevada Dispensary Association and its members have agreed to not carry edible products that are in the shapes of animals, cartoons or characters that may be more attractive to children. This means items such as marijuana-infused gummy bears are no longer available in most dispensaries as the industry is imposing restrictions upon itself.</p>
<p>In addition to all the current restrictions that are in place to protect children from accidental ingestion of edibles, some legislators are calling for even stricter requirements and perhaps even barring some products altogether. At the upcoming 2017 Nevada Legislative Session, the packaging, shape and markings of edibles, as well as the prohibition of certain types of edibles and education on edibles will most likely be discussed. Nevada may look to states such as Colorado for guidance. Colorado now requires all edibles to be marked with a symbol that indicates the product contains marijuana. Also, Colorado has put into place a restriction on certain types of edibles -- those that are in the shape of animals or people. Finally, Colorado has implemented an educational program on edibles and edible safety.</p>
<p>In my opinion, such an education program is critical for Nevada. Ultimately, it is the job of adults -- including parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, friends, etc. -- to keep their children safe. Nevadans, both adults and children, need to be educated on edible safety. If a universal symbol is adopted, like in Colorado, children need to know what that symbol means. Children also need to be taught that if a package is labelled a certain way, it is unsafe for them to consume. In addition, adults need to be educated on the proper usage and storage of edible marijuana products. Such an education program, in conjunction with the restrictions Nevada already has in place, will go a long way in protecting Nevada&rsquo;s youth from accidental ingestion of marijuana edibles.</p>
<p>Thus, while there are additional measures that can be taken, under the current regulations, it is unlikely that our children will unknowingly consume edible marijuana products next Halloween.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>NEVADA GOES ALL  IN ON CANNABIS</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?</strong></p>
<p>Last month Nevada voters legalized adult use marijuana -- passing the ballot measure known as Question #2 by a margin of 54 percent. This means starting January 1, adults 21 and older can legally possess up to 1 ounce of cannabis or one-eighth ounce of cannabis concentrate in the state of Nevada. However, even though adult-use goes into effect next month, there will be no place to legally purchase cannabis.</p>
<p>There are several scenarios in the works as to exactly <br /> when Nevada residents will be able to buy cannabis from a legal dispensary.</p>
<p>The state&rsquo;s medical marijuana dispensaries are overseen by Nevada&rsquo;s Division of Public and Behavioral Health, but a different department, the Nevada Department of Taxation, will be regulating adult use cannabis. Although this means a new agency has to get its bearings on the cannabis industry, they aren&rsquo;t wasting any time getting to work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Department is already working to develop temporary regulations,&rdquo; said Deonne Contine, executive director of the Nevada Department of Taxation, with regard to developing a task force to provide guidance on issues related to the passage of question 2. &ldquo;We intend to hold a public workshop very early in 2017 and then have our temporary regulations adopted so we can begin issuing licenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The temporary regulations will allow the department to begin issuing licenses while they complete the lengthier process of developing permanent regulations, which ultimately need to be reviewed by the Legislative Counsel Bureau.</p>
<p>In addition to workshops, the Department of Taxation plans to leapfrog off of the state&rsquo;s existing medical marijuana program. &ldquo;Because the medical (marijuana) program is up and running, the framework is already there,&rdquo; department spokeswoman Stephanie Klapstein told the <em>Las Vegas Review-Journal</em>. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just a matter of getting the regulations going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contine is confident moving forward. &ldquo;With the medical marijuana program in place in Nevada since 2014, we have expertise in the state on how to establish and carry out the regulations,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve also consulted with the industry in Nevada and looked closely at the regulation model in Colorado. We have a good foundation to do this right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If everything goes according to schedule, the Department of Taxation could issue its first temporary licenses by summer 2017, Klapstein said.</p>
<p>State Senator Tick Segerblom also has a plan. With the 2017 session of the Nevada Legislature set to begin on February 6, Senator Segerblom is considering a bill draft that is similar to what Oregon did after its residents voted to legalize adult use cannabis in 2014. Oregon&rsquo;s medical marijuana dispensaries received waivers from the state to sell recreational products temporarily until retailers could be licensed giving lawmakers time to complete the full regulations. Segerblom believes such legislation could grandfather medical marijuana dispensaries in quickly so residents have immediate access to lab tested and state regulated cannabis rather than turning to the black market.</p>
<p>A final scenario to consider involves the Paiutes. The Las Vegas Paiute Tribe, in partnership with New Mexico-based medical marijuana company Ultra Health, has licenses for cultivation, production and two dispensaries and is scheduled to begin selling medical marijuana in January. While the Paiutes and Ultra Health will be operating in Southern Nevada, they won&rsquo;t necessarily have to follow the same set of guidelines laid out by the state and local jurisdictions because they are a sovereign state that governs itself. In turn, they could begin selling adult use cannabis on their own timeline.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Dixie Brands launches in Nevada</h3>
<p>One of the biggest brands in the cannabis industry now has products lining the shelves of Nevada&rsquo;s dispensaries. With operations in Colorado, California, Arizona, Washington, and Oregon, Dixie is now selling its mints, chocolate bars, tinctures and topicals throughout the state.</p>
<p>Tripp Keber, CEO of Dixie Brands, and his team choose Nevada to set up shop for two reasons. One was the likelihood that adult-use would pass in November and the other has to do with Nevada&rsquo;s tourism base. &ldquo;I fundamentally believe that it is likely Nevada could be the epicenter of adult-use tourism associated with cannabis. That, coupled with the fact that we found an amazing partnership with Silver State Wellness, is why we came here,&rdquo; explained Keber. &ldquo;Certainly, we fundamentally believe that just like a Gucci or Louis Vuitton or Jos&eacute; Andr&eacute;s that it is important to have your brand represented in a state like Nevada. This is clearly one of our flagship facilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With 15,000 square feet of operating facility, Dixie will be introducing products into the Nevada market in two phases. During the second phase, Dixie will be rolling out its flagship elixir product and a line of higher dose chocolates.</p>
<p>Noting that one of the founding principles of Dixie is testing, Keber said, &ldquo;In the state of Colorado, for example, and certainly in Nevada and even in California, all of our products are tested typically no less than three times. In many cases, like Colorado, it&rsquo;s five times because we are testing for microbials, pesticides, etc. Testing, for us, is incredibly important. It&rsquo;s a commitment we have made from day one -- even prior to the testing requirement that was being implemented in a state like Colorado. So, for us, it was just business as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>NEW DISPENSARIES OPEN THROUGHOUT SILVER STATE</h3>
<p><strong>Top Notch THC</strong> is now open at 5630 Stephanie Street in Henderson, <em>topnotchthc.com</em>. <strong>The Clinic</strong>, <em>theclinicnevada.com</em>, has opened across from the Palms at 4310 W. Flamingo Avenue. <strong>Shango Las Vegas </strong>officially opened its doors last month and is located at 4380 Boulder Highway, <em>goshango.com</em>. <strong>Jard&iacute;n Premium Cannabis Dispensary</strong> is now open at 2900 East Desert Inn Road. In Northern Nevada, Rise dispensary has opened in Carson City at 135 East Clearview Drive, <em>risedispensaries.com</em>.</p>
<h3>Industrial hemp Takes Root in Tonopah</h3>
<p>One of the first hemp crops to be grown in Nevada since the cultivation of hemp became legal on January 1st was harvested in October. The 43-acre hemp crop in Tonopah, Nevada was grown by Agri-Tech Farms with support from Hemp, Inc.</p>
<p>"This was an experimental grow in an area not commonly known for farming, so this was a very unique situation. To our surprise, it did really well to be grown in high desert climate and it appears a significant amount of seed can be yielded from it, and as you know, the seed can be of great value," said Bruce Perlowin, CEO of Hemp, Inc. "Growing hemp is part of our strategic business model and with the success of this first groundbreaking industrial hemp grow, we're really excited to grow more, especially for CBDs."</p>
<p>"I think Agri-Tech Farms will get a lot of demand for the seed. Right now, there's a lot of experimentation with hemp farming going on. Factors such as seed shortages, poor germination rates and just plain inexperience have prohibited many of the farmers from yielding a full crop," said William Billings, CEO and founder of Colorado Hemp Project. &ldquo;You have to remember, hemp farming is a new business area, a relatively new adventure for farmers.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As head honcho of Oakland, California-based Oaksterdam University (OU), a business and horticulture college that educates patients, professionals, growers, elected officials and regulators on every aspect of the cannabis industry, Dale Sky Jones is in charge of a 150-member faculty and eight academic departments. Jones took over as President & CEO in 2012, carrying on the legacy of progressive cannabis education that began when OU was founded in 2007, educating more than 25,000 students in the process.

Nobody knew when I left my corporate job what I was going to do. I took the slow roll into this industry, I didn’t even talk about it for the first year. I told no one that I managed a doctors’ practice. I didn’t even want to talk about the fact that the doctors I worked for did cannabis recommendations, that’s how in the closet I was. I was keeping it quiet because I hadn’t figured out how to talk about it. But now, for me, it’s a moral imperative. I get it. Now I know how to talk about it. That is what I think I inspire in other people, I give them a way to talk about it. They are able to give voice to my words in the way that they own them. So I get where other people are coming from and I can authentically meet them where they are because I have been there -- I was that gal.

(Oaksterdam founder) Richard Lee kind of did this on a whim, almost as a joke at first. We were all talking about training but nobody was stepping up to do training in the form of a school. So he floats this ad in a few papers that basically says I will teach you how to grow pot, but first you have to learn politics and history and show up to city council meetings. It was a deal that was struck that was basically this:  I will teach you what you want to know but what I need is political support to move this issue forward and for you to become a freedom fighter.

We just finished training 41 agents and auditors from the Board of Equalization. We are training the trainers on how to audit the cannabis industry through a two-day intensive program.

Who better to help than the veterans who have lost their reason for living, they came back after being a part of something bigger than themselves to nothing. Losing purpose is one of the biggest reasons we are losing veterans to suicide. I saw a symbiotic opportunity for us to help each other and ourselves. We started giving free classes to veterans who couldn’t afford to pay. We gave them purpose again. This past Veterans Day, we gave away 30 free seats for veterans as part of the Freedom Fighter Scholarship fund.

Yes, we are opening a campus there in spring 2017. They are working furiously on it and I know we are going to be attached to a museum. It’s on Highland, off the I-15 in the old Goodyear Factory. We wanted to be here because Las Vegas is a very forward moving jurisdiction and they know how to manage their vices and sins. So while it’s not easy to do business in Las Vegas, it is reasonable to do business in Vegas.

You have to advocate down. Don’t forget the patients that got us here. This is not for fun. This is their life. We have to make sure we are developing programs that are going to help patients and poor people, and make these communities better than when we found them because you must have a good neighbor policy. You leave it better than you found it. That’s how you get support of your neighborhood, the church, the soccer moms, the school, your community. That’s the type of stuff that changes the world and that’s what I expect of my students and I tell them so.

		<title>TODDLER BEATS TERMINAL DIAGNOSIS  OF SCHINZEL GIEDION SYNDROME WITH CBD OIL</title>

<p>When Sadie Higuera was only eight months old, her parents were presented with a dire proposition. Sadie’s pediatric neurologist told the Higueras that they could be a “hero” to their infant daughter, who was experiencing approximately 300 life-threatening seizures a day, by agreeing to give her ACTH (Adrenocorticotropin).</p>
<p>“It’s a very, very heavy drug that would basically shut her down,” Sadie’s father, Brian Higuera, said of ACTH. “It was going to end her life. Fifty percent of the kids she’s ever treated with that drug had passed away. The doctor said in Sadie’s condition she thought it would be about a month. They told us we needed to be her hero and give it to her because there is not anything in the medical community that she knew of or anybody else knew of to help her.”</p>
<p>Within a few hours of leaving the neurologist’s office, the Higueras decided to be the hero their daughter, who was born with a rare genetic disorder called Schinzel Giedion syndrome (SGS), needed. Higuera had read an article about CBD oil and decided to eschew the neurologist’s advice and pursue medicinal cannabis instead.</p>
<p>The next day, after contacting eight doctors, he finally found one willing to meet with them. Higuera explained Sadie’s situation and the doctor agreed to meet with them but explained he wasn’t making any promises that he could help. After a consultation the doctor gave them a three-month recommendation for medicinal cannabis, suggesting they try RSHO (Real Scientific Hemp Oil). Higuera immediately picked it up at a dispensary and went straight home to put two drops under Sadie’s tongue and a quarter of a milliliter into her g-tube, which delivers nutrition directly to her stomach.</p>
<p>“After about 10 minutes I didn’t think her eyes were fluttering but I wasn’t sure because I was telling myself you just want to see this. Then in about 20 minutes her arms weren’t twitching anymore. After about 30 minutes, I tried to talk to her and she was looking at me and it was clear she was hearing me. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,” recalled Higuera.</p>
<p>Unable to watch her husband give Sadie RSHO for the first time, Higuera’s wife, Damaris, had taken their other two children to the park. She phoned 45 minutes later to check in. “I told her, ‘You need to come home’,” Higuera said of his wife who immediately panicked. He assured her, ‘Everything is fine, I just don’t want to put any ideas in your head. You need to get home and take a look at Sadie.’ She came back and looked at her for about 20 seconds and then started crying and said, ‘I got my baby back.’”</p>
<p>“It was profound to be told just three days earlier there is nothing that will help your baby to it all stopping,” Higuera incredulously observed. “It was a huge turnaround.”</p>
<p>Indeed, when Sadie was born her parents were told she would live six months to two years and that there was no known treatment for SGS. Sadie turned three last May and is now almost seizure-free, interacts with her family, shows progress and brain development, and attends a special needs class at her elementary school in Ramona, California.</p>
<p>A week after the Higueras started giving Sadie CBD oil, they returned for a follow-up appointment with the neurologist who recommended ACTH. According to Higuera, when the physician walked in the exam room she took one look at Sadie and said, ‘What are you guys doing? She’s completely different. I can tell she’s not seizing.’ The Higueras revealed they had started giving Sadie RHSO.</p>
<p>The neurologist asked why they hadn’t discussed it with her. “Well you were telling us to be her hero and end her life seven days ago and so we talked to a medical marijuana doctor instead,” Higuera told her. The neurologist was in total disbelief, but still had the presence of mind to ask for the Higuera’s phone number so she could give it to another patient whose child was also born with SGS.</p>

		<title>COMBAT PMS WITH CBD AND THC FOR A LITTLE TLC</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Julie Vigil</h4>
<h4>Photography by Timothy White 2015</h4>
</br>

<p>No one really likes to talk about it and no one really likes to go through it. It’s messy and inconvenient and it comes with a slew of unwelcome side effects: abdominal and lower back pain, headaches, weight gain, nausea, diarrhea, inflammation, swelling, bloating, depression, aggression, and moodiness, to name a few.</p>
<p>Worst of all, it’s too-often stigmatized, even in our modern world. It’s not spoken of in polite conversation, and those who suffer and dare complain are either gas-lighted and expected to deal with it, offered some over-the-counter pills and banal comfort tactics, or — worst-case scenario — are candidates for any number of expensive, invasive surgeries.</p>
<p>It’s no secret we’re talking about menstruation. Periods can be a bitch but they’re also a beautiful gift that lets women know we can make babies. And that truly is a miracle.</p>
<p>But when women — for the better part of 40 years, from puberty to menopause — have to endure a week-long, once-a-month thrill ride, is it too unrealistic to expect our 21st century technology and healthcare to offer some actual relief, let alone offer us a true remedy?</p>
<h3>Power that doesn’t stop with a period</h3>
<p>Our periods are supposed to be this beautiful thing, but who else is thinking Aunt Flo could use some better PR? She needs spin, a slogan, a positive image — and some serious products that will comfort and soothe us, ya know, stuff that’ll give ladies some TLC when we’re in our PMS world. Or better yet, give us some THC when PMS symptoms flare.</p>
<p>We don’t think that’s too much to expect. Thank the goddesses, Whoopi and Maya <br /> don’t either.</p>
<p>Comedienne, actor, “The View” host, and medical marijuana user and advocate Whoopi Goldberg joined forces with award-winning Om Edibles canna-business owner and infuser Maya Elisabeth to create a signature line of products designed specifically for relief from menstrual discomfort. Called Whoopi &amp; Maya Medical Cannabis (whoopiandmaya.com), the line of period pleasers come in four applications: Soak, Savor, Rub, and Relax.</p>
<p>“The whole line was Whoopi’s idea,” says Elisabeth. “She realized that more than half the population — 51 percent approximately — are experiencing an extreme discomfort one week out of every month, on average. And what an opportunity that is for us to create a product line for women to find relief and enjoy, have self-care, truly take care of themselves, and participate in something that is actually good for them, all while relieving menstrual discomfort. Cannabis is such a great ally for women. It’s such a powerful women’s herb and so many women I know, myself, of course, included, rely heavily on it for relief.”</p>
<p>The Whoopi &amp; Maya products are created by women for women and their unique needs during their cycles; however, that’s not to say these products can’t be enjoyed by men, too. Each one is made with all-natural, organic ingredients without any preservatives or synthetic fragrances.</p>
<p>“Cannabis does not discriminate,” muses Elisabeth. “She is so unconditionally loving and giving and generous and healing, whoever should decide to partake in any of these products will find relief — and I promise you won’t get a period from it.</p>
<p>“Our fragrance, Amber Moon, is so appealing to both sexes, it is very unisex-y; men love it, women go crazy,” Elisabeth continues. “The chocolate, there’s nothing wrong with men loving chocolate. I actually offer it under Om, it’s not a gender-specific product. The salt will bring anybody and everybody relief. Even the tincture will totally bring you relief and have some health benefits too, although I do believe the tincture is better for women because of the herbs that are in there.”</p>
<h3>Herb’s the Word</h3>
<p>The duo’s medical cannabis products are focused on easing targeted period needs by blending the best of traditional comforting practices — like soaking in a hot bath or applying a soothing muscle rub — with the healing help of either CBD or THC and specific essential oils and herbs.</p>
<p>The essential oils and herbs divined for the proprietary blends come from the creative endeavors of partner and herbalist Alexis Gandara. On the company’s website, Gandara explains how herbs play an important role in our well-being: “Herbalism has a big effect on the mind, the body, and emotions. Herbs can help us in a variety of ways: by granting relaxation, offering pain relief, reducing muscle cramping, strengthening immunity, and stimulating the senses. These physical effects also improve our mood and well-being. They invite us to honor ourselves. Feeling good and smelling good always help this out.”</p>
<p>Combining cannabis with all these powerful essential oils and healing herbs are intentional because they each bring benefits to the table. And since we have more than 200 cannabinoid receptors all over our bodies, cannabis is the ideal ingredient to relieve so many of our cycle symptoms.</p>
<p>“Cannabis is an analgesic — when used topically — which means it helps with pain,” Elisabeth explains. “And when you take it internally, it changes your relationship to pain, the way your body is perceiving pain. On top of that, it’s great for mood stabilization, anxiety, and depression. It is also helpful for nausea. It’s a powerful anti-inflammatory and can help you sleep. It’s such a miracle cure-all! All with no negative side effects. What are the side effects? Happy, hungry, tired?”</p>
<h3>Bath Balm</h3>
<p>Like your own mother might suggest, Elisabeth says a nice Soak is good for relieving stress and anxiety associated with menses. Hydrotherapy combined with aromatherapy ease PMS, aches and pains while lavender calms your entire nervous system. Plus the heat from the water makes your body release melatonin, which makes you tired, and the magnesium in the salts draw the toxins out, the ones that make you sore. One of the most efficient ways to receive magnesium is through an Epsom salt soak.</p>
<p>“Your colon is like a sponge and it’s constantly absorbing so when you sit in these magnesium salts, Epsom salts — which have been bringing athletes relief for thousands of years because they relax the muscles — it literally is like applying a topical to your uterus.</p>
<p>“I think these baths are in a category of their own,” she adds. “A topical affects you locally, an edible affects and alters your whole system, but the soak is doing both. It’s not really getting your head high, but it’s relaxing you, taking away anxiety, and the effect on the body is super. You just get so relaxed.”</p>
<h3>Savor the Flavor</h3>
<p>Medicinal cannabis chocolate is genius. First of all, what woman doesn’t like chocolate, especially at that time of the month? We crave it because there’s iron in chocolate and our bodies are losing iron from blood loss during our periods. Chocolate is also full of micronutrients and it stimulates the release of serotonin and endorphins, both associated with feelings of comfort.</p>
<p>“Raw cacao is the highest antioxidant-containing food on the planet. Plus, it is delicious and decadent. Savor is available in THC and CBD,” Elisabeth says. “It is six ingredients that you can pronounce: raw cacao butter, raw cacao powder, raw agave, coconut oil, sea salt, and cannabis. They are all organic, fair trade, gluten-free ingredients.</p>
<p>“You can make it into a drink,” she adds, “it’s very versatile. We like to add hot water mixed with hot hemp milk (or any milk or milk alternative of your choice), but we ask that people don’t boil it or microwave it because it is a raw, living superfood and that will kill its magic. You can also put it on fruit, nuts, toast, you can eat it plain with a spoon. We have not been disappointed with any of the creations so far.”</p>
<h3>Rub for Relief</h3>
<p>The tincture and the salve are multi-herbal creations. The salve is a beeswax base and it’s made with White Willow Bark, which is an analgesic just like cannabis (it’s actually the first herb that was used to make aspirin); it also contains Cramp Bark, which targets cramping; St. John’s Wort, which is great for mood elevation; and chamomile, which is very calming in an aroma-therapeutic way. Plus you get that whole layering of essential oils.</p>
<p>“Topicals have an incredible ability, when combined with the proper carrier oils, to go really deep and penetrate your system,” Elisabeth says. “Studies have found that cannabis topically can help treat things like endocarditis and go deep inside your internal organs. We do a proprietary blend of carrier oils that are also health beneficial and carry the medicine deep within your body.”</p>
<h3>A Tincture for Today</h3>
<p>The tincture is a versatile product all on its own. You can use it sublingually or add it to a beverage of your choice. It is designed as an analgesic to take away pain so you can work and stay active. Depending on how much THC you want, which is clearly marked on the bottle, you can decide your serving size.</p>
<p>Alongside the cannabis are a powerful combination of herbs, such as Raspberry Leaf which is a uterine toner; Motherwort and Passionflower, both of which are very relaxing and sedative; Elderberry, which enhances the immune system; and Cramp Bark, which as its name implies, relieves cramping.</p>
<p>“The tincture holds an extremely special place in my heart,” Elisabeth says, “because we’ve gotten multiple testimonials back from women saying that their next cycle has been improved. When a women’s next cycle is shorter in duration, with brighter blood and less cramping and less pain — that blows my mind because you’re moving from acute symptom relief to an overall lifestyle enhancer and that is definitely attributed to the herbs that are in that tincture.”</p>
<h3>Mixing Elixirs</h3>
<p>Choosing which Whoopi &amp; Maya product to use, whether to include THC or CBD, and how much medicine you use, are individual decisions. The CBD products and the topicals are not psychoactive while the THC cacao and the THC tincture are psychoactive.</p>
<p>The Whoopi &amp; Maya line is about versatility and options and relief on all different levels, and it’s made so you can use a product alone or in harmony with the others.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing wrong with drinking the chocolate while you’re in the bath...and then applying the salve,” she says. “There’s nothing wrong with using the tincture and the salve. Depending on what your day is looking like, if you’re at work and you’re in a lot of pain and you don’t want to feel altered and have a big meeting coming up, then the CBD chocolate would be a great choice.”</p>
<p>With Whoopi &amp; Maya products on the market in California (with the possibility of branching out to other states including Nevada), there’s hope on the horizon for more women and their monthly visitor. Anything that can effectively address so many symptoms and can even anecdotally hint at making your next period easier is a big win in any woman’s playbook.</p>
<p>“Cannabis miracles are real and sometimes all it takes is a topical,” sagely advises Elisabeth.</p>
<p>Looks like Aunt Flo found her new slogan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Maria Collazo, Executive Chef, Shango Las Vegas</h4>

<p>Chef Maria Collazo not only cooks with cannabis, but she is also a patient. After a grueling stint working in a restaurant at a fishing and hunting lodge in the Alaskan bush, Maria developed ligament and tendon issues from standing and working 15- to 18-hour days. “Medicating with cannabis got me through it all. But, after three seasons, I had done so much damage to my body that my doctors advised me it was time to make a career change,” she explains. “I was devastated. I still had a passion for cooking, and couldn’t imagine that it would no longer be a part of my everyday life.” Maria moved to Las Vegas and became a medical cannabis patient to treat not only her physical pain, but also her new anxiety about finding a different career. One day, her caregiver visited a local dispensary and picked up an employment application for Maria thinking it would be the perfect solution for her. “So, I went for it and, much to my surprise, I was hired. My pain has all but subsided and I’m still involved in Culinary Arts. I thoroughly enjoy being a part of the Shango team and doing meaningful work that really helps other patients like me.”</p>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

6 oz. Alaskan halibut filet
3 shallots, thinly sliced
2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
1 Granny Smith apple, diced small
3 Granny Smith apple slices (for garnish)
1 Tablespoon of apple cider vinegar
1 Tablespoon of red wine vinegar
1 Tablespoon fresh thyme
1 Tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
2 oz. pine nuts, toasted
3 Tablespoons of dried red currants
1 cup cooked farro (Israeli couscous 
can be substituted)
2 oz. cannabis-infused olive oil plus 
3 separate Tablespoons (total THC 
potency: 20 mg)
salt and pepper to taste

<h3>DIRECTIONS FOR FARRO</h3>
<p>In a large sauté pan over medium-low heat, sauté shallots, garlic, red currants and diced apples with 2 Tablespoons of cannabis olive oil. Cook until the shallots are translucent (about 5 minutes). Add the vinegars and stir.</p>
<p>Fold sautéed mixture and diced apples into cooked farro along with the chopped herbs and 2 oz. of cannabis olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>

<h3>DIRECTIONS FOR GRILLED HALIBUT</h3>
<p>Season filet with salt and fresh cracked pepper to taste. Place on a greased pre-heated grill. Cook for 4 minutes and turn a quarter of the way (to get those beautiful grill marks) and cook another 4 minutes or until it reaches desired doneness.</p>

<p>Place grilled halibut over the farro and brush it with the remaining 1 Tablespoon of cannabis olive oil. Garnish with apple slices.</p>

<p><em>Please remember when cooking with medicinal cannabis you are cooking with a medicine and the medicine amount and portions of the food ingested should always be taken into consideration. Always start out with small portions or doses and wait 30 minutes to an hour before eating any additional portions of food that has been medicated.</em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Justin Alexander
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are new to the cannabis scene and interested in medicating with it, the best place to start is by understanding the difference between indicas and sativas.</p>
<p>From flower to concentrate, sativas are a great way to jumpstart the day by giving you not only the energy to keep you going, but also a “cerebral” high that is filled with creativity and uplifting thoughts. Great for fighting depression, sativas offer feelings of well-being and stimulation.</p>
<p>If you are treating body pain, migraines, seizures, or stress and anxiety, than indicas are what you need. Indicas will make you sleepy and provide deep relaxation.</p>
<p>For those who are resolving to get a lot done in 2017, want to try something new for increased focus, or fight off depression, here are a few variations to explore the happiness high that is pronounced in sativas.</p>

<h3>Evergreen Organix’s Skywalker OG vape oil</h3>
<p>Vape oils are the preferred method when you need medicine fast and smoke-free. Priding itself on employing clean oil, not cut with any fillers or additives, Evergreen Organix uses a refined CO2 extraction process. With the Skywalker OG strain, all of the exemplary characteristics of the flower are there—sweet, earthy and pungent—since the extraction method preserves most of the original terpenes. Skywalker OG is best used for pain relief and deep, yet, focused relaxation with 72.25% THC and .26% CBD. Every puff takes you deeper into the day’s journey.</p>

<h3>Kynd’s Sour Diesel disposable vape pen</h3>
<p>One of the top selling strains of all time, Sour Diesel is the go-to for many ailments that include pain management, migraines, depression, and general stress. It’s known for its euphoric and calming vibe, washing away all the woes and casting a pleasant hue on the day’s activities. In the form of a vape pen, the benefits are multiplied due to a supercritical CO2 process that allows for the selective extraction of whole plant compounds. The characteristics of the strain really pop in this form with the flavor and effects magnified in smaller dosages and in a more discreet consumption method. Kynd’s Sour Diesel is 63.1% THC and .23% CBD. The pungent diesel notes are an undeniable and delicious bonus.</p>

<h3>Matrix’s Strawberry Lemonade flower</h3>
<p>The Matrix team takes pride in its cultivation techniques as all products are flushed a minimum of 10 days prior to harvest and each bud is hand trimmed. Like its name implies, Strawberry Lemonade is a sweet, yet refreshing flower with heavy notes of lemon, strawberry and citrus. It brings joy like a bright summer day and produces an overall relaxed, happy and energetic high with a THC count of 30% and less than one percent CBD. Stay hydrated to prevent dry mouth and also practice moderation to avoid an opposite effect—couch lock. Those battling depression and stress will greatly benefit from the sunny disposition this strain offers.</p>

<h3>The+Source’s THC Distillate Syringe</h3>
<p>Thanks to a sativa-dominant hybrid distillate you can boost your flower with an extra dose of pure THC testing in at 80%. Distillate is a game changer when it comes to dabbing and cooking, as it is potent and highly refined. Made by taking a concentrate and distilling it into an even more isolated form of THC, patients can drip it on hits or add to shatter and resin for the ultimate dab. The+Source’s THC distillate syringe packs an exuberant punch with a consistency that is thick, like glue, with no odor but hits you with an earthy pine note in the back of your throat after ingesting it.</p>

<h3>State Flower Cannabis’ Green Goddess, a.k.a. Green Crack or Dream Queen</h3>
<p>Green Goddess reached pop culture infamy thanks to Snoop Dogg dubbing it “green crack” for its uplifting high. A fatigue fighter, this strain is grown hydroponically at State Flower Cannabis’ (SFC) Las Vegas headquarters. Taking a lead role in sustainability, SFC—helmed by two friends who have been cultivating cannabis for more than 12 years—reclaims and filters “100 percent of the condensate water from our HVAC system and uses a recirculating irrigation system that requires less than 1/10th of the water consumption of conventional agriculture,” Daniel Wacks, co-founder of SFC, says of Green Goddess, which he notes is free of pesticides and plant growth regulators. Shorter than most sativa plants and with dense buds, Green Goddess has a super smooth, earthy taste mixed with sweet notes that tests 21.6% THC and .07% CBD. “Bright green flowers, crystalline cannabinoids, and distinctive orange pistils, mingle to create a perfectly pleasing pop of fresh pineapples and mango flavored bubblegum,” describes Wacks of Green Goddess, which is available at The Apothecarium Las Vegas.</p>

<h3>Moxie’s Orange Cream distillate vapor pen</h3>
<p>In need of immediate pain relief, reach for a frothy treat like a creamsicle and if one of those isn’t available, try Orange Cream Liquid Moxie. This distillate lives up to its dreamy, evocative name and while it’s not really a sativa—since distillates are not strain specific—the taste and effects are super awesome, super sweet and citrusy, and very strong—achieved through a fractional distillation process that creates clean oil. “Our distillate oil is generally from trim,” says Moxie’s Mike Tulimero. “Plant fats, lipids, terpenes, and other contaminants are separated out during our distillation process. So even if it were extracted from a specific strain, those strain-resembling traits would have been filtered out. This process results in a clean, potent oil with around 95% activated THC. After we add our vaporizing agent, MCT or Medium Chain Triglyceride, which is organic and water soluble, and our terpene profile, which are all naturally derived terpenes found in cannabis, you are left with a 50 to 60% potency pen that tastes clean and vaporizes well.”</p>

<h3>Cannabiotix’s Tropicanna flower</h3>
<p>Garnering numerous awards for its taste and quality, Cannabiotix’s Tropicanna is a cross between Pineapple/Kali Mist and Northern Lights #5/Haze. Sweet and citrusy, like a burst of juicy pulp, the high is buzzy and gives beautiful cerebral alertness with a THCA of 33.6% and CBDA of .11%. Taking pride in products that are free of plant growth regulators and flushed for 14 days, Cannabiotix is one of the cultivators to watch in Nevada’s medicinal cannabis industry. Tropicanna is sure to become a classic on the scene, much like its iconic Strip-based hotel namesake.</p>

<h3>Silver Sage Wellness’ Jilly Bean flower</h3>
<p>A dose of tropical flavor with notes of orange and mango, Jilly Bean induces a feeling of freedom with a blissful and elated vibe testing at 18.78% THC and .03 CBD. Jilly Bean is highly recommended for those engaging in creative pursuits who need focus and euphoria bundled for long-term engagement. Its genetics can be traced to Orange Velvet, Romulan, and Cindy 99, but this strain is definitely 60/40 sativa-dominant with radiant effects.</p>

<h3>Kabunky’s Gorilla Glue #4</h3>
<p>A hybrid that has a tendency to glue you into whatever you need to do, Gorilla Glue #4 helps with loss of appetite and shreds through pain and depression leaving a relaxed, happy and uplifted feeling. One of the new classics, Gorilla Glue’s earthy flavor is a must-try for those who love Diesel strains and prefer <br /> to medicate with a potent 20.06% THC cannabis <br /> flower. A pale green color, the buds are thick and pillowy, resembling clouds of moss with an earthy smell to match.</p>

<h3>State Flower Cannabis&rsquo; Lambsbread (the King's Cut)</h3>
<p>Slow-dried, hand-trimmed and carefully cured, Lambsbread is a Jamaican landrace that is nearly 100 percent sativa with 19.1 percent THC and .05 percent CBD. A classic for all who have tried it&mdash;the aroma is sweet and savory with notes of plantain, beet and dried fruit. Effects are jubilant, uplifting and energetic, eliminating stress, anxiety, depression and ADHD. Here are some bonus facts for trivia enthusiasts: it is said that rural growers would allow their sheep to eat the lower leaves of the plant for food to avoid having to defoliate the plants themselves.</p>
<h3>Silver Sage Wellness&rsquo; Durban Poison</h3>Ideal for daytime use, Durban Poison is 100 percent sativa with genetics originating from the African landrace strain. Its smell and taste are distinct with notes that can be characterized as spicy and chocolaty. Like downing a double espresso without any of the jittery effects, this will wake you up and get you going. Durban Poison is recommended for ailments such as nausea, headaches, chronic pain, anxiety and stress.</p>

<h3>Silver Sage Wellness&rsquo; Island Sweet Skunk</h3> 
<p>A descendant of Skunk #1, the fragrant smell of Island Sweet Skunk is as its name suggests&mdash;downright intoxicating. Offering beckoning notes of an exotic island with every puff, Island Sweet Skunk is earthy, citrusy and tropical. A strain that gives you the ability to function at a heightened level, it demonstrates all the alertness properties for which sativas are preferred, helping with anxiety, hyperactivity, inattentiveness, inflammation, migraines and stress.</p>

<h3>Silver Sage Wellness&rsquo; Outerspace</h3> 
<p>Looking for an all-around dazzling experience? Reach for Outerspace. A mix of genetics from Island Sweet Skunk and Trinity, this strain is citrus-forward and super flavorful. Relieving anxiety, depression, fatigue, hyperactivity, migraines and mood swings, Outerspace gets its name from the sparkly trichrome covered buds that resemble stars in outer space.</p>

<h3>Silver Sage Wellness&rsquo; Clementine</h3> 
<p>Made by Crockett Family Farms in California, Clementine has genetics from both Lemon Skunk and Tangie. This radiant 70/30 sativa will never slow you down or make you lethargic -- awakening both the mind and the body. Like a helpful friend on a bad day when facing depression, Clementine has a euphoric vibe and notes of sweet orange and citrus that remedies stress, inflammation and headaches.</p>

<h3>The+Source&rsquo;s Strawberry Lemonade Vape Pen</h3> 
<p>Strawberry Lemonade is a sativa-dominant hybrid and&mdash;and while exact genetics are unknown&mdash;it is thought to be Lemon OG and Strawberry Cough. Its taste matches its smell for a wonderful symphony. Packing a flavorful punch like a rich, juicy candy, it can be as sweet as a glass of strawberry lemonade. With mood stabilizing effects, expect a happy, energetic, and uplifting experience, but also complete relaxation when it is time to switch off. Rich in&nbsp;limonene at over 3.5 percent and beta-pinene, this strain helps with reducing inflammation and inhibiting cancer cell growth. Consume for depression, pain, nausea, migraines and social anxiety.</p>

<h3>Evergreen Organix&rsquo;s Rosin Candyland</h3>
<p>Made by pressing flower under heat and high pressure, this rosin is a result of a solvent-free extraction method to remove cannabinoids and terpenes from the flower and create a shatter-like concentrate. Rosin has a high, potent dosing factor at 65 percent THC and a CBD of .13 percent. Both stimulating and uplifting, and like its whimsical name, look for Candyland to relieve depression.</p>

<h3>Matrix&rsquo;s Super Sour Diesel</h3>
<p>One of the most popular sativa strains on the market, Matrix Super Sour Diesel is grown pesticide-free so it is good for the body as well as the mind. Most often used to tackle pain and depression, you can also immerse yourself in the pungent flavor while the creativity and euphoria quickly manifests. Call your friends, make plans and enjoy the social spark of Super Sour Diesel.</p>

<h3>Cannabiotix&rsquo;s L&rsquo;Orange</h3>
<p>With Cannabiotix&rsquo;s strong reputation, you know you will get something that smells like the name and L&rsquo;Orange doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. The intense stinging orange odor makes you happy before you even smoke it and it packs a zesty and spicy punch. Use it for nausea as it comes on fast and provides quick body and mind relief. Uplifting and euphoric with a high-energy rush, this is a take-first-thing-in-the-morning medicine with stunning mood elevation. Use a very low dose and it takes away the tired.</p>

<h3>Cannabiotix&rsquo;s Strawberry Lemonade</h3>
<p>Cannabiotix has earned a reputation for quality. Their flower comes frosty and beautifully trimmed and the appealing name makes you want to get into it quickly. Strawberry Lemonade smells like the name: fruity, citrus, fresh and fragrant. The taste is both sweet and earthy with bitter lemon undertones. We can describe this as a super sativa with a pleasant rush coming over you right after consumption and the ensuing big happy vibe with cerebral perks will make you jump for joy. This is love at first hit as Strawberry Lemonade is perfect for creative types and is smokable throughout the day, giving you a high capacity to function.</p>

<h3>Kabunky&rsquo;s Golden Strawberries</h3>
<p>As sunny as the name suggests, Golden Strawberries is a delightful sativa that will put stress at ease and give a multitude of uplifting effects without any paranoia. Recommended for symptoms of all kinds from mild to severe, those with anxiety will find this is a tasty daily go-to for a happy high. Make sure to stay hydrated to combat any kind of dry mouth that is commonly associated with powerful sativas.</p>

<h3>Kabunky&rsquo;s OG Kush</h3>
<p>A popular choice for those with migraines, high levels of stress, and ADHD, OG Kush is a highly lauded strain known for its big euphoric high. And when you smell and taste its earthy, wood notes and sour lemon flavor, you will come to understand the undeniable attraction of this varietal. OG Kush relaxes you and makes you hungry&mdash;two great feelings&mdash;and also relieves depression and insomnia without any speed-like effects.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“I’m here to tell you, as a doctor, that despite all the talk about the medical benefits of marijuana, smoking the stuff is not going to do your health any good.”</p>
<p>Those are the words of Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a column he wrote for <em>Time </em>magazine eight years ago.</p>
<p>It seems hard to believe now as Dr. Gupta has become almost synonymous with cannabis as a result of his "Weed" documentary series on CNN (although he begs to differ about the synonymous part, but more on that later).</p>
<p>He was emphatic in the <em>Time</em> piece, surmising of those voting to legalize marijuana in 2009 in Nevada and Colorado that “many of them just want to get stoned legally. That’s why I, like many other doctors, am unimpressed with the proposed legislation, which would legalize marijuana irrespective of any medical condition.”</p>
<p>Three “Weed” documentaries later (2013, 2014 and 2015) and with a fourth on the way later this year, having clearly changed his stance, Dr. Gupta is, today, just as emphatic about the medicinal and healing value of cannabis.</p>
<p>“Not only can it be of benefit, but sometimes it can be the only thing that is of benefit as we saw with the very refractory epilepsy and, maybe, even some of these cases of neuropathic pain. That’s powerful, that’s really really powerful to me. And forget that I am doctor, it’s probably immoral to not allow people to have relief from something -- especially when they can’t find it in any of the existing modalities that are being prescribed to them. I think it probably borders on immoral, or maybe it just is immoral,” he concludes.</p>
<p>When the neurosurgeon reflects on his journey with cannabis from non-believer to someone who’s “goal is to keep this very important conversation going,” Dr. Gupta is disconcerted by the idea that initially he didn’t take cannabis seriously as a medicine.</p>
<p>“The idea that the substance could be a medicine was the most surprising, and it sounds silly to almost say that, because to me, now that I have spent years really looking into this, I am a little embarrassed to have had that realization because -- what the hell was I doing before?,” he candidly wonders. “But I do think that there is a culture inflection with science in the sense that even if you are learning about the cannabinoid system and learning about the substance and the various neurotransmitters, it is still done under the context of this as a substance that is demonized and disparaged and I fell into that camp.”</p>
<p>Dr. Gupta reasons he fell into that camp because U.S. studies were never designed to find the benefits of cannabis. “The system was designed to find the harm and those were the studies getting funded, not studies that were designed to look for the benefit. But the point is you had a distorted picture of what marijuana could do. When you start looking at labs that aren’t dependent on some sort of state or federal funding or labs that are outside of the U.S., a very different picture emerged.”</p>
<p>Even with a lack of particularly compelling research, the premise behind the first “Weed,” which took 18 months to create, was to put a spotlight on medical marijuana because it was increasingly finding its way onto state ballots, and so as CNN’s chief medical correspondent, Dr. Gupta believed people should be informed.</p>
<p>Surprising and, yet, not surprisingly there was no detailed framework laid out before Dr. Gupta began filming the first “Weed.” “Frankly, when we first started thinking about “Weed” 1, I thought it was going to be looking at the science and the science still wasn’t particularly compelling. I did not have a real preconceived notion other than what I had learned before about medicinal marijuana and I was not particularly impressed by the literature at that point. It was more of an eyes-wide-open experience, certainly for the first documentary.”</p>
<p>He didn’t foresee the story of Charlotte Figi, who Charlotte’s Web is named for, would dominate both the first “Weed” documentary and the ensuing national conversation about medicinal cannabis. “We were following these people along with some of the scientists. Some of the studies were ongoing and some of the data came back even during the filming of our documentary so there was a lot we didn’t know other than the biggest, sort of broadest brushstroke of what we wanted to pursue,” Dr. Gupta further explains. “Even with the other ones (“Weed” 2 and 3), I didn’t know how the stories of these cannabis refugees were going to play out. I didn’t know if people were actually going to move, leave their homes and go to a different state.”</p>
<p>When “Weed” first came out, Dr. Gupta thought people would “challenge, criticize and ridicule it,” he also believed at the time “that there would be some people who would get something important out of this. My thinking was maybe it influences somebody with a child with Dravet syndrome and all hope is not lost and that, maybe, there is something else.”</p>
<p>Although Dr. Gupta was prepared for criticism, he didn’t foresee how quickly the dark shadow of stigmatization would begin to fade after the first “Weed” aired in 2013. “I didn’t think we would start to see the political movement around it and, to be fair, there was already political movement around it -- it wasn’t like I started it by any means. But I do think that the acceptance of states in the south, like Georgia and Alabama, where I would not have ever thought that this would remotely pass, or that it would even be on the ballot, has been pleasantly surprisingly.”</p>
<p>As for the content of the fourth “Weed” documentary slated to come out later this year, Dr. Gupta is still working on it but thinks the fact that eight states passed some form of legalized cannabis during the November presidential election will definitely factor in. “Our bend is going to be changed because of this election, but still very much predicated on evidence-based science.</p>
<p>“You can’t completely disentangle those two issues, they are entangled. But, if anything, I think we are still going to be leaning toward more of the evidence-based science behind this issue to the extent that evidence-based science can and should inform policy. I think that’s going to be a big part of what we talk about and whether or not that is presenting things to the cabinet or elected officials and seeing what happens with the CARERS Act (The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States Act introduced in March 2015) will be really important.”</p>
<p>Moving away from cannabis policy, which can be exasperating on its own, Dr. Gupta continues to be flummoxed by the lack of research in the field, especially for queries as simple as: is cannabis a preventative medicine?</p>
<p>After a long pause considering the question, he works his way to an answer. “I struggle with these questions a little bit and it’s frustrating because we, I, should be able to answer that question without hesitation. This plant has been around a long time and we have had decades to be able to answer this question, but because of the system we have not been able to do those sorts of studies.</p>
<p>“Yet, the idea of healthy people using it,” he pauses again thoughtfully, “...it’s a Schedule I substance so how do you go from saying it’s a Schedule I substance to, by the way, we would love to try this in healthy people? It’s totally doable but, again, there’s not enough evidence.”</p>
<p>The problem with research, though, is finding scientists and researchers who will put up with the hassles of cannabis’ classification as a Schedule I drug. “I think there’s a lot of really smart young scientists who are trying to figure out what they want to do with their lives, where they want to make their mark in terms of scientific progress who are very interested in this topic, but are probably not going to do it because they will get looked at sideways from their professors or worried that they can’t get the funding to get it done.”</p>
<p>However, once federal prohibition gets lifted, which Dr. Gupta estimates a five-year timeline as being realistic, the culture will shift. “When the signal comes, in terms of an end to federal prohibition, I think there will be a lot of obvious things that happen in terms of access and research dollars. I think there will be some less intuitive things that will happen as well and I think a lot of that will happen among my colleagues in the scientific community who will be much more likely to study this and progress it.”</p>
<p>One of the areas in most dire need of research is the nation’s opioid epidemic. New statistics from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released in December show that overdose deaths rose 11 percent in 2015, to 52,404, which is the most ever.</p>
<p>“It’s a horrifying statistic to think about the number of people who die from opioid overdoses. It’s the number one cause of unintentional death, of which 60 percent are made up from prescription opioids,” Dr. Gupta incredulously points out. He continues, “At some point, somebody is going to come to us from another planet and look at us and say, ‘Let me get this straight, you guys are literally killing yourselves, accidentally, using a medication that is supposed to relieve suffering and pain?’ It makes no sense.”</p>
<p>Also senseless to Dr. Gupta are the moral implications of keeping cannabis illegal. “In none of my documentaries did I ever get into the concept of moral equivalence because I thought it was too easy, too cheap, right?,” he questions. “I wanted everything to stand on its own merits. But in the back of my mind, I couldn’t believe we have this substance out there that kills somebody every 19 minutes, and, yet, something that could have real benefit for people, and we could not find evidence of deadly overdose from, could not even be studied. That just wasn’t right.</p>
<p>“I think the fact that there was data from other places around the world -- and there was certainly a lot of anecdotal data within the United States -- and the alternatives people were left with were opioids or even, frankly, the anti-seizure medications, which can also be very toxic, were so accepted and, yet, this was not even allowed to be studied. That didn’t sit well.”</p>
<p>Dr. Gupta sees a benefit to using medicinal marijuana for those patients caught up in the opioid epidemic. “Sometimes it’s a result of an injured nerve and that’s very hard pain to treat and opioids aren’t particularly good at treating that kind of pain. Not only do I think that medical marijuana can be helpful in reducing opioid dependence and aiding first time users, but I also think it can actually be helpful in treating a type of pain that opioids just aren’t that good at treating. It’s doing something that the existing ladder of treatments doesn’t do very well.”</p>
<p>Cannabis has the potential to be a game changer for opioid abusers, however, it will be up to leaders like Sanjay Gupta to get the message out into the world. He just has to figure out how to get people to open their minds. But it’s not like he doesn’t have firsthand experience with that.</p>
<p>“I think the idea of being synonymous with something is in a way being synonymous with the ability to, first, admit that I made a mistake in not digging deeper earlier and, also, synonymous with the idea that I am open-minded.”</p>

Blüm believes the distinctive selling point that separates its dispensary from others in the market is their patient-focused customer service with a guiding philosophy that the patient always comes first.

The first thing they’ll be asked is what they are looking for and Blüm’s knowledgeable budtenders will narrow down their best options based on cannabinoid and terpenoid profiles of the products carried in the dispensary. Blüm also offers one-on-one consultation when patients require more education about the dispensary’s products.

Blüm is in the process of forming a 501©3, non-profit organization called The Blüm Foundation. Blüm will donate a portion of its sales to this foundation. The Blüm Foundation will create a board where schools, teachers, or students can submit a funding request for academic need. For example, if a school needs new computers, a teacher needs supplies, or a student is looking for a scholarship for an academic trip, the charity’s board will disperse funds accordingly. In addition to the newly formed Foundation, Blüm offers a 20 percent discount to veterans as well as gives substantial discounts to patients in critical care on a case-by- case basis.

		<title>DIVINING CANNABIS’ FUTURE</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>elevate NV asked industry insiders to look into their crystal balls and forecast what they thought the next year would bring to the cannabis space. Many of last year’s predictions were on target as quite a few of our prognosticators were confident Nevada voters would legalize adult-use marijuana. There were also a few optimistic advocates who predicted the DEA would reschedule cannabis and the industry would have some form of banking, but those hopes will have to be saved for another year. This year’s predictions mainly revolve around the timeline implementation of adult-use and potential for private cannabis clubs. We welcome your cannabis predictions too, so please share them with us at info@elevatenv.com.</p>

<p>"The most important development for Nevada's cannabis industry in 2017, and the total US cannabis industry, will be the ways in which President-elect Donald Trump's administration treats state-legal marijuana businesses. His nominee for Attorney General, Senator Jeff Sessions, is not a fan of medical or adult-use cannabis and believes that the existence of the industry and President Obama's 2013 Cole Memorandum sends the wrong message to American youth about the dangers of drugs. If Senator Jeff Sessions becomes Attorney General Jeff Sessions, it will be very very important that the Nevada cannabis industry, and marijuana businesses across the country, lobby the Trump administration to retain the current Department of Justice memos."</p>
<h4>--Andrew Livingston, Director of Economics and Research, Vicente Sederberg LLC</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p>“I am hoping that in 2017 the consumer starts to seek truth about cannabis and pursue knowledge and that the stigma of this plant not being medicinal is finally done away with. As this industry becomes more mainstream, some other not so great things I see happening is the involvement of Big Pharma and Big Agriculture. We have already started to see their involvement and it is worrisome. This is the biggest reason I hope the general public begins to understand that this plant is medicine and learn about their endocannabinoid system.”</p>
<h4>--Lance Parvin, co-founder and lead researcher, Compassion Awareness Project</h4>
<p>“As we all know, Las Vegas' drug of choice is alcohol. Mixing cannabis and alcohol does not lead to good things. Naive users, especially tourists who are not use to the potent cannabis available, may create an increase in drug related police calls and hospital visits. One death or serious accident, because of these naive users mixing alcohol and cannabis or misusing edibles, will cast a pall on the entire industry and provide fodder for critics of legalization. It is incumbent on public health officials and the industry to educate people on the risks associated with being intoxicated and then consuming marijuana.”</p>
<h4>Stephen McCamman, co-founder of the Clinical Endocannabinoid System Consortium</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>“The biggest surprise of 2017 will be that the cannabis industry, even with adult-use approved, is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s a challenging, high-risk business that requires significant capital, dedication and very hard work.”</p>
<h4>--John Ritter, advisory board member of TGIG, LLC</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p>“With the legalization of adult-use cannabis, I see tourism in Nevada being elevated to a whole other level.”</p>
<h4>--Jonathan Fine, President, Elevation Publishing</h4>
<p>“I predict Nevada will initiate an “early start” program allowing medical dispensaries to sell recreational marijuana pending the implementation of question 2, hopefully no later than June 1, 2017. I also predict Nevada will allow for public use of marijuana in social clubs, bars, nightclubs and concerts, becoming the first state to do so.”</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>--Nevada State Senator Tick Segerblom</h4>
<p>“Even though possession of one ounce of cannabis is now legal, there will be no way to legally purchase adult-use marijuana until dispensaries are licensed to operate. Therefore, we will see a surprising surge in black market sales, unless the current medical dispensaries are quickly licensed to sell recreational marijuana, as was accomplished in Oregon. Also, it may be a surprise to some because it feels like we are in the dark about how to develop and implement legalized marijuana programs, but Nevada will continue to be a leader in the country for its regulation and compliance.”</p>
<h4>--Riana Durrett, attorney and Executive Director of the Nevada Dispensary Association</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p>“Marijuana being available recreationally for adult use will be the most defining change in the overall cannabis industry in Nevada in 2017. With this new legislation, we also need to remain focused on maintaining a robust medical marijuana program in Nevada, which can be accomplished through lowering taxes for medical patients and reducing the time and cost necessary to obtain a medical patient card.”</p>
<h4>--Andrew Jolley, CEO of The+Source</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p>“Obviously, the most important thing that happens in 2017 will be adult-use marijuana. Two important variables stand out: when will we be able to sell and what happens to medical? My prediction is that because Nevada’s medical program has been executed successfully by the State and the licensees, adult-use will build on the current medical infrastructure at the State and local level and successfully launch in mid-2017. I also predict that rather than throw away the medical program or legislate it into obscurity, Nevada will use a combination of reform and tax rates to preserve the program for the benefit of patients in our State (at least I hope so!). Next year at this time, I hope we are six months into a temporary adult-use program, getting ready for a permanent one that looks very similar. I hope we have a vibrant and accessible medical program running alongside a similarly vibrant adult-use business.”</p>
<h4>--David Goldwater, Managing Partner, Inyo Fine Cannabis Dispensary</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p>“I predict that the FDA will finally acknowledge the medical benefits of cannabis and remove cannabis from the Schedule I classification.”</p>
<h4>--Liz McDuffie, director, Medical Caregivers Institute</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p>“Since the DEA did not reschedule marijuana this summer, I believe the next best thing, given the circumstances, would be passage of the Medical Marijuana Research Act of 2016. If this passes, there will be a huge number of research projects and hopefully the tide would change and DEA would have the research necessary to reschedule marijuana. As for Nevada, there will be development of standardized testing for marijuana impairment similar to blood alcohol concentration. Almost every one of my patients asks what would happen if they use marijuana and get tested a couple of days later during a moving violation. The development of a standard correlation between body fluid concentration of marijuana and level of impairment is necessary.”</p>
<h4>--Dr. Pouya Mohajer, founder, Nevada Medical Cannabis Association</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p>“2017 is going to see the establishment of Las Vegas as a global brand leader in the legal cannabis industry on a worldwide basis. We will see the launch of brands in Las Vegas -- realizing that Las Vegas gives exposure to 45 million tourists a year from an international audience -- showing how other cities can do it right. In 2017:</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-left:50px">Las Vegas surpasses all other legal cannabis destinations for travel searches and cannabis tourism.</li>
<li style="margin-left:50px">Las Vegas establishes private cannabis clubs for both tourists and residents to be able to come to and be social and entertained in a high-end atmosphere.</li>
<li style="margin-left:50px">Las Vegas becomes the global brand commercial center for the entire legal cannabis industry. If you do not launch your new product in Vegas, it may as well happen in a cave.</li>
<li style="margin-left:50px">Las Vegas will be the brand ambassador of adult-use cannabis to see how it can be regulated properly."</li>
</ul>
<h4>--Leslie Bocskor, Founding Chairman, Nevada Cannabis Association</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>“I believe 2017 will be a big year for cannabis in Nevada. There will probably be some improvements to the medical laws during the spring legislative session. The first legal sales to adults over 21 years old will probably be sometime around July. The state will want to start collecting taxes on sales as quickly as possible, so they have incentive to get it going quickly. I believe the Department of Taxation will want to rely on the regulatory infrastructure created by the Department of Public and Behavioral Health as much as possible.”</p>
<h4>--Ben Sillitoe, Oasis medical marijuana dispensary co-founder and CEO</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p>“Au! It is adult-use, not exactly gold yet. The industry, of course, wants to see the adult-use side implemented as early as possible. One of the significant reasons is to curtail the possibility for the black market to move in and profit from the “loop-hole gap” before an adult-use program is implemented. We are all working together and hope the regulatory entity will mirror-image the existing medical marijuana program as they “bridge” the adult-use program and allow MMEs to apply and operate in the adult-use market. Independent laboratory testing will catch more attention than before because product liability will become one of the focal points in both medical and adult-use markets. Public education will have to be emphasized by both sides of the industry. The industry will work with patients to dispense correct and powerful information.”</p>
<h4>--Dr. ChaoHsiung Tung, Laboratory Scientific Director for G3 Labs</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p>“I predict in 2017 Nevada's legislature will be forced to address many issues relating to cannabis legalization, including patients’ right to grow, public consumption and cannabis DUI laws.”</p>
<h4>--Amanda N. Connor, attorney, Connor &amp; Connor</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p>“The key will be getting in the trenches and making the eight states that have recently approved some form of marijuana legalization and the other states that have preceded them into a success. There are other goals that I have: I want the marijuana industry by the end of 2017 to be paying fair taxes with a check, but the most important thing in the short and the intermediate term is to make the implementation of the successful state ballot measures work as well as possible. The most powerful advertisement for further fundamental reform is getting what we already have right.”</p>
<h4>--Congressman Earl Blumenauer, 3rd District of Oregon</h4>
<h4> </h4>
<p>“I predict adult-use will be implemented in July and by September there will be a massive shortage of cannabis, specifically top shelf. The most surprising thing that will happen in the Nevada market is that even though the industry knows adult-use is coming, we will not initially be able to keep up with demand. I also predict that the Blue Man Group and Carrot Top will collaborate and introduce a proprietary cannabis strain called Blue Carrot.”</p>
<h4>--Scott Dunseath, VP Marketing, Kynd</h4>

<p>“Las Vegas will have its first real 420 party on the Strip as a precursor to having the largest 420 party in the world in the near future. Las Vegas will become the new Amsterdam as marijuana tourists come to Las Vegas for the food, shows, and lights. Las Vegas will have party buses that will drive up and down the Strip, in which tourists can smoke. Las Vegas will be the place where America goes to party.”</p>
<h4> </h4>
<h4>--John Laub, President, Las Vegas Medical Marijuana Association</h4>
<p>“Merging cannabis consumption with more socially common events is on the horizon. I'm hearing of cannabis-inspired dinner parties where dishes infused with cannabis are served and all are able to enjoy while connecting on completely new levels. There's Canna Yoga, where the lovers of breathing, meditation, and disciplined poses are now communing with others to sample cannabis before, during, and after class. It's only a matter of time before the Smith Center is hosting cannabis-inspired classical concerts or popular art galleries are hosting shows where patrons experience and discuss art. I, myself, cannot wait to discuss Julius Caesar while "elevated."”</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>‘PATIENTS HELPING PATIENTS’ PROGRAM INTRODUCED TO HELP LOCAL CANCER PATIENTS</h4>
<p>ShowGrow Las Vegas, Sun Valley Certification Clinic and <em>elevate NV</em> have joined forces to form a program called ‘Patients Helping Patients’ to aid local cancer patients. The free program will assist 10 cancer patients each month in getting their medical marijuana card, which can be a costly endeavor.</p>
<p>To raise the necessary funds, 100 percent of all house pre-roll sales at ShowGrow will go to the ‘Patients Helping Patients’ program and Sun Valley Certification Clinic will donate doctor’s recommendations. “Sun Valley will consult with the patient and provide them with a free doctor’s recommendation and then the money we generate at ShowGrow will go to pay for the state filing fee of $100,” explained ShowGrow Manager James Hammer of the program which began in December. “For every $100 raised a patient will receive their card. Our goal is to do 10 a month to start with and hopefully we can expand in the future to create more cards for the patients.”</p>
<p>Hammer’s idea for ‘Patients Helping Patients’ was inspired by his family’s support of charitable causes. “Both my parents were involved fairly heavily in philanthropy for cancer, they raised somewhere near $70 million for the Nevada Cancer Institute when that was built. That’s always been something we have tried to help promote within our family,” said Hammer. “Because cancer patients are probably one of the top three types of people who really need medical cannabis, in addition to going through one of the biggest hardships in terms of financial costs, we are trying to mitigate anything we can for them to help ease their pain and find relief through cannabis.”</p>
<p>If you know someone with cancer who is in need of a Nevada medical marijuana patient card, please contact ShowGrow about the ‘Patients Helping Patients’ program at 702.227.0511.</p>

		<title>WILL NEVADA FOLLOW OREGON’S LEAD IN ADOPTING AN EARLY START PROGRAM?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Riana Durrett</h4>
<p>Senator Tick Segerblom recently embarked on a legislative fact-finding mission to meet with Oregon legislators and regulators to discuss the state’s “Early Start” program. Senator Segerblom has expressed an interest in allowing legal sales of adult-use marijuana prior to the time Initiative Petition 1 (a.k.a. Question Two) would allow adults to legally purchase marijuana in a dispensary. Passage of IP1 allows for possession of one ounce of marijuana as of January 1, 2017, but legal sales may not occur until much later.</p>

<p>Senator Segerblom recently invited Nevada legislators and stakeholders to join him in a roundtable discussion with the Oregon Liquor Licensing Commission, Oregon Health Authority, Oregon state representatives and others to gather information on the benefits and challenges that may accompany an “Early Start” program in Nevada. Senator Segerblom was joined by four Nevada legislators, medical marijuana establishment owners, Nevada tribal members, Nevada Dispensary Association members and its Executive Director Riana Durrett, Legislative Counsel Bureau staff, and others.</p>

<p>The Nevada State Legislature will convene in February and, in turn, has the opportunity to put regulations in place that would allow legal marijuana sales to possibly occur earlier than required by Initiative Petition 1 (IP1).</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Q: When can dispensaries legally sell marijuana in Nevada?</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>A: The Nevada Department of Taxation (NDOT) is required, under Initiative Petition 1 (IP1) to adopt permanent regulations by January 1, 2018 and to start accepting applications by that date. NDOT is required to accept or reject those applications within 90 days of receipt. Therefore, facilities shall be licensed by spring 2018, but NDOT is not required to allow the facilities to actually start sales by that deadline. Senator Segerblom would like for Nevada’s residents and tourists to be able to access retail marijuana much sooner. When retail marijuana was legalized in Oregon through ballot measure 91, as it was in Nevada through Question Two, the Oregon Legislature decided that retail marijuana should be available for purchase as soon as the Legislature could pass a measure allowing retail sales and adopt rules regulating those sales. Senator Segerblom has expressed his intent to submit a Bill Draft Request (BDR) to allow the retail sale of marijuana in a timeframe that allows for sales to occur as early as this summer.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Q: Can Nevada follow Oregon’s lead in allowing retail sales sooner than contemplated under Question Two?</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>A: Senator Segerblom organized the recent fact-finding trip to analyze Oregon’s approach to allowing retail sales that took place before their ballot measure was regulated. “Just like in Oregon, an Early Start program is a viable option in Nevada. It would actually be easier to implement than it was in Oregon because we have such a robust regulatory system for our existing medical marijuana industry,” remarked Senator Segerblom after meeting with the Oregon LiquorLicensing Commission. “We literally could flip a switch and sell and track recreational sales through our medical dispensaries tomorrow.”</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Q: How did Oregon allow retail sales earlier than its ballot initiative contemplated?</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>A: Oregon voters passed Measure 91, which legalized recreational marijuana possession as of November 2014, which became effective on July 1, 2015. However, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) would not start accepting applications to operate recreational marijuana establishments until January 2016 and the businesses would not be licensed to operate until fall of 2016. The Oregon Legislature found that public safety was at risk because the delay between legalization of marijuana and operation of state-licensed establishments would encourage black market sales. In 2015, the Oregon Legislature passed SB 460, which allowed dispensaries to sell limited amounts of marijuana flower to any person over the age of 21. The Oregon Health Authority (OHA), which regulates the medical marijuana industry, was required to adopt rules that would allow for the sales to commence October 1, 2015. In 2016, the Oregon Legislature expanded the Early Start program to allow for limited sales of edibles, concentrates, and infused products.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Q: Would Nevada still collect the taxes required under Question Two?</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>A: The tax rate for “Early Start” sales in Oregon is higher than the “commercial program” adopted under Measure 91. Sales under “Early Start” are taxed at 25 percent while recreational sales under the “commercial program” will be taxed at 17 percent. The Division of Revenue was tasked with collection of the taxes accrued in Oregon’s Early Start program. Oregon collected over $54 million in the first 10 months the program operated. If Nevada adopted a similar program, than the State would be able to capture tax revenue even earlier than is contemplated under IP1 and there are likely to be higher sales in Nevada than Oregon, given Nevada’s thriving tourism industry. If Nevada does follow Oregon’s lead in early adoption of retail sales, Nevadans and Nevada’s tourists could purchase retail marijuana legally sooner than contemplated under Question Two, but the change will still not be immediate. Nevada’s legalized marijuana industry, patients, and tourists will need to stay tuned for more information on dates and information on what is allowed under Nevada’s Early Start program, if it is adopted.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Q: How would Nevada benefit from early sales?</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>A: Benefits of an Early Start program include: An Early Start program would discourage the black market sales of marijuana that are likely to occur now that possession is legal as of January 1, 2017, but sales are not. The State can begin to collect the taxes that it will eventually be collecting from the sales of marijuana. Oregon collected $54 million in the first 10 months of its Early Start program. If Nevada doesn’t follow suit, it would most likely lose that amount in tax revenue, if not more. As Nevada’s legislators assemble to begin the 79th Legislative Session next month, those consumers interested in accessing adult-use marijuana should stay abreast to find out when they can begin making legal purchases.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For more than 40 years Congressman Earl Blumenauer has been supportive of ending marijuana prohibition, first voting in the Oregon legislature to decriminalize small quantities in 1973. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1996, Blumenauer has worked tirelessly for cannabis reform. In 2013, Blumenauer along with fellow Congressman Jared Polis co-authored a report “The Path Forward: Rethinking Federal Marijuana Policy,” which outlines several opportunities to reform and clarify marijuana law at the federal level.

You were an early believer in cannabis. Why were you so pro-cannabis?

<div class="panel-body">

We were in the midst of a reevaluation of our drug and alcohol policy which basically didn’t work very well. It wasn’t humane; it didn’t help people who had real problems. We were treating chronic, late stage alcoholics like criminals by locking them up in in jail when they were sick. It was part of an effort to see if we could treat people with mental illness more humanely and, frankly, part of the reappraisal of our drug and alcohol policies focused on cannabis. It was shocking for me the more that I got into the issue to realize that we were treating marijuana as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, which was actually far less addictive and deadly than tobacco. It made no sense to me then and certainly makes no sense to me now to criminalize the behavior of otherwise law-abiding adults.   
I felt very strongly about it. In fact, we had a vote at the same time to legalize adult use. It was the first state that there was a vote like that. It didn’t quite pass; although I was told by people who were more knowledgeable than I was that if the people who voted ‘no’ but smoked pot had voted with us it would have passed, and Oregon would have been the first state to legalize adult-use. I have long felt that it was important to treat this more rationally. Oregon was one of the first states to decriminalize medical marijuana and, over the years, I have had countless interactions with people who tell me how access to medical marijuana has changed their families’ lives for the better and it continues to be a critically important reform for me.

Having never smoked or consumed marijuana, why do you believe access to cannabis is so important? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

There are a number of things that I don’t personally use that I don’t think should be criminalized. I don’t smoke tobacco but I don’t want to lock people up who make that choice. I don’t think that’s where the heavy hand of the law ought to come down. I think people ought to have the discretion of things that are not harmful. I think the evidence is that marijuana for medicinal purposes or for adult-use has less serious consequences than other substances that are legal. That ought to be the right of individuals. 
I am a huge believer in medical marijuana, if I or a member of my family was suffering from a condition that would lend itself to treatment by medical marijuana, I would not hesitate for a moment to use it. If there was a baby in my family with an extreme seizure disorder, I would not hesitate for a second to be able to use the cannabinoid treatment that stops those violent seizures that torture the baby. I have had too much evidence, too many personal examples from people I know. It’s kind of interesting -- the states that have medical marijuana prescribe fewer pills. The opioid crisis is killing people, unlike marijuana. This is something that is very easy for me to get passionate about because it’s important, it’s the right of individuals. It’s also something that when we break the federal shackles on marijuana research and we have bipartisan legislation to do that, I think we are going to be pleasantly surprised by all the applications that we will develop to use marijuana medicinally.

With the recent tipping point that now allows for some form of legalized cannabis in 28 states, what do you think that portends for federal prohibition?     
</a></h4>

<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I think the elections in the fall of 2016 were the cresting of this wave. It has been building for some time, but now we won eight out of nine elections. Cannabis got more votes than Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. The Florida vote was overwhelming at over 70 percent but it also passed in Arkansas and North Dakota. This is not just a left coast, Oregon, Washington, California hippie new-age thing, this is a national phenomenon. I have been involved with these efforts from Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon. We now have 28 states with access to medical marijuana, but if you take the other states that have enacted legislation that deals with the infants with extreme seizure disorder that use a low THC high-CBD medicine, that’s another 10 states. 
I think this means that Congress is going to be even more favorably disposed. We have been making real progress in the recent session of Congress, we are getting votes on the floor of a Republican-controlled House, we are seeing action in the Senate for the first time and now with the issue cresting in all these other states, I think there is going to be even more energy, interest and progress in Congress.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Overnight the number of state legal cannabis businesses exploded. People may or may not agree with us that it is time to end the failed prohibition of marijuana -- although I will tell you that more and more people are taking that position, which is basically the position of 60 percent of the American public. But even those who are agnostic or even opposed are representing state-legal businesses that have a difficult time getting a bank account and can’t fully deduct their business expenses. Those aren’t partisan issues. I have been working in this area for years. I have never met anybody who, regardless of who they feel about legalization of cannabis, thinks there is any purpose served by forcing this industry to be conducted on an all-cash basis. It’s preposterous. It promotes theft, money laundering, tax evasion and it’s hard to grow a business without the simple expediency of a bank account and people understand that. People paying their state marijuana taxes with shopping bags full of $20 bills is outrageous and because they cannot fully deduct their business expenses, these otherwise perfectly legal, legitimate businesses are paying effective tax rates that are two, three or four times higher than similar businesses, it’s not fair. And this is an area of the economy that experts tell us will be bigger than the NFL in just a few years. It’s already over a $7-billion-dollar-a-year industry and is growing by leaps and bounds.

As a member of the Ways & Means Committee, do you foresee an opportunity to find a banking fix for cannabis? 
</a></h4>

<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Yes, I do. I think we have good bi-partisan legislation in both the House and Senate to make it possible for state-legal businesses to have access to bank accounts. Even within the existing framework, developments are also taking place to make it easier. In Oregon, for instance, we have a system to follow from seed to sale which might raise the confidence level of some financial institutions who actually want to provide services to this industry. But, regardless, I think there is an opportunity for us, as legislation starts moving, to find a vehicle to attach it. 
In Ways and Means, we have had legislation in the House and in the Senate Finance Committee. My partner is Ron Wyden on the Senate Finance Committee who is supporting legislation that would eliminate provision 280E, that prevents the full deduction of their business deductions. I think there will be tax legislation that will be moving between the two chambers. I think it’s not much of a stretch to imagine it being attached to one of the bills that’s moving.

With Senator Sessions as President-Elect Trump’s pick for Attorney General do you think the cannabis industry will stall?  
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

As I mentioned, cannabis got more votes than Donald Trump in every state when they were both on the ballot together. He has famously said that he thinks the state experiments should be allowed to continue and let the states do what they want to do. I think his instinct is right in that we will be working to try and encourage him to remember what he said and to respect it. Jeff Sessions would not have been my first, second or third choice for attorney general, and not just because he has said some pretty outrageous things about marijuana but the gentleman has other disqualifying issues.
The strength in Congress is growing and it would be an epic mistake for a new administration that already is taking office with the lowest approval ratings in history to all of a sudden reverse itself again from what he said during the campaign, and pick a fight with the American public and many of his supporters. I see nothing to be gained. In the long run he won’t win. And whatever short-term dustup there might be with Senator Sessions -- this train has left the station and history is going to deliver a victory for a rational marijuana policy and repeal the failed approach of prohibition.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I think what will make the most difference on Capitol Hill and with any administration is having these thoughtful, hardworking well-spoken business people continue to make their case on Capitol Hill and to be involved as they have been increasingly in their various home states. We have had hundreds and hundreds of very thoughtful people come and make their business case to the people in Congress. It’s critical that people continue it. I have watched their growing sophistication, their advocacy is stronger, they have trade associations, they hire lobbyists, they have been involved with political campaigns just like a real industry and it makes a difference.

</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

The days of the federal prohibition of marijuana -- scheduling it like a Schedule I controlled drug, unfair taxation – they’re numbered. Whether it is two years, four years, six years, those policies will be changed. I am willing to go on record stating unequivocally that within five years most of America will have access legally to medical marijuana and I think the states will be able to treat marijuana how they would like, just like with alcohol. Today, states technically could go back to prohibition of alcohol, they don’t, in part, because it doesn’t work and because of public opinion. I think within five years, that’s where we will be with marijuana.

Oregon implemented an Early Start program after adult-use had passed. Nevada is also considering an Early Start program. Would you recommend that? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I think being able to start sooner is better. The sooner you start to discourage the black market the better. Also, it takes time to just put the regulatory structure in place to get people to be involved with the different way of doing business. Enabling people to start earlier, slower, to acquaint the state regulators, the business and the public with the new approach I think makes sense. 
And I don’t think anybody will complain about a few million dollars more that’s available for treating people with substance abuse issues, helping mental health, education, law enforcement. Both Oregon and Nevada could use a little extra money for things that the public cares about. And I would much rather have this be paid legally to businesses that are operating under the law than have the profits disappear into the black market or worse to foreign drug cartels.

		<title>A 101 for Integrated Pest Management (IPM)</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is the careful consideration of all available pest control techniques and appropriate measures to discourage the development of pest populations and keep pesticides and other interventions to levels that are economically justified and reduce risks to human health and the environment.</p>
<p>In laymen&rsquo;s terms, Integrated Pest Management is about stopping problems before they happen. It is a proactive, holistic approach to pests, pesticides, and other factors. In this article about IPM, we interview Jordan Mello, master grower for <a href="http://ingoodhealthma.com/">In Good Health</a> located in Brockton, Massachusetts.</p>

<h3>Why use IPM?</h3>
<p>Growers are legally limited in the kind of pesticides they are allowed to use. Since the majority of pesticides are managed and controlled by the federal government, and cannabis is a Schedule 1 drug in the eyes of the federal government, there are very few pesticides that are allowed for use in cannabis. The pesticides that are allowed typically fall outside the domain of EPA-regulated pesticides. These pesticides are generally referred to as &ldquo;minimum-risk&rdquo; pesticides, or tolerance-exempt pesticides.</p>
<p>Because of these limitations, a more proactive approach to pest management is required to keep cannabis pest-free. That&rsquo;s where IPM comes in -- by actively monitoring plants and quickly responding to threats, growers can avoid situations where the EPA-restricted pesticides might be necessary.</p>

<h3>IPM Regimentation</h3>
<p>All employees who enter In Good Health&rsquo;s grow area must change out of their street clothes and into scrubs. They are also supplied with in-house shoes, gloves, and hairnets. To avoid contaminating separate rooms, employees are required to change their clothing, shoes, and other equipment when they enter a different grow room.</p>
<p>In addition to standard employee practices, Mello regularly inspects his plants for any sign of pests. He also inspects their water tanks, flushes, and other equipment to make sure that nothing is out of alignment.</p>
<p>When pests are found, they are immediately dealt with. Mello uses appropriate amounts of pesticide for the right pests. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>With thrips, Mello uses <a href="http://ss1.us/a/zmlkMfTL">spinosad</a> in combination with <a href="http://ss1.us/a/GdbSvO6J">Azagard</a>.</li>
<li>With spider mites, Mello uses <a href="http://ss1.us/a/g5FaWteR">Azamax</a>.</li>
<li>When Mello encounters powdery mildew, he uses a combination of <a href="http://ss1.us/a/1Hd15PWY">Procidic</a> and <a href="http://ss1.us/a/U3qs2FG5">ZeroTol</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>IPM in Massachusetts</h3>
<p>Massachusetts IPM law mandates the use of organic pesticides only. Synthetic pesticides are not allowed. This means that growers in Massachusetts must adhere to the <a href="http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdahome?navid=organic-agriculture">USDA standards for organic produce</a>. Massachusetts law also requires microbiological screens and heavy metal testing. This makes IPM more difficult, because the microbio screens hamper the ability of growers to use biopesticides, or beneficial bacteria and fungi.</p>
<p>As part of enforcing these rules, Massachusetts subjects all growers to two site visits per month. One is announced, but the other is random. The inspectors go through the entirety of the grow operation, inspect equipment and plants, ask for MSDS (material safety data sheets) and SOPs (standard operating procedures), and more.</p>

<h3>How to Integrate IPM into a Grow Operation</h3>
<p>Start with design. Jumping in headlong and expecting good results will not end well. If you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re doing, meet with expert consultants like <a href="http://urban-gro.com/">urban-gro</a>. Just be warned that you need to have a critical eye and pick your &ldquo;experts&rdquo; carefully.</p>
<p>From there it&rsquo;s a matter of going over every weakness point in your setup. How are pests getting in? Are there structural deficiencies? What are you doing to reduce bringing in outside pests? How do you clean and sterilize for pests that are already inside? Is your humidity just right? How about your cooling systems? What procedures should employees follow?</p>
<p>All these factors need to be considered, and then you can [re]design your facilities appropriately.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Mark S.A. Smith</h4>
<p>Adult-use cannabis is coming to Nevada and as we anticipate the Nevada Legislature acting quickly so as to begin collecting the willingly-paid tax revenue, you can begin to adjust your business plans to capitalize on the correction of a failed prohibition on cannabis.</p>

<h3>Continue Focusing on Medical Consumers</h3>
<p>While you may be tempted to rapidly shift focus to recreational users, keep in mind that we don&rsquo;t know how long the Legislature will take to issue retail licenses. Until then, work on growing your medical patient market.</p>
<p>Medical patients will most likely be more frequent buyers and more consistent customers as they seek relief and benefit from cannabis&rsquo; curative properties. They can be a dependable, consistent base on which to grow your recreational business. This means continuing education about terpenes for specific health outcomes, various dosing methods for differing social and medical situations, and helping those who have been resistant to using cannabis because of its legal status learn how to find relief and healing.</p>
<p>Develop brands that target middle-age consumers and seniors. While a hip granny will be down with smokin&rsquo; a bowl of OG Gold Kush, she may be more willing to share her experience with a reserved sounding brand and conventional consumption method. Sweet Slumber, Rhum Relief, or Appetizer might be more appealing, especially when provided as a small-dose edible or topical.</p>
<p>For many potential medical users, smoking isn&rsquo;t an option. They don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;smell like a stoner&rdquo; and they don&rsquo;t like the harshness, especially if they aren&rsquo;t tobacco smokers. Helping them understand alternative administration methods is the key to them embracing medical cannabis.</p>

<h3>Build on Medical for the Adult-Use Market</h3>
<p>What&rsquo;s the difference between weed and cannabis? <br /> Lab testing.</p>
<p>With Nevada&rsquo;s stringent requirements for lab analysis, we&rsquo;ve set the standard on what high-quality cannabis means. It translates into a predictable, pleasant experience instead of an unpredictable and potentially un-fun outcome. And with active ingredient labeling, a customer no longer needs to guess what the results will be: Am I going to have a great time or get couch locked?</p>
<p>You can create true branded experiences with your products by educating adult-use customers on the generally expected effects of terpenes, CBDs, and THC dosages. While each person&rsquo;s experience will vary, you can finally lead them in the right direction.</p>
<p>Sophisticated customers don&rsquo;t just want to get high, they want to enhance their social experiences. With the elimination of most of the unregulated growing practices, customers experience few deleterious aftereffects common to poorly grown product. After your customers have tried the high-quality growth that Nevada raises, they won&rsquo;t settle for other moldy, weedy product.</p>

<h3>The Cannabis Cocktail Lifestyle</h3>
<p>Many of your prospective customers want to use cannabis like they use alcohol to relax and enhance their social experiences. They&rsquo;d much rather enjoy a controlled dose of cannabis then do cheap shots. Even the very best cannabis is way less expensive than a typical Vegas bar tab -- and you&rsquo;ll feel so much better in the morning.</p>
<p>When you consider the drink selection at a cocktail bar, every bottle behind the bar contains ethanol, the alcohol that makes us feel good. The difference between the least expensive and most expensive drink is everything else that&rsquo;s in &mdash; or not in &mdash; the bottle that enhances the ethanol. That&rsquo;s why a glass of red wine makes you feel different then a shot of tequila, and a fine whiskey feels different from a shot of cheap vodka.</p>
<p>You may wish to draw parallels to the cocktails customers enjoy with the products you offer. Most <br /> cocktail drinkers know how much they can consume for the effect they want. With dosing information, in short order, your cannabis consumers can have the same predictable experience.</p>

		<title>What is VPD?</title>
		<link>https://elevatenv.com/what-is-vpd/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2017 21:42:51 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What is VPD?</strong><br /> Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD) is the difference, or deficit, between the vapor pressure of water in the air versus vapor pressure of water in the leaf of a plant. Thus, VPD is a means of measuring potential water stress within a plant. It is a more accurate measurement than relative humidity (RH) because it accounts for the relationship of temperature and humidity. RH and VPD are typically inversely related, such that a low RH will mean a high VPD. That high VPD value means that a plant will feel a strong pressure to transpire significantly more water.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I care about VPD?</strong></p>
<p>While VPD is not a direct measurement of water flow or water loss, it&rsquo;s an indicator of stress in the plant. The VPD value tells you how strongly a plant will feel the need to transpire.</p>
<p>You can use this to your advantage, because an increase in the transpiration rate will also increase how much water your plant is pulling through its roots. An increase in the water absorption also means nutrient uptake increases. Thus a high VPD (or low RH) will increase nutrient uptake.</p>
<p>Conversely, high VPD values will result in plants closing their stomata to prevent water loss. If you want your plants&rsquo; stomata wide open to increase CO2 absorption, you will want a low VPD value (or high RH).</p>
<p><strong>How can I use VPD?</strong></p>
<p>You can use VPD measurements for different stages of your plants&rsquo; lifecycles. In the cutting or seedling stage, a high RH or low VPD is ideal to reduce stress and ease the new plant into growing. You also don&rsquo;t want temperature variations. With cuttings, this is typically achieved by placing them into a plastic dome.</p>
<p>In the vegetative stage, you can have a lower RH/higher VPD, somewhere between 60-80 percent RH. Keeping the humidity relatively high, but increasing the temperature with some temperature swings increases the plant&rsquo;s metabolism and encourages growth.</p>
<p>In the bloom stage, you will want an even lower RH and higher VPD. This is in order to prevent pathogenesis and add just enough stress to give the plants some extra flavor. This will, of course, depend on the particular strain you&rsquo;re growing. At this stage, there will be larger temperature swings to trick the plant into thinking winter is coming.</p>
<p>During the entirety of the plants&rsquo; lifecycles, make sure to take notes about the VPD and photographs and any other documentation you can think pertinent. When you go back over these notes, you can track how well your plants respond to specific conditions.</p>
<p><strong>What do I need for VPD control?</strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll need a few key things:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
<li>A controller that can integrate information from multiple sensors and give meaningful values. Ideally, this controller can also actuate equipment to keep the environment close to ideal set points.</li>
<li>Sensors to accompany the controller, placed in a variety of locations around the canopy.</li>
<li>Good airflow equipment to reduce microenvironments. This means fans and other means of air circulation. Good thinning techniques will also help.</li>
<li>Humidifiers and dehumidifiers. These are necessary for maintaining proper humidity levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there&rsquo;s more than just that. It&rsquo;s also recommended that you have:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:40px">
<li>An HVAC unit capable of handling inputs from your controller.</li>
<li>CO2 injection to maximize the benefits of VPD control.</li>
<li>An automatic irrigation system that can take input from your controller.</li>
<li>Appropriate lighting for your grow operation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What steps should I take to get started?</strong></p>
<p>Make a small testing area that you can control. Ideally, use a grow tent as a testing room. In that room, test everything that you can think of. Push your plants as far as they can go, then dial it back a step. Find out what it takes to get the best product with the smallest amount of input. Then take what you learned from the test area and apply it on a larger scale.</p>
<p><strong>What should I be wary about?</strong></p>
<p>Pathogenesis, primarily. VPD control methods generally increase the humidity, so if you&rsquo;re not keeping your grow operation clean and sanitary, you can run into issues with fungus and other pests. You also want to avoid condensation and the damage that comes with it. Dripping water means your humidity is too high.</p>
<p>Also be wary that different strains will respond differently to the same conditions. Use your testing room to figure out those differences.</p>

<h2>MINNESOTA</h2>
In December, Dr. Ed Ehlinger, the Minnesota Commissioner of Health, announced the department will add post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a qualifying condition for medical cannabis. Patients who suffer from PTSD and have their doctor’s certification will be eligible to sign up for a medical cannabis card beginning August 2017. Dr. Ehlinger also announced that the department will expand the program by allowing medical cannabis topicals, including patches, lotions, creams, gels, and ointments. Last year, intractable pain was added to the Minnesota program. The program — one of the most limited in the nation — had suffered from a lack of patient participation due to few qualifying conditions.

<h2>COLORADO</h2>
In November, Denver voters approved a ballot initiative to allow social cannabis use in certain private businesses. Initiated Ordinance 300 (I-300) was too close to call on Election Day, but once all the ballots were counted, it ended up receiving 53.5 percent of the vote. Calling for the implementation of a four-year pilot program, I-300 would allow businesses, including bars, cafés, and even yoga studios, to seek city-issued permits to create “consumption areas.” For private establishments to be permitted by the city to allow adult cannabis consumption in designated areas, establishments will have received formal support from their officially recognized neighborhood organization or business-improvement district, and recipients will be required to follow a number of guidelines.

<h2>TEXAS</h2>
Representative Joe Moody (D-El Paso), former prosecutor and the current Vice Chairman of the Criminal Jurisprudence Committee, has filed a marijuana-related bill for the upcoming legislative session. Rep. Moody introduced HB 81, which would replace possible arrests and jail time with a civil fine for low-level possession of marijuana. The bill, which is co-sponsored by Rep. Jason Isaac (R-Dripping Springs), would make possession of one ounce or less of marijuana a non-criminal offense punishable by a fine of $250. Under current law, possession of two ounces or less is a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to a $2,000 fine and 180 days in jail. Senator Jose Rodríguez, also of El Paso, introduced a Senate companion bill, SB 170.

<h2>OHIO</h2>
Four Ohio communities passed local ordinances reducing penalties for marijuana possession to none. Adopting the new measures on Election Day, Ohio residents voted to remove all penalties for the possession of 200 grams or less of marijuana and marijuana paraphernalia with no jail time or fines under local ordinance. The towns of Bellaire, Logan, Newark, and Roseville each adopted similar ballot measures. The measures only affect violations in those jurisdictions, not the whole county. Similar efforts are already underway in Cleveland, Lorain and a handful of other communities.

<h2>NEW YORK</h2>
On Dec. 1, the New York Department of Health announced that it will add chronic pain as a qualifying condition for the state’s medical marijuana program. The Department will develop a proposed regulatory amendment, which will include language specifying the chronic pain conditions that would qualify for medical marijuana. Under current law, patients only qualify if their pain is caused by qualifying conditions. The other ten qualifying conditions are cancer, HIV infection or AIDS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, damage to the nervous tissue of the spinal cord with objective neurological indication of intractable spasticity, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, neuropathies, and Huntington's disease.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s asinine, absolutely asinine,&rdquo; observes Las Vegan Jed Snyder of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration&rsquo;s (DEA) December filing of a final rule notice to establish a Controlled Substances Code Number for CBD and hemp as a Schedule I drug. &ldquo;We need to research this. Schedule I says that there is no medical benefit -- well how do you know that? How do you know that unless you research it? You have to have the scientists and medical researchers research this and let them tell your office that it has no medical value. But it&rsquo;s like a catch-22, you can&rsquo;t make a statement like that unless you have the research and you don&rsquo;t have the research to make that statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snyder is very passionate about the DEA&rsquo;s recent filing because his 12-year-old son, Nicholas, takes hemp oil to control seizures resulting from Dravet Syndrome, which is a rare genetic epileptic encephalopathy.</p>
<p>Prior to taking hemp oil, Nicholas, who had his first seizure when he was four months old and was officially diagnosed with Dravet Syndrome when he was one-and-a-half years old, suffered on average one grand mal seizure per week. He started taking hemp oil <br /> in January 2015 and his seizures diminished dramatically. &ldquo;The first six months after he started the oil, we didn&rsquo;t change anything else, no other factors changed with Nicholas&rsquo; daily regimen and so we are confident in saying there was something in this oil that helped him to go from 45 seizures that he would have had in six months to two or three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jed Snyder and his wife found out about hemp and CBD oil during the summer of 2013 when they were watching Dr. Sanjay Gupta&rsquo;s CNN documentary about cannabis. &ldquo;We saw &ldquo;Weed&rdquo; and my wife and I were watching and looking at each other with our mouths open. And we were crying,&rdquo; explains Snyder. &ldquo;The next night I called Dr. Shackelford&rsquo;s office (a Colorado physician who Dr. Gupta consulted in &ldquo;Weed&rdquo;) and he came on the phone and gave me an hour. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. We had a great conversation and I explained about Nicholas and he said the best thing you can do is talk to your Congressmen and tell them your story. And that&rsquo;s before we even tried it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the fall of 2013 when the Snyders decided they wanted to try CBD oil, they weren&rsquo;t the only ones. After Dr. Gupta&rsquo;s documentary put a spotlight on Charlotte Figi, who also suffers from Dravet Syndrome, as well as the Stanley Brothers and their Charlotte&rsquo;s Web (CW) CBD oil (named for Figi), they were inundated with orders.</p>
<p>To meet the overwhelming demand for CBD oil, the Stanley Brothers started growing hemp to make an extract similar to the CBD oil they had created. &ldquo;They started producing hemp because they can grow more hemp faster and it reduced the long waiting list they had,&rdquo; explains Snyder who was on a waiting list for the oil until January 2015.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we started the oil, we had high hopes but we really didn&rsquo;t know what to expect,&rdquo; says Snyder of the CW Hemp whole-plant extract Nicholas takes that has a ratio of roughly 20/25:1 CBD to THC. &ldquo;Nicholas&rsquo; improvement has been amazing. He still has the seizures, but when he is not having them his quality of life is so much more improved. He is clear headed, he is more focused, he is more verbal, he sits, he listens better...his balance, his walking, his gait is much improved. There&rsquo;s that whole other part of him that is much improved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As far as Nicholas&rsquo; continued improvement, in a letter dated December 14th the Stanley Brothers assured their patient base that they will still be able to get their medicine in spite of the DEA&rsquo;s recent actions. &ldquo;They basically said the bottom line is to remain calm, your lives will not be disrupted by this ruling and that the ruling is not constitutional,&rdquo; Snyder conveys of the correspondence he received regarding Nicholas&rsquo; medicine. &ldquo;They also encouraged us to tell our Congressmen to make the DEA back off hemp by finally removing the legal barriers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snyder was a step ahead of that directive having heeded Dr. Shackelford&rsquo;s advice. He had already become an activist working with an organization called &lsquo;A Coalition for Access Now&rsquo; founded by Charlotte Figi&rsquo;s mother, Paige, which is working on getting federal bills, HR 1635 and companion SB 1333, passed, to reschedule CBD from Schedule 1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always kind of thought it was ironic that for decades the people who argued against any kind of legislation of cannabis were concerned about the children -- using the argument how can you have this available where children will have access? And, now, in recent years it&rsquo;s been one of the biggest impetuses for medical cannabis. Sick children have been the ones prompting the news and getting this out there.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>By Justin Alexander</h3>

<p>Chocoholics can rejoice, Nevada&rsquo;s dispensaries have more chocolate on hand than Willy Wonka&rsquo;s Chocolate Factory. Medical marijuana patients have truly won the golden ticket when it comes to medicating with the rich cocoa elixir that melts in your mouth.</p>
<p>Now that chocolate abounds, how much should you take? That seems to be the most common question for an edible user. The best answer? Always remember with edibles to start low and go slow. Chocolate produces a unique high -- it comes on gradually but is long-lasting so it is recommended to wait at least 45 minutes before increasing a dose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can vary depending on a patient's height, weight, metabolism, and tolerance to cannabis,&rdquo; Christie Strong of Kiva Confections explains of ingesting edibles. &ldquo;Edibles can last anywhere from four to eight hours depending on the dose&mdash;and even longer with higher THC amounts. We always recommend new patients start with 5 mg of THC to start and then wait two hours for the full effects before increasing their dose. Once a patient understands their tolerance, they can feel free to target the experience they want to have.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Incredibles</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by unique flavor combinations, Incredibles has a lineup of chocolate bars that includes everything from Salted Pistachio Mint to Dark Chocolate Roasted Habaneros &amp; Raspberries. Steven Chang, national sales director for Incredibles, says that with the creativity of chefs today in the cannabis industry, the sky's the limit on edible flavors.</p>
<p>Chang counts the Peanut Budda Buddha Bar as his personal favorite and offers a special recipe. &ldquo;Make a grilled-cheese sandwich, but sub the cheese for squares of PBB and add your choice of jam,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Chocolate bars are also great to use in other recipes that make it even more fun to eat cannabis. Plus, chocolate has a lot of other benefits that are good for you, such as lowering cholesterol levels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Incredibles confections are a superb delivery system for hash oil&mdash;and easy for the body to absorb and digest. &ldquo;The oil is a hybrid mix,&rdquo; Chang says. &ldquo;So much changes from harvest, extraction, decarboxylation, infusion and ingestion. That final oil is never going to be dominant sativa or indica, therefore you will always have a hybrid experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Kiva</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Our standards are incredibly high&mdash;if the taste doesn't make us want to dance, then it's back to the drawing board,&rdquo; explains Christie Strong, Kiva Confections marketing communications manager, of Kiva&rsquo;s chocolate bars.</p>
<p>With a motto of &ldquo;dedication to deliciousness,&rdquo; Kiva meets that high standard by acquiring beans from around the world, using 54 percent cacao semisweet for its dark chocolate and 34 percent for milk chocolate. Then, a cold-water hash process infuses the product with local cannabis, resulting in medicine that is ideal for a variety of ailments that includes insomnia, anxiety, pain, and appetite stimulation.</p>
<p>The key to any great cannabis confection, especially in a chocolate format, is cocoa butter that binds with THC to create a delicious earthy taste profile. Kiva uses an extremely thorough testing method on its hybrid-strain confections that includes analysis of the raw cannabis product used to infuse the chocolates and final quality control to make sure everything is consistent.</p>
<p><strong>Dixie</strong></p>
<p>There are a few really good reasons why Dixie&rsquo;s chocolate tastes so good. First are the ingredients. Dixie uses some of the most premium chocolate in the world, Callebaut chocolate from Belgium, which has a flavor so rich it masks the flavor of the THC oil. In addition, the cocoa butter bonds to the THC oil easily, preserving texture and taste so there is no need for unnatural flavoring. To achieve more interesting flavor profiles, Dixie also uses unique ingredients in their recipes such as Himalayan sea salt and pumpkin seeds.</p>
<p>But most importantly is the variety of ailments and conditions a square of Dixie chocolate can melt away. Preferred by those who don&rsquo;t smoke or are having a hard time chewing or swallowing, patients with asthma, COPD, certain types of cancers, or other ailments affecting their throat and lungs like Dixie&rsquo;s chocolate because it easily melts in their mouth such as the brand&rsquo;s Peppermint Dark Chocolate with 500 mg of THC -- a truly astounding product that maintains incredible taste with high potency.</p>
<p><strong>Kynd </strong></p>
<p>Kynd Cannabis Company has been collaborating with a northern Nevada chocolatier since last fall to create the first of its flagship chocolate bars. &ldquo;Our newly expanded product line begins with our dark chocolate and milk chocolate bars, but we will quickly develop into more chocolate crafted products through 2017,&rdquo; says Scott Dunseath, Kynd co-owner and vice president of marketing, of the brand&rsquo;s chocolate product line that launched in January.</p>
<p>With ten doses per bar available in potencies of indica, sativa and hybrid, Kynd&rsquo;s 37-gram bars actually taste like their names suggest -- a divine blend of real chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>Kabunky</strong></p>
<p>With a candy store size variety of offerings, Kabunky has a sweet tasting medible to suit every palate. Packed with authentic flavor that will please the most discerning chocolate lover, a bestseller with patients is Kabunky&rsquo;s Cookies &lsquo;n Cream Chocolate Bar. It tastes like a creamy crunchy scoop of its namesake ice cream. Patients can dig into this bite of dessert to relieve anxiety or pain.</p>
<p>Even better, Kabunky doesn&rsquo;t use chocolate just in its bars&mdash;they also make chews which are a soft and easy way to take your medicine. The texture and taste of the chews can most closely be described as similar to a Tootsie Roll. While chocolate is a kind of medicine all on its own, when infused with cannabis there are exponential benefits for both the mind and body.</p>
<p><strong>Evergreen Organix</strong></p>
<p>When you are in need of a brain boost or even a lift in your mood, break off a square of an Evergreen Organix chocolate bar, let it melt on your tongue, and you will soon be on your way to a higher plain. &ldquo;We start with high-grade chef&rsquo;s chocolate and infuse it with CO2 extracted cannabis oil,&rdquo; explains Jillian Nelson, operations manager for Evergreen Organix. &ldquo;Chocolate is difficult to infuse because it doesn&rsquo;t easily mix with cannabis oil, so the chocolate has to be mixed for several hours to make sure we are dosing evenly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evergreen&mdash;which doses bars at around 350 mg&mdash;has an array of chocolate bar varieties using strains of indica, sativa and hybrid flower. A standout is Evergreen&rsquo;s dark chocolate bar, which has a lovely, bittersweet, rich and smooth texture. &ldquo;Patients should consume based on their specific needs and usage history, but new users are best to start with less than one piece of chocolate since our bars are portioned into 24 break-off pieces,&rdquo; adds Nelson.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Healing Infusion</strong> Morgan Rebentisch and her husband infused their personal bath and body products with a marijuana extract to such &ldquo;amazing success&rdquo; that they started sharing their products with family and friends. &ldquo;We saw how much relief they were getting from them and wanted to share our products with our community,&rdquo; explained Rebentisch of how Infused was born. &ldquo;We developed our Infused CBD product line to provide individuals with the healing benefits of cannabis that could not or would not partake in the THC side of the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Made in Nevada, Infused is a THC-free non-psychoactive line of cannabis products offering powerful relief that includes pain relief cream and body lotion, oil, scrub, and butter. &ldquo;We use the highest quality cannabis extracts combined with certified organic ingredients at prices affordable on any budget,&rdquo; said Rebentisch. &ldquo;Our products are time tested and are free of toxins and harmful ingredients.&rdquo; <em>infusedmfg.com</em></p>

<p><strong>Covered in Kyndess </strong>Kynd Balm was developed as a result of a hole in the market. &ldquo;We saw a need in the market for a topical product that would offer the benefits of both THCA and CBD,&rdquo; explained Cara Pitchford of Kynd Cannabis Company. &ldquo;Our goal was to create something soothing and therapeutic that would provide relief for a long list of ailments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kynd Balm has a 2:1 CBD to THCA ratio. &ldquo;When you use our balm, you&rsquo;ll enjoy the full benefits of CBD and the non-psychoactive benefits of THCA,&rdquo; said Pitchford. &ldquo;Our balm soothes a wide range of skin, muscle and joint health issues. It also supports cell production, anti-inflammation and vasodilation for faster healing.&rdquo;  </p>
<p>Kynd&rsquo;s balm is created with CO2-extracted oil and a blend of essential oils. &ldquo;It brings relief to an amazingly broad range of ailments, making it a wonderful all-around ointment effective for muscle, joint and skin issues,&rdquo; explained Pitchford. <em>kynd.com</em></p>

<p><strong>Body and Mind</strong> Right out of the gate, BaM is taking a different route than the rest of the topical makers in the market. &ldquo;We infuse with both CBD and THC to set ourselves apart from all the hemp derived stuff we are seeing coming in from Colorado. We try to achieve a 1:1 ratio or equal amounts of both ingredients,&rdquo; explained BaM&rsquo;s head cultivator Don Decatur. &ldquo;Both CBD and THC have their own unique effects when using topicals so we like to have the combination of both to get a well-rounded effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Included in the BaM lineup of topicals is an Energy Coffee Bean Scrub, Pain Relief Spray, and Relax Lavender Lotion. &ldquo;We are trying to include a large amount per product and put at least 100 milligrams of THC and CBD in every product so that would be significantly more active ingredient than what is currently available,&rdquo; revealed Decatur.</p>
<p>For those concerned about THC showing up in drug tests, Decatur assures that won&rsquo;t be an issue. &ldquo;Topicals do not penetrate the bloodstream, so you won&rsquo;t get the psychoactive effect that&rsquo;s associated with THC. It&rsquo;s a nice way to get the effects without testing positive for THC.&rdquo; <em>bammarijuana.com</em></p>

<p><strong>Naturally Good </strong>Evergreen Organix eased into the topical market with just a bath bomb and lip balm but quickly found patients were using their lip balm everywhere but on their kissers. &ldquo;We got some really good feedback, such as people were actually using the lip balm on small areas of their body where they had eczema or psoriasis and it worked really well,&rdquo; explained Jillian Nelson, Evergreen Organix Operations Manager. &ldquo;We then expanded into doing the body cream and intimacy oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evergreen&rsquo;s intimacy oil took off much in the same vein as their lip balm. &ldquo;We originally developed that with the idea of putting it on very sensitive areas of the body,&rdquo; Nelson said of the oil which is made with only cannabis and fractionated coconut oil. &ldquo;But we found that women have even been using it to help with menstrual cramps by making their own cannabis-infused tampons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evergreen&rsquo;s full line of topical products, all made from natural ingredients, includes an Infused Massage Oil, Avocado Lemongrass Face and Body Cream, Lavender Mint Lip Balm, and THC/CBD Infused Botanix Bath Bomb. Evergreen&rsquo;s most recent product release is a Herbal Relief Salve that&rsquo;s a THC and CBD blend of essential oils, including menthol, camphor, and turmeric for people who are looking for something to help with arthritis or muscle pain.</p>
<p>Nelson, who notes Evergreen doesn&rsquo;t use petroleum jelly or paraffin wax products, said, &ldquo;Our dedication to using only natural ingredients is what makes us unique.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Roundtable Discussion</h3>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o6qGRhvAp9E" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The sleepy little town of Pahrump, Nevada, roughly 60 miles from Las Vegas, is well-known for many things, most not deserving of being mentioned here. Lesser known is that Pahrump is home to two burgeoning industries that have the potential to play a substantive role in diversifying the state&rsquo;s economic future.</p>
<p>Their status as relatively new industries in a tiny little sliver of the Silver State is just one of the things wine and cannabis have in common. Pahrump, with a population of approximately 37,000, is home to Pahrump Valley Winery (PVW), which has been quietly pressing and stomping its way to grapeness for 15 years under the direction of owners Bill and Gretchen Loken. The tiny Nye County town is also home to Green Life Productions (GLP), which, at roughly two years old, is a medical cannabis cultivation run by Steve Cantwell and Kouanin Villa, and is part of the state&rsquo;s newly unrolled cannabis industry.</p>
<p>Even though their facilities are a mere 2.4 miles apart, the two couples who run Pahrump Valley Winery and Green Life had never formally met until <em>elevate</em> brought them together for this story to discuss the similarities and differences between the wine and cannabis industries and their journeys as entrepreneurs.</p>

<p><strong>PIONEERING AN INDUSTRY</strong></p>
<p>The most obvious similarity the two entities share is being pioneers in industries that are both growing new roots in Nevada. PVW is one of only three wineries in the state, and the cannabis industry just began operation in 2015.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are just starting to explore cannabis while they already have a system that has pretty much been outlined by generations and generations of winemakers,&rdquo; said Steve, who manages cultivation at Green Life. &ldquo;So it&rsquo;s kind of cool to see an evolved industry that has matured and works through all the problems. They have already foreseen all the potential challenges and they have really got it narrowed down to what works and how to do it. We are still in a new industry, where we are still actively running into those walls and figuring out how to tear them down on the spot and rebuild them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Steve noted, winemakers have been around for generations but in Nevada&rsquo;s case it has been a more recent addition to the state&rsquo;s agriculture sector. &ldquo;The wine industry basically didn&rsquo;t exist in Nevada 13, 14, 15 years ago,&rdquo; explained Bill, who handles marketing and operations at the winery. &ldquo;Very few people really believed that you could actually develop a wine industry, a legitimate one, in the state of Nevada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of being in the beginning stages of an industry new to the state, it hasn&rsquo;t taken long for the Lokens and PVW to find success and accolades. To date, the winery produces on average 100,000 bottles of wine a year and has garnered 450 national wine awards.</p>
<p>Although surprised by their success, the Lokens were even more pleased with pulling off the impossible. &ldquo;That is the biggest satisfaction we get out of this -- is doing something that nobody believed could be done,&rdquo; explained Bill.</p>
<p>Bill believes that will be a motivating factor for Steve and Kouanin also. &ldquo;The industry that you are in is in its embryonic stages so you have an opportunity to really be on the cutting edge and be a leader in something that&rsquo;s not being done in Nevada and so I think you are going to find a lot of energy in that and I think that&rsquo;s going to sustain you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve concurred, but cited the difficulty of being on the ground floor of a new industry. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting but at times it can be nerve wracking. It can be overwhelming because we don&rsquo;t know whether to lead or follow at times. Your inclination is to look at the guy next to you to see what he is doing, but at the same time you want to do your own thing and don&rsquo;t want to get caught up with everybody else and their flow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although overwhelmed by pioneering a new industry, when Steve took the long view and looked 15 years down the road through Bill&rsquo;s eyes, he was encouraged. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting to be inspired by what others are doing. We heard their story for the first time today, of how they brought the wine industry to Nevada. They crossed barriers that people told them they couldn&rsquo;t cross and we have done a lot of the same things in our industry in these first two years as well. Implementing the growing system we have developed and using the technologies that we have used has allowed us to overcome those same barriers. It kind of gives me inspiration to hear about people who have successfully overcome those obstacles.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>WEED VERSUS WINE</strong></p>
<p>Prior to sitting down for this story, <em>elevate</em> arranged for both teams to tour one another&rsquo;s respective grow and vineyard. &ldquo;There were a surprising amount of parallels as far as both the growing side and production side that I really didn&rsquo;t perceive before,&rdquo; allowed Steve.</p>
<p>As PVW&rsquo;s winemaker, Gretchen, agreed, noting the many similarities especially as far as the sequence of the growing cycle. &ldquo;You start with the vegetative side then you move it to the reproductive side. Then it needs so much time before it&rsquo;s ready to actually harvest. It&rsquo;s harvested and then it needs to cure and then you actually have a product from it. Grapes are the same way, they go through all those different stages. So, to me, it was learning the cycle and finding out that the cannabis plant is very similar to the grapevine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although there are a lot of similarities between the two, there are also some slight variations in how each is grown. Bill offered a metaphor, &ldquo;it is a little bit like camping out versus living in a really nice luxury condo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In explanation, Bill continued, &ldquo;I would say that their process is much more scientific and they have much tighter control by handling everything inside. The incredible cutting edge farming that they use is really quite fascinating. So I see a very internalized, very controlled environment that&rsquo;s going through the same processes, if you will, whereas we are kind of old-school. We are out there in the elements using whatever soil the earth has given us today and dealing with the weather and other exterior elements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cutting edge growing style that Bill refers to is Steve&rsquo;s living soil method that he utilizes to nurture Green Life&rsquo;s cannabis. &ldquo;The way we grow is different from 99 out of a 100 facilities -- not just here in Nevada but throughout the industry in general. The cornerstone of our cultivation is really our living organic soil. We use no-till concepts and natural farming concepts to get it done. What this means is we don&rsquo;t feed our plants, we actually grow soil organically&hellip;rather than feeding the plant, we feed our soil and our soil, in turn, feeds the plant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am actually jealous that they get to camp out and I have to sleep in this condo,&rdquo; Steve replied, in answer to Bill&rsquo;s observation. &ldquo;What we are trying to do in the condo is replicate what they are doing outside -- just allowing nature to take its course. It&rsquo;s a beautiful process and they have their vast differences, but I think there are more similarities than there are differences. We are both making quality product and focusing on the needs of the plants and small details that make the big differences.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>THE TASTE OF TERPENES</strong></p>
<p>Terpenes is another similarity that is instrumental to the success of both cannabis and grapes. &ldquo;Terpene is a natural element in grapes. In certain grapes, depending on the wine, you want different levels of terpenes,&rdquo; explained Gretchen. &ldquo;For something like Sauvignon Blanc you want the terpenes -- that&rsquo;s what gives it that beautiful kind of grassy nose and that lemongrass aspect. But with Cabernet Sauvignon you don&rsquo;t want that high level of terpenes. You want to make sure the grapes are ripe so that it minimizes that. So we work with them pretty much the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With regard to cannabis, in addition to taste and smell, terpenes also take on a medicinal role. &ldquo;The first thing people want to do when they open a jar of cannabis is to smell it. The smell and the taste are two of the biggest factors in cannabis as I imagine they are in certain wines,&rdquo; observed Steve. &ldquo;We take it a step further and look at the individual medicinal effects to see what each terpene can help with. We try to use some of the science and research out there and really try to have a broad spectrum of terpenes to help a broad spectrum of illnesses. Pinene, for instance, is a bronchodilator or it helps people focus more. Another terpene, myrcene, is more for people to relax, it&rsquo;s more of a sedative, and it also helps the cannabinoids break the blood-brain barrier so you can feel the effects faster.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>SEEDS &amp; WEED VS. VINES &amp; WINE</strong></p>
<p>Cannabis is grown from seeds, whereas in the vineyard they begin with vines. &ldquo;We have to buy our vines from a certified nursery in California,&rdquo; offered Gretchen. &ldquo;You buy a grafted vine, you never deal with seeds when you are growing grapevines. The vines have already been grafted at least a year and then you bring them in and plant them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vintners have much more leeway as far as jurisdiction with regard to where they can get their product from compared to cannabis farmers. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t bring in seeds from out of state. Under state regulation we have to get them from within Nevada&rsquo;s borders,&rdquo; explained Steve of cannabis. &ldquo;They basically have to be donated from a legal patient. It really is a gray area because there really is no indigenous marijuana in Nevada so, at some point, all the seeds have crossed state lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other thing we can do, which wouldn&rsquo;t work for cannabis since you can&rsquo;t cross state lines,&rdquo; Gretchen added with regard to sourcing, &ldquo;is if we wanted to add a new wine, we can just buy those grapes from a grower in another state. We could just bring in the grapes and have a whole new wine. So we have got much more freedom in how we can expand than the cannabis industry does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In fact buying grapes from California growers was initially the way PVW used to make all of their wine. Then in the early aughts the Lokens decided to try their hand at planting vines and growing their own grapes in Nevada&rsquo;s soil. Following their first harvest in 2005, PVW sold Nevada&rsquo;s first commercial estate red wine, Nevada Ridge, in 2008. They now grow Syrah and Zinfandel grapes on two acres of the winery&rsquo;s grounds. The Lokens also source grapes for their wine from farmers in Nevada&rsquo;s Armargosa Valley, Fish Lake Valley, and Crystal Heights.</p>
<p>After finding success making wine from grapes grown in Nevada and realizing it could be done, Bill decided to start working with Nevada&rsquo;s alfalfa farmers to teach them about growing grapes. &ldquo;The economic benefit for grape growers is much higher than the alfalfa and it uses 15 percent of the water that alfalfa does. So they make more money, use less water, and can help grow the wine industry in Nevada,&rdquo; explained Bill.</p>
<p>Steve, too, has been working with area farmers to broaden the cannabis industry. &ldquo;We have actually spoken to several alfalfa farmers about growing hemp. We have also talked to other cultivators in other jurisdictions as far as cultivating methods using our organic system and replacing their hydroponic system. We are trying to do everything we can to spread the good news both on the cannabis front and the organic soil front. We are just really passionate about what we are doing, we believe in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>NATURALLY GROWN PARTNERS</strong></p>
<p>In addition to helping others, the two Pahrump neighbors have been helping one another. Steve has been using pumice from the winery to make compost for the cultivation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the biggest parts of our living soil system is our compost and there are only a few really good compost companies out there that make compost to my standards. We don&rsquo;t want to use bottled nutrients from hydroponic stores in our soil or compost, we want to make as much of it as possible on site. So we gathered their pumice which is basically all their pressings, stems, skins, and seeds,&rdquo; explained Steve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a specific recipe with carbon nitrogen levels that we are trying to reach. We have to get everything tested prior to the third-party composting process. So prior to actually putting it in a pile we have to have the pumice tested just to make sure there are no pesticides or fungicides. So kudos to them that everything came back clean,&rdquo; Steve said with an approving nod to the Lokens, &ldquo;if it was cannabis, it would have passed state regulations. So, yes, we threw that in our compost pile. That was more of our fruit component to add some more sweet taste and potassium versus just nitrogen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a partnership already somewhat in bloom, <em>elevate</em> wondered if the two entrepreneurs would consider working with one another to create a canna-wine or tincture. &ldquo;I would absolutely be inclined,&rdquo; Bill enthusiastically responded. &ldquo;The regulations are going to have to change a lot before we are able to do that on a consumer level because right now it&rsquo;s very tight, it&rsquo;s got to be medicinal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steve agreed, &ldquo;I think that would be excellent. I can see lots of ways that both sides can enjoy sharing their knowledge and product. I would love to possibly grow some organic soil grapes and see if we can also bring those grape profiles up and potentially make a sweeter profile. I would be interested in getting a plot of grapes going here soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill added, &ldquo;Not only would I be very open to it, but I would be tickled at the idea of doing it at the very moment that it is legal because it would be not only cutting edge, but it would be another Nevada product. We love this whole idea about growing Nevada. They,&rdquo; he concluded with chuckle and a nod to Steve and Kouanin, &ldquo;are literally growing Nevada, too, but it has taken on a whole new dimension now.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Richard S. Gubbe</h4>
<p>Grandmothers of old promoted natural healing remedies and used them without knowing what the actual content was or how they worked. Grandma said plants and trees produced a cure for almost any ailment, and out of faith we believed. Much of what granny said would work actually does and we are finally getting proof by identifying each of the compounds involved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ask 100 educated people what a terpene is and you may find one or two who knows they are part of our daily lives and have been since the first plant popped up. Enter any cannabis dispensary, take a big whiff and you will smell everything from pine to citrus. Ingesting the terpenes found in cannabis plants can ease the most challenging of conditions ranging from seizures to PTSD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t much research available about what this natural collection of molecules does for the human body. We know strains of cannabis have different organic compound mixtures of terpenes and cannabinoids that attach to receptors in the body, particularly in the brain, and can be healing. But lesser known are delivery methods, dosages, and mixtures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compare finding your ideal strain to the business of taking pharmaceuticals where a doctor tells you what you need, how much, and the delivery method. The doctor makes a calculated, educated guess as to what may help you and how much to give you. For medical cannabis, that is now the role of the dispensary worker to know. But buyer beware, the information can vary. And yet, patients can now make an educated guess on their own as to what is needed to reduce or relieve symptoms with a little bit of research.</p>
<p><strong>The Botany of it All</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The discovery of terpenes and their interaction with cannabinoids has created a new science that is in need of exploring. Terpenes, advocates say, create a synergy of effects that have healing results. The cannabinoid THC has long been known to help with pain and anxiety relief to name a few, but how it interacts with other cannabinoids and terpenes when received by receptors in the body is the key to better servicing patients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think of the synergy as if you are making an angel food cake. If you leave out the vanilla, does it change the taste, the outcome? Absolutely. But we won&rsquo;t die from a change in the recipe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Approximately 200 terpenes have been found in cannabis. Among them are monoterpenes, diterpenes and sesquiterpenes, which are characterized by the number of repeating units of a 5-carbon molecule called isoprene, the structural hallmark of all terpenoid compounds. Terpenes, or isoprenoids, provide cannabis with its inviting aroma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terpenes deter insect predation, protect plants from environmental stresses, and act as building blocks for more complex molecules such as cannabinoids. Many terpenes act synergistically with one another, and some either catalyze or inhibit formation of different compounds within a plant. Understanding how terpenes function can allow scientists and doctors to manipulate cannabinoids to desired ratios.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terpenoids and cannabinoids are said to increase blood flow, enhance cortical activity, and kill respiratory infections, including MRSA. They can also prevent fungus or act as an antibiotic. Terpenes and CBD can also buffer THC&rsquo;s tricky psycho-activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terpenes are active aromatic molecules that evaporate easily. Various researchers have emphasized the pharmacological importance of terpenes, or terpenoids, which form the basis of aromatherapy, a popular holistic healing modality.</p>

<p><strong>What Grandma Didn&rsquo;t Know</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marijuana&rsquo;s compelling fragrance and particular psychoactive flavor are born from predominate terpenes in a strain. Terpenes work the same as cannabinoids by attaching to cannabinoid receptors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delivery of terpenes in tinctures, oils and concentrates is where the debate begins as to which is better for the patient. Smoking it, purists claim, is the best form of unleashing these healing compounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most cannabis varieties have been bred and crossbred to contain high levels of THC while other cannabinoids like CBD become miniscule. Different harvests may demonstrate different terpenoid profiles due to variances in growing and curing techniques. Lab testing is the only way of knowing a strain&rsquo;s terpene potency. Matching the terpene profile and cannabinoid profiles to fit a patient&rsquo;s needs is the best way to achieve the synergistic effects desired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bad news is they dissipate, just like a room deodorizer. The challenge is to keep the bud fresh or, when extracting terpenes from the bud, to capture them quickly, keep them cool and turn them into a concentrate or mix them in a cartridge or syringe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Now that&rsquo;s a Nice Profile</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matthew Gardiner, the VP at Shango, beams when giving tours of his vertical facility on Boulder Highway. As a corporation, Shango has experience in Oregon and Washington and created a grow house in Las Vegas of at least 3,000 plants that cycle through the curing process to the bud packaging or extraction rooms. Each room is full of busy, gowned employees who take cannabis from the cultivation through production to the dispensary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gardiner says extracting terpenes quickly is crucial, as he holds up a vial of a golden mixture made from a Shango strain. The staff also mixes terpenes with CBD and THC to create vaping cartridges while every day gaining more knowledge of their interaction, notes Gardiner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shango and other growers are learning how to enhance terpene content by altering grow techniques that include stressing the plant or using different food. When you ask Gardiner or any other grower about data, the response is generally: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s proprietary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing not present at Shango is a testing lab. Labs are primarily regulatory, but they also are gold mines for data collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darryl Johnson is the scientific director of Ace Analytical Laboratory in Las Vegas and has a Ph.D. in bioanalytical chemistry from the University of Georgia. As a former Research Chemist Fellow at Atlanta&rsquo;s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the author of eight peer-reviewed scientific journal articles, he&rsquo;s far more than a lab tech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Testing the profile is Johnson&rsquo;s way to assure Nevada patients that they only get the good stuff, the clean stuff. As far as data goes, Nevada, with its stringent testing regulations, is at the forefront of research.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just scratching the surface,&rdquo; Johnson says. &ldquo;But we have more data than anyone else has ever compiled. A year from now we&rsquo;re going to laugh at how much we learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no typical terpene profile. For instance, in one batch, the strain Tropicanna had a state-tested percentage of more than 10 milligrams per gram of myrcene as well as generous amounts of limonene and pinene and a lot of THC. Anything more than two to four percent of a terpene in a profile is a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The profile comes in samplings taken from the bud. For concentrates, the profile contains everything in the oil. Concentrates and cartridges can now boast 75 to 90 percent THC with small amounts of terpenes and other cannabinoids. Concentrates come directly from the extraction of the plant of one strain. For the Tropicanna bud sample, the THC level tested above 26 percent with a low CBD count. Small amounts of terpenes and CBD can dip as low as .01 or lower.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Those miniscule amounts may have more of an impact than you know,&rdquo; says Johnson, who believes that as much as 75 percent of terpenes can be lost after the plant is cut down. &ldquo;Rosin press preserves terpenes pretty well,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;but the concentrates are missing something. I prefer the flower. I&rsquo;ll always prefer flower.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hugo Alonso, a chemist at New Heights Laboratory, says different testing results can come from testing different parts of the bud. &ldquo;Parts of the plant are even stronger than others,&rdquo; Alonso says. &ldquo;Concentrate would be more accurate to measure terpenes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He also believes terpenes are fleeting and he simplifies the process to &ldquo;just keep it cold, heat it fast, and cool it down again.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Just Like Grandma Used to Grow</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Jay Crozier was a little boy, his grandma gave him a marijuana tincture if he ever started to get sick. She was growing pot in the 1940s for medicinal purposes and taught him how to grow, and how to stay healthy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A 46-year-old, off-the-grid grower, Crozier remembers grandma telling him of a Native American Indica tincture in the 1930s made illegal in 1941. &ldquo;I never got sick,&rdquo; he says of using it. &ldquo;When I was young we used to get pepper bud out of Canada that smelled like black pepper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s spent his life learning how to grow cannabis to get the most out of it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m just into the medical aspect of it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I make sure the medicine is grown right, otherwise, you&rsquo;re not getting the full benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Growers can accomplish that by not cutting down plants early and curing them properly, he says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s taken me 30 years to know what I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been extracting since 1998 but never knew there were multiple substances involved. &ldquo;We knew terpenes added flavor but we thought they were part of THC because they were oily,&rdquo; he explains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crozier warns that synthetic terpenes are dangerous. &ldquo;They need to be banned,&rdquo; he relays. &ldquo;Freshly pressed rosin is solvent-free and just pressed from the flower. And live resin distillates -- they&rsquo;re great, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Making a Terpene Pie</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2011 the<em> British Journal of Pharmacology</em> discussed the wide-ranging therapeutic attributes of terpenoids, which are typically lacking in CBD-only products. The article reported that cannabinoid-terpenoid interactions &ldquo;could produce synergy with respect to treatment of pain, inflammation, depression, anxiety, addiction, epilepsy, cancer, fungal and bacterial infections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Bonni Goldstein puts that into practice combining terpenes with CBD. She is the medical director of Canna-Centers, a group of medical practices throughout California that educate patients on the use of cannabis therapy. The terpenoid called beta-caryophyllene has been shown to be anti-inflammatory and she uses that in combination with CBD to see what works in children to end epileptic seizures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I really believe that that&rsquo;s one of the compounds that is very important for a child who has seizures,&rdquo; she told Project CBD in California. She believes neuro-inflammation causes seizures and has had numerous success stories taking them away. One of her small clients went from 60 seizures a day to zero by using a CBD-terpene mix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Martin A. Lee of Project CBD believes the synergy of CBD and terpenes is a key to many afflictions he&rsquo;s seen Dr. Goldstein treat. Finding the right mix, he says, is like &ldquo;a painter with a palette. Profiles offer a kaleidoscope of shifting colors. Terpenes and cannabinoids are chemically related like cousins with medicinal affects. But receptor pathways are different in everyone. When you put it all together with this holistic entourage, the impact of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lee also believes myrcene is basically a sedative and follows the line of thinking that indica and sativa is not a valid measuring tool as each can have generous amounts of myrcene and other terpenes that alter the effects in every strain. He added that therapists can control the ratio of such when recommending a strain or method to their patients.</p>

<p><strong>The Future Is&hellip;</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shared research will mean more accurate profiles and, in turn, the ability for patients to find accurate recommendations for precise mixtures of terpenes and CBD. Delivery methods will need to be studied further as missing terpenes in profiles could create adverse or nonproductive situations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the future kiosks will adorn each dispensary to supply credible, uniform information and will tailor client profiles to preserve privacy. Dispensary workers will undergo continued training to better understand the science, delivery, and strains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Edibles will include the actual baking of cannabis itself to maintain the synergy of the plant through baking, much as it is now through vaping. Terpene bars and flavor testing rooms will inhabit dispensaries and enable more patients to utilize terpenes for healing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until then, budtender Sheldon Gates of Inyo Fine Cannabis dispensary sums it up simply: "the smell of terpenes is therapeutic and the plant energy itself makes people happy. We rarely see people who are bummed out. It&rsquo;s intoxicating to be around it. Our employees are on a natural high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looks like grandma was on to something.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are approximately 140 terpenes intermingling in cannabis strains that have attributes similar to aromatherapy. Here are the most popular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Myrcene</strong> (mer-seen) is the most prevalent terpene of all and is found in the most helpful varieties of cannabis, sometimes in high amounts, serving as a sedative or muscle relaxer.</p>
<p><em>Helps with:</em> sleeplessness, pain, inflammation, depression</p>
<p><em>Smells of:</em> earthy, clove or musky aroma with a splash of citrus</p>
<p><em>Also found in:</em> mango, thyme, lemongrass, and hops</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Limonene</strong> is often used in ointments and medicinal creams to help penetrate the skin more effectively. Found in strains with a pronounced energizing effect, Limonene can elevate mood and provide stress relief.</p>
<p><em>Treats:</em> anxiety, depression, gastrointestinal complications, heartburn, bronchitis</p>
<p><em>Acts as:</em> antifungal, antibacterial, anti-carcinogenic, appetite suppressant</p>
<p><em>Also found in:</em> fruit rinds, rosemary, juniper and peppermint</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Beta-Caryophyllene</strong> is the only terpene known to interact with the body's endocannabinoid system (CB2).</p>
<p><em>Treats: </em>arthritis, ulcers, autoimmune disorders, gastrointestinal complications</p>
<p><em>Acts as:</em> anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, gastro-protectant, analgesic</p>
<p><em>Also found in:</em> black pepper, cloves and cotton</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pinene </strong>is used as an antiseptic. Alpha-pinene and beta-pinene are common contributors to profiles that can help with alertness, memory retention, and counteracting some THC effects.</p>
<p><em>Helps with:</em> asthma, inflammation</p>
<p><em>Smells like:</em> pine trees and turpentine</p>
<p><em>Also found in:</em> pine needles, rosemary, basil, parsley, and dill</p>
<p><strong>Linalool</strong> has sedative properties that can offer relief from anxiety and stress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Helps with:</em> motor skills, inflammation, pain, seizures, depression</p>
<p><em>Smells of:</em> floral with spicy overtones</p>
<p><em>Also found in:</em> flowers, mint and cinnamon</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Humulene</strong> is known to suppress hunger and act as an appetite suppressant.</p>
<p><em>Acts as:</em> anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogen</p>
<p><em>Smells of:</em> earthy, woody aroma with a spicy scent or hoppy aroma</p>
<p><em>Also found in: </em>cloves, basil</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Borneol</strong>, most commonly used as a calming sedative, combats fatigue, stress and illness.</p>
<p><em>Acts as:</em> anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antiseptic, bronchodilator</p>
<p><em>Smells of:</em> earthy, camphor-like musk</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Joe Vargas has found an unusual niche in the cannabis industry. He discovered abuse of a prescription drug mixture known as lean, sizzrup or drank, that it&rsquo;s safe to say, he, alone, is creating a remedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we are doing is revolutionary, we are changing a culture that has involved millions upon millions of people and that&rsquo;s very powerful,&rdquo; says Vargas. &ldquo;We are making an impact by offering an alternative to these millennials who would otherwise be abusing their health, and killing themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That alternative is Cloud N9ne Hemp Syrup, a 60-milligram CBD and herbal concoction Vargas has developed as a healthy alternative to the deadly codeine-based &ldquo;lean&rdquo; cocktails made popular by the hip hop community and abused by the millennial set. The lean cocktail is a potent mix of prescription codeine and promethazine cough syrup, Spite, and, on occasion, a Jolly Rancher, used in combination to get in an altered state or &ldquo;high.&rdquo; With addictive qualities similar to opiates, this dangerous street drug has had some serious consequences even leading one manufacturer to stop making one of the cocktail&rsquo;s main ingredients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t realize how big the culture was until I started doing research,&rdquo; explains Vargas. &ldquo;Then around July or August of 2015 TMZ came out with a story that one of the biggest suppliers of lean or codeine, Actavis, was discontinuing its product for being too commercialized by artists like Justin Bieber, Rick Ross and other rappers singing about it. It&rsquo;s a cough syrup and not supposed to be something that&rsquo;s part of the party culture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A serial entrepreneur, Vargas started Cloud N9ne soon after seeing the TMZ segment. He transitioned from owning a nightlife promotions business to becoming a leader in the cannabis industry. &ldquo;I was in the nightlife/entertainment industry for quite some time and I was looking for an out of that industry. I didn&rsquo;t see my legacy as being someone who was running around nightclubs and helping people get drunk,&rdquo; reveals Vargas. &ldquo;I did my research and I saw a wave coming that probably not many other people saw coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Launching Cloud N9ne in 2015, Vargas created an atypical product for a demographic that is generally not medicinal cannabis users. &ldquo;The vast majority of our business comes from the millennial demographic that&rsquo;s 18-25. That&rsquo;s where we started and that&rsquo;s where we focus,&rdquo; says Vargas, who attributes his 1.2 million customers to word-of-mouth and a very strong social media reach.</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2015, Cloud N9ne has expanded its user profile. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s bled into the medicinal side and helps people who are looking for something to treat COPD, fibromyalgia, MS, pain or insomnia. Even people who have ADHD use it so they can focus at school,&rdquo; explains Vargas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vargas&rsquo; success with hemp syrup has led him to develop new product lines which can be found at buylegalmeds.com. His company will soon be launching CBD dabs as well as an 85 percent CBD oil that&rsquo;s made from both Charlotte&rsquo;s Web and AC/DC and has been registered with the Department of Agriculture. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s for people who want to use it for medicinal reasons to supplement other treatments or just want to use it for cooking or baking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the very unique niche he fills, Vargas says, &ldquo;I am a fan of doing things that other people are not doing. I feel like that&rsquo;s a little bit more valuable.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Mark S.A. Smith</h4>
<p>Selling retail cannabis is different -- very, very different. Treat it like a traditional retail product and you&rsquo;ll miss an amazing opportunity offered by every person who walks in your store. If you&rsquo;re staffing your cannabis dispensary with people from traditional retail stores, you&rsquo;re probably not getting the best sales performance from your team unless you have made the effort to do some sales behavior retraining.</p>
<p>Let me explain why selling cannabis is so much different. When you walk into a typical retail store and the clerk asks, &ldquo;May I help?&rdquo; your most likely response is, &ldquo;Just looking.&rdquo; They generally respond with, &ldquo;Okay, let me know.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not sales, that&rsquo;s a door greeter, like they have at Wal-Mart.</p>
<h4>Not Your Average Retail Experience</h4>
<p>Most retail salespeople behave like order takers, where the customer selects goods of their preference and makes a purchase. If customers have questions, it&rsquo;s about location of stock, not much more. The most challenging question the clerk asks, &ldquo;Is that cash or credit?&rdquo; Selling becomes pitching the store credit card, not the stocked merchandise.</p>
<p>Most retail stores carry mass produced, commodity products. Shoppers have a pre-established preference of a brand that fits their personal vision of themselves based on well-established, broad marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not the case for 95 percent or more of the visitors to a cannabis dispensary. They are there to figure out what they should buy because very few established cannabis brands currently drive consumer preference.</p>
<p>Even celebrity endorsed brands don&rsquo;t fully translate to a specific product experience, other than you get to party &ndash; in your mind &ndash; with the celeb. Do you really believe your favorite rapper is smoking $25 weed, even when it has their name on it? That&rsquo;s as likely as the Kardashians driving a Buick. Because of this market situation, your retail team&rsquo;s job is to figure out the customer&rsquo;s buying motivation and direct them to the products that best satisfy their desired experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Questions First, Product Second</h4>
<p>How can you turn the members of your retail team in to real salespeople? By using a simple assessment-based sales method that leads to a recommendation. Don&rsquo;t start by pitching a product because you&rsquo;ll confuse the average buyer. In cannabis sales, as in medicine, prescription before diagnosis is malpractice.</p>
<p>First, discover what experience the consumer wants and direct them to a selection of products that can deliver that experience. Then make two recommendations, one higher priced, and one lower priced. Then make sure they have all the accessories that they need to have a positive product experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Consider the following questions:</h4>
<p>Are you looking for something specific?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; -&gt; take them to that section of your store.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Just looking&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;We have so many products, it&rsquo;s almost overwhelming. What results are you looking for from this product? To relax? Focus? Pain relief? Party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you tried before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want more of that or something different?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;More&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;What do you like best about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &ldquo;Different&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;What do you want to experience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you want to consume it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you know what to choose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What else do you need to make your experience complete?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With just these simple questions, you can help your customer rapidly find what satisfies the experience they want. And once you start doing that, you&rsquo;ll enjoy both customer loyalty and a growing business.</p>

		<title>A PREVIEW OF BILL DRAFT  REQUESTS FOR UPCOMING  NEVADA LEGISLATIVE SESSION</title>
		<link>https://elevatenv.com/a-preview-of-bill-draft-requests-for-upcoming-nevada-legislative-session/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Riana Durrett</h4>

<p>As Nevada&rsquo;s 79th Legislative Session prepares to convene on February 6, a lot of new legislation will be under consideration by lawmakers for implementation. This article will offer readers a preview of marijuana-related legislative policy that the Nevada Legislative body will consider during this session.</p>
<p>But first let&rsquo;s review some background to better understand the parameters of Nevada&rsquo;s legislative landscape. There are five bodies of law (either all of a jurisdiction's laws or all of a jurisdiction's laws concerning a particular area of law) that will be relevant as marijuana laws continue to take shape.</p>

<p><strong>NEVADA&rsquo;S BODIES OF LAW</strong></p>
<ul style="margin-left:20px">
<li><strong>Nevada Constitution</strong>. This requires a medical marijuana program and registry and is unlikely to change anytime soon.</li>


<li><strong>Nevada State Laws (NRS)</strong>. There are currently at least eight Bill Draft Requests that aim to change NRS relating to marijuana and there will likely be others.</li>


<li><strong>Nevada Administrative Code (NAC)</strong>. The Department of Taxation will develop regulations surrounding the recreational use of marijuana and possibly medical use as well.</li>

<li><strong> Initiative Petition 1 (IP1)</strong>. IP1 governs certain aspects of Nevada&rsquo;s recreational marijuana program while leaving other aspects for the state legislature and state agencies to decide. IP1 cannot be amended or changed during the 2017 Legislative Session.</li>

<li><strong>Local Government</strong>. Each municipality imposes its own local codes, which carry the force of law.</li>
</ul>

<p>During the regular legislative session, which takes place from February 6 to June 6, 2017, the Legislature can only change NRS, but this could impact the other bodies of law mentioned above. Currently legislators, committees, state agencies and others are submitting their requests to change certain laws through Bill Draft Requests (BDRs) and legislative staff is writing the requested bills.</p>

<p><strong>2017 BILL DRAFT REQUESTS </strong></p>
<p>Legislators, legislative committees, constitutional officers and state agencies are allotted a certain number of bills each session to change NRS. These bills are first submitted as &ldquo;Bill Draft Requests&rdquo; until the language of the bill has been drafted. A BDR is a precursor to the bill itself.</p>
<p>Below are just some of the BDRs relating to marijuana. Other BDRs exist and there will likely be more submitted before February 6, 2017.</p>

<ul style="margin-left:20px">
<li><strong>BDR 43</strong> (Sponsor: Senator Segerblom): Authorizes local governments to enact ordinances allowing for marijuana social clubs, events and concerts.</li>

<li><strong>BDR 30 </strong>(Sponsor: Senator Farley): Revises provisions relating to controlled substances.</li>

<li><strong>BDR 185</strong> (Sponsor: Senator Segerblom): Prohibits professional licensing boards from taking disciplinary action against licensees due to the licensees' professional involvement with marijuana.</li>

<li><strong>BDR 361</strong> (Sponsor: Senator Segerblom): Provides for a patient&rsquo;s bill of rights.</li>
<li><strong>BDR 40-545</strong> (Sponsor: Senator Segerblom): Establishes the Early Start Program for recreational marijuana.</li>

<li><strong>BDR 14-559</strong> (Senate Judiciary Committee): Revises provisions relating to marijuana.</li>

<li><strong>BDR 321</strong> (Sponsor: Senator Segerblom): Authorizes Nevada&rsquo;s governor to enter into compacts with Native American tribes in Nevada concerning the regulation of marijuana as well as revises provisions relating to a tribal marijuana program in Nevada.</li>

<li><strong>BDR 43-598</strong> (Sponsor: Assembly Judiciary Committee). Revises provisions related to marijuana and the operation of a vehicle or vessel.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the BDRs are self-explanatory, while others are less clear. We will not know what laws they seek to change and how they seek to change them until the BDR becomes an actual bill.</p>

<p><strong>ONE TO WATCH: Consumption Lounges (BDR 43)</strong></p>
<p>One BDR that will be closely followed and sponsored by Senator Tick Segerblom proposes allowing local municipalities to authorize marijuana consumption in social clubs, concerts and other areas. Currently, marijuana consumption is prohibited in public and this has left some business owners wondering if they will be permitted to allow consumption in their private businesses. This bill would allow local governments to clarify the issue of private consumption within a business <br /> as well as to allow for social clubs or <br /> other areas of consumption outside of a personal residence, if the local government so chooses.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>THE ROLE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN NEVADA’S MARIJUANA MARKET</title>
		<link>https://elevatenv.com/the-role-of-local-government-in-nevadas-marijuana-market/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2016 was a huge year for marijuana. On election night, several states passed recreational and medical initiatives to legalize marijuana, making it one of the most successful years for the industry. Nevada contributed to this success by passing the ballot initiative to legalize adult-use marijuana beginning in 2017. But the new recreational market brings about the same question as the existing medical marijuana market &mdash; what is the role of local government?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The federal government&rsquo;s relationship with state governments, especially regarding marijuana, is often discussed and frequently publicized. As has become evident during the past few years, states can legalize marijuana despite the illegality on the federal level; but what about a state&rsquo;s relationship with their local governments? The answer is still unclear. For example, the current role of local government in Nevada&rsquo;s medical marijuana is still debated, despite the industry&rsquo;s existence in Nevada since 2014. However, one thing is clear -- local governments will have some amount of control when confronting the controversial industry.</p>

<p><strong>Local Government Bans</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some local governments have already implemented a blanket ban on marijuana. For example, since Nevada&rsquo;s legalization of medical marijuana, Boulder City has yet to allow any medical marijuana businesses to operate within city limits. One can assume the same prohibition will carry on with the recreational market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henderson, which comprises a prominent portion of Southern Nevada, is currently considering a yearlong or six-month prohibition on marijuana. The moratorium would halt all commercial activity related to recreational marijuana in 2017 with the intention to wait and see what the Nevada Legislature does with the initiative. The Henderson City Council&rsquo;s main concerns appear to be over public health and zoning issues, including the locations of recreational marijuana dispensaries. The Henderson City Council justifies their decision to consider the moratorium by giving deference to the State Legislature to work out the details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clark County, which encompasses the greater Las Vegas Valley, also recently discussed issues regarding adult-use marijuana in Nevada. Clark County began their local recreational licensing discussion by looking at other states' recreational practices and by looking at Nevada&rsquo;s current medical marijuana procedures. Clark County most likely will create a new regulatory code for &ldquo;retail marijuana&rdquo; to create local concepts unique to recreational use of marijuana. The County may require similar application procedures as they do with medical marijuana, which includes environmental plans, safety measures, and background checks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While a lot of the requirements most likely will mirror those of the medical marijuana industry, it appears Clark County will pay special and close attention to the retail industry&rsquo;s consumption (especially the location of consumption and driving laws).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If local governments choose not to enforce a moratorium, they have other options to regulate the industry within their district lines. For instance, local jurisdictions can implement different license fees if they so choose; for example, the city of Las Vegas business license fee can differ from Henderson. Localities can also implement different permit and filing fees, and require more or less documentation of business plans.</p>

<p><strong>Local Land Use Permits </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land use permits are another way for local governments to keep tabs on marijuana establishments. Land use permits are given by the city or county in which the establishment is located. Land use permits may vary from city to city, or county to county; the application, fees, and other requirements can be different in North Las Vegas as opposed to Henderson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The majority of states that have legalized marijuana in some form implement the permits so localities can manage the industry in their communities. For example, Clark County Commissioners can use land use permits to determine the appropriate locations for recreational marijuana establishments within the county. Special use permits are at the discretion of the governing body and thus the local government can control the areas where the establishments are allowed or prohibited. The County intends to draft its own local regulations and ordinances likely <em>before</em> Nevada implements the relevant state regulations for recreational marijuana (as it did with medical marijuana). These local licensing regulations can vary from other counties, local governments, and state regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, it will be interesting to see what happens in the near future with Nevada&rsquo;s adult-use industry. While some jurisdictions might limit or prohibit marijuana establishments, other jurisdictions might take advantage of the booming industry and use the market to benefit their communities. For now, Nevada&rsquo;s adult-use amendment will move forward, and only time will tell how it will fair in each locality.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In addition to being the interim CEO and board of director for Nevada Organic Remedies, parent company to The+Source medical dispensary, Las Vegas native Andrew Jolley is currently serving as president of the Nevada Dispensary Association. Jolley brings a depth of business knowledge to the cannabis space that he has garnered as CEO and owner of EquiSource, a real estate investment firm, and as a partner at CapSource, a private commercial real estate lender. Read on to find out his plans for the cannabis industry in 2017.

I wanted to be part of what I see as a massive change in our state and in our country about how we view cannabis.

</a></h4>

<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Patience -- nothing happens quickly in real estate. It’s a matter of expectations. With the medical marijuana program everybody expected us to go from a few thousand patients to 60,000 patients in a matter of months, in reality it’s going to take a few years to get there. Plus, we probably had unrealistic expectations about how quickly our regulators would get up to speed on the learning curve and so we have had some issues we have had to sort out with our regulators and our elected officials about how to run this program. But, overall, I think everyone has done a good job up until this point.

It’s really twofold, first is to help usher in adult-use sales in a responsible way and second is to strengthen the medical program.

My goals are to reduce the cost and headache for medical patients and to help dispensary owners build solid companies. We want to reduce both the cost of the patient card and potentially the cost of the product by reducing taxes.

WHAT WAS THE ONE THING THAT SWAYED NEVADANS TO LEGALIZE ADULT-USE CANNABIS IN NOVEMBER? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Common sense. This issue can be very divisive and very emotional for some people but when you step back and look at the facts and the history of the war on drugs and how marijuana has been unfairly lumped in with a lot of every bad substances, the vast majority of Americans agree that we have treated this natural plant horribly unfairly and that it’s time for a change. Nationally, 57 percent of Americans now believe that marijuana should be legalized and almost 80 percent agree with legalizing medical marijuana so we are seeing a massive change in public perception and we saw that play out here in Nevada in November.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

If I have learned anything in the past couple of years, it’s that I shouldn’t try to predict what a Trump administration will or can do. But I truly believe the industry will continue to grow and flourish, although there is a lot of uncertainty around Attorney General Sessions. I don’t see a scenario where he would want to pick a fight with 57 to 80 percent of Americans and dozens of states who have legalized medical and eight states who have legalized adult-use. So my hope is that he takes a pragmatic approach and finds a way to continue President Obama’s strategy of deprioritizing cannabis from a law enforcement standpoint.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

My biggest goal is to help the industry continue to grow and develop in a way that benefits the community. That means giving back to the community, creating jobs for the community, paying taxes, and, in some cases, changing peoples’ perceptions of marijuana. The best way to accomplish all of those goals is to run clean and successful businesses here in our state.

<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

That all of the things I was told growing up about cannabis, with very few exceptions, were absolutely wrong. Cannabis is not a gateway drug, it doesn’t cause lung cancer, it doesn’t have high rates of addiction, but instead it has so many potential health benefits that we are just now understanding from a scientific standpoint.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The focus of this Grower&rsquo;s Spotlight is <a href="http://veritascannabis.com/">Veritas Cannabis</a>, which recently doubled its grow operation. &ldquo;We started as a white label company because Colorado&rsquo;s market was saturated with generally low-quality cannabis. We knew we were doing something unique because our end results stood out. We initially occupied half of a 24,000-square-foot building. It had small rooms where we could employ our boutique style of growing. The modularity of multiple small rooms meant that we could scale it up by building out more rooms,&rdquo; explained Mike Leibowitz, one of three partners at Veritas. &ldquo;When you have a new room that you&rsquo;ve never grown in, you don&rsquo;t know if anything will work at first. In our case, we&rsquo;ve occupied our new place for only a month and 75 percent of it contains plants.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><br /> Facility Expansion<br /> </strong>&ldquo;We planned it out internally for months,&rdquo; Leibowitz said of the expansion. &ldquo;We knew exactly how we wanted to build, how we wanted to focus our efforts, how we wanted to scale up, and it was all very natural.&rdquo; <br /> A year ago Veritas signed a lease for the other half of its 24,000-square-foot building, completing renovation and construction in November 2016. Currently Veritas has 15 flowering rooms measuring roughly 600 square feet with approximately 24 lights. &ldquo;In our new expansion, we decided to use a computer system to collect analytical data. Now we get alerts when an air conditioner or other equipment goes down,&rdquo; offered Leibowitz. <br /> Veritas switched from single-ended 1000W HPS bulbs to HID DE HPS bulbs, which allow more coverage. Additionally, each room also has its own growing atmosphere that has:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:20px">
<li>a dedicated air conditioning unit,</li>
<li>CO2 monitoring sensors, and</li>
<li>an exhaust fan that runs during the night cycle to reduce humidity.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Expansion Challenges<br /> </strong>Ramping up to a full-scale environment requires a significant time investment. &ldquo;You have a much tighter schedule. We had to maintain a rigorous schedule to not fall behind or let plants spoil and die,&rdquo; said Leibowitz. <strong><br /> </strong>Finding personnel is also a challenge, especially in a relatively small industry like Colorado. Veritas generally finds new hires through word of mouth. &ldquo;Anybody can cook an egg but it&rsquo;s challenging to cook a perfect omelet. We feel the same way about cultivating marijuana. You can easily grow cheap weed and smoke it. But to grow great cannabis is a labor-intensive project. We look for passionate people, often younger, who know they&rsquo;re going to do hard work for a long time because they love the challenge. They love taking a small plant and watching it grow,&rdquo; explained Leibowitz. <br /> <br /> <strong>Complications<br /> </strong>Veritas hired an architect, electricians, HVAC companies, and a construction company to design and build its facility. The initial planning and legal work was all completed internally.<br /> Leibowitz noted that agencies and regulations can hamper your growth because some agencies and departments have overlapping, contradictory rules. &ldquo;For example, the MED (Marijuana Enforcement Division) may want locks that open a specific way, and the fire department wants the doors to open another way,&rdquo; said Leibowitz. &ldquo;You will also run into unexpected timing issues, which lead to increased costs and lost profits. For example, you&rsquo;ll wait for a bunch of lights and when they get installed, you realize you need a power upgrade. Then you have to wait for the power company.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Advice for Growers Seeking to Scale</strong><br /> The first piece of advice Leibowitz offers business owners is to curb their expectations. &ldquo;You will need to explore the needs of growing and balance them against your budget. Expect delays. Expect price increases. Expect to spend more than you have budgeted,&rdquo; he counseled.<strong><br /> </strong>Throughout the process, communication is critical. &ldquo;Uncertainty and unpredictability have become the status quo in the industry,&rdquo; said Leibowitz. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we conduct regular, biweekly meetings. We&rsquo;re constantly making sure we&rsquo;re growing properly and correcting mistakes.&rdquo;<br /> Planning is another critical step, according to Leibowitz. &ldquo;You should start the scaling process by asking yourself some questions: What is your business model? Where are you located? Do you want quality cannabis or lots of cannabis? Budget and your preferences change how you grow your business.&rdquo; <br /> If you&rsquo;ve never expanded before, take the time to learn how to build a grow. There will be a lot of trial and error so Leibowitz advises that if you don&rsquo;t have the time or money to learn and make mistakes, then hire a consultant.</p>

		<title>CBD OIL GIVES HOPE TO PARENTS OF INFANT BORN WITH BRAIN DAMAGE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Three-and-a-half-year-old Marco Rivera was born blind and deaf, among other maladies, due to anoxic damage, which means lack of oxygen to the brain. His umbilical cord was stretched to the point where it didn&rsquo;t provide oxygen to his brain for a period of time causing damage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Basically they told us Marco&rsquo;s never going to walk. Marco&rsquo;s never going to talk. Marco&rsquo;s blind. Marco&rsquo;s deaf,&rdquo; said Jose Rivera, Marco&rsquo;s father, who noted at birth his son was given six months to live.</p>
<p>Facing such dire consequences, the Riveras were desperate and in search of options. Their search led them to Dr. Kathleen Smith, a Las Vegas doctor who has been treating patients with medical cannabis since 2010.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His doctors had basically told the family there was nothing more that could be done for him and that he was just going to die. So there were no further options. They came to me to see if I thought CBD would do anything for him. I told the Riveras, &lsquo;CBD won&rsquo;t hurt him, and if there is a part of the brain still functioning, CBD will help that part of the brain take over other functions.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>As to whether CBD would work, Dr. Smith wasn&rsquo;t sure. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know then and still don&rsquo;t know how much improvement they will get. I have no way of knowing because none of us actually know how much of the brain is still functioning. But I do know this, none of us use all of our brain and what happens with damaged brains of children is other parts of the brain will take over the functions so you just have to wait and see if you can trigger the other part of the brain and take over the function.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a year of CBD oil being administered through his g-tube, something has definitely been triggered in Marco&rsquo;s brain. &ldquo;Marco is legally blind and deaf and he went from 100 percent blind and deaf to cortical hearing and cortical vision. Just how much he hears and how much he sees hasn&rsquo;t been determined but he is responsive and as far as seeing, he does track people and responds to flashes of light. As far as noises and hearing things, you talk to him and he turns his head toward you. Overall, I was just looking for a little bit of motor movement and I got a lot more than I was asking for,&rdquo; enthused Marco&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>Dr. Smith is also pleased with Marco&rsquo;s progress. &ldquo;He is so much more alert, he very rapidly moves his head, and stares at you if you are talking to him, he moves his arms a lot more, all of his movements are a lot more purposeful. You know he is hearing well because he even hears a slight sound now and responds to it. You can see that there is part of the brain that is increasing its functionally. Now we are going to encourage the next phase which is to get him to swallow so we can take the g-tube out and he can actually start to eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He started off with pages of medication and once he got off all of that and he was released fully to the hemp oil, it changed my boy in every way,&rdquo; Rivera says. &ldquo;He actually goes to school already, too. He gets home pre-school. It&rsquo;s remarkable how he has progressed.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When adult-use cannabis becomes a legal ingredient in one of the world&rsquo;s finest culinary destinations you can expect an abundance of creativity. Now that Nevada&rsquo;s residents have voted in recreational marijuana, cannabis-infused dinners are sure to start popping up. Once regulations are put in place as is projected for sometime this summer, cannabis-infused dinners will be commonplace and you more than likely will be invited to one. Just like attending a wine, tequila or beer paired dining, cannabis, too, will be the highlight of the event.</p>
<p>The trend has already begun. There are TV shows focused on infused dinners such as Viceland&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bong Appetit&rdquo; and VH1&rsquo;s &ldquo;Martha &amp; Snoop's Potluck Dinner Party.&rdquo; Adult-use cannabis states have already jumped on the infusion bandwagon, too. In California, MJU High Dining holds Sushi and Doobie Rolling Workshops and Colorado&rsquo;s Cultivating Spirits offers gourmet three-course fine dining experiences featured during its food, cannabis and wine tours.</p>
<p>One such party was recently held in Las Vegas by newly formed Dope Dining, an event company that hopes to hold infused dining events on a quarterly basis. Dubbed &lsquo;High on Love,&rsquo; the vision for the party was &ldquo;to merge both my art world and my cannabis world together for a nice dinner party,&rdquo; said Shannon Dorn, founder of Dope Dining.</p>
<p>Dorn was successful in bringing her vision to life. The dinner, which was more of a mixer, was a very casual affair with topless servers adorned in strategically placed black body paint passing tapas to guests while a belly dancer, tarot card reader, artist, and singers performed throughout the evening. Like any gathering, the key to a good party is creating a positive vibe.</p>
<p>One of the other keys is serving delicious food, especially when that&rsquo;s the evening&rsquo;s focal point. Chef Brandi Madison undoubtedly knows how to cook and, even better, knows how to cook with cannabis. (A few of chef Madison&rsquo;s tapas dishes from the dinner party are listed on pages 12-13.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cook with intention and my intention is for everyone to embrace the flavors of the cannabis, and the flavors of the cuisine. I don&rsquo;t want either one to get lost. I like for them to be blended,&rdquo; explained Madison, who is a 2007 Art Institute of California-Los Angeles graduate. &ldquo;I felt like with the sauces you got a good taste of the cannabis and what the actual sauce was like. With the chimichurri, you could really taste the cannabis but you could also taste the onions and the herbs as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This brings up another essential element to hosting a cannabis-infused dinner party -- a dosing strategy. At &lsquo;High on Love,&rsquo; chef Madison dosed the four tapas dishes being passed by servers and, very wisely, she infused the sauces that included chimichurri, roasted tomatillo, chipotle cream, honey barbeque, and au jus used for the various meats at the carving session so diners could dose themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every 30 minutes a tapas plate was going to come out, but in the meantime we still wanted people to have access while they were mingling so we came up with the idea for the carving station. Meats were not infused but sauces were infused. We tried to keep the sauces low, I think the strongest one might have been 12 milligrams. That was the plan to allow people to dose themselves,&rdquo; explained chef Madison, whose cannabis cooking experience includes a recent edible processing class through training organization Trim Ready.</p>
<p>Madison&rsquo;s strategy for the evening included more than dosing, she also wanted to manipulate the guest experience. &ldquo;What I did with the tapas was to alternate sativa, indicia, sativa, indica. It was kind of like playing with the high -- no one is ever too up or too down. By manipulating the high, we brought people up with sativa, and next we brought people down, and the next one we brought people back up, then back down. Finally with the dessert, we brought people back up so they would leave on a high note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dorn estimates on average each partygoer probably ingested about 70-100 milligrams of cannabis throughout the night, between the tapas and the sauces. Lemon Bite desserts, very similar in size and concept to a cakepop, topped with Lemon Jack Terpene chocolate were also available for diners who were encouraged to take them home as they were 50 milligrams each.</p>
<p>Terpene-infused water was also on the menu. &ldquo;Terpenes won&rsquo;t get you high but they will have the same effects,&rdquo; explained Dorn. &ldquo;If Lemon Haze makes you creative and happy then you will get the same effect from the terpene, without the euphoric or high feeling.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>elevate</em> spoke with a few guests, post-party who were first-timers to the cannabis-infused dinner scene. &ldquo;I typically have a low tolerance. I will eat a quarter of something. During the party I ate every tapas that came out, I also had some of the pork belly with barbeque sauce and the steak with chimichurri, and both sauces were dosed,&rdquo; said Jolene Mannina, owner of Relish. &ldquo;I definitely took in more than I normally do or at least based off what the dose was. I did not feel at any time weighted down or out of my element. I just felt really good and really happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don Decatur also tried every dish and estimates he ingested somewhere between 400-500 milligrams. &ldquo;I was honestly expecting overly cannabis tasting items and for them to have a much stronger, not so pleasant effect. It was amazing! <br /> I love good food and every dish was topnotch.&rdquo;</p>
<br />
<br />
<div style="padding:15px; background:#e4e4e4">
<h2>Tips for the First-timer</h2>
<p>There are a few things to know before you attend a cannabis-infused dinner. If you are new to consuming cannabis, start low and go slow. A typical edible dose ranges between 10 and 20 milligrams per serving. With edibles it typically takes 20 to 40 minutes to feel the effects. Knowing this information should help you educate and appropriately pace yourself. Below are some tips from the pros.</p>

<ul>
<li>The biggest mistake you can make is not to go, advises Dope Dining&rsquo;s Shannon Dorn. She also says to ask questions of your servers so you are educated about what you are eating and enjoy yourself.</li>

<li>Chef Brandi Madison counsels not to be nervous or overwhelmed and to pace yourself. &ldquo;I have had some people eat stuff and don&rsquo;t feel anything and have had some people eat one cookie and they are so high. It&rsquo;s going to be relative to your body and your constitution so go in with the best of intentions and expectations.&rdquo;</li>

<li>Eat before you go as an empty stomach can make the effects of cannabis happen quicker and be more intense.</li>

<li>Should you overmedicate and need to counteract the psycho-activity of THC, CBD will help. &ldquo;Take some CBD oil because that will bring you back down into your body and take you out of your head. Have some CBD handy and take a couple of drops so you have more of a body high and less of a head high,&rdquo; advises chef Madison.&nbsp;</li>

<li>Another tip if you have consumed too much is to drink lots of water. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best thing you can do. It&rsquo;s usually anxiety that gets the best of people. All you have to do is drink some water and go to sleep and you will be fine,&rdquo; says chef Madison.</li>

<li>Finally, take a cab or Uber/Lyft afterward so you can enjoy as much as you want without having to drive impaired, advises Don Decatur.</li>
</ul>

		<title>HEALING &amp; HEAVENLY HYBRIDS</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Justin Alexander</h4>
<p>Indica-sativa crosses blend the benefits of pain relief with mental alertness combining to become the best of both worlds all rolled up into one. &ldquo;Hybrids are so popular because they can offer relief for a wide variety of conditions and, because they have such a diverse terpene profile, the range of flavors is endless,&rdquo; says Nick Powell, director of cultivation and production at Summa Cannabis.</p>
<p>A hybrid plant results from a cross of genetically different plants. This results in hybrids being sativa- or indica-dominant, with the effects to match, or they can be an even split. Often called super strains, connoisseurs and beginners alike are attracted to hybrids because they possess all the best aspects of parent plants and have tremendous diversity in their terpene content and, thus, a wider spectrum of treatment possibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evergreen Organix Girl Scout Cookies</strong></p>
<p>THC: 20.77%; CBD: .06%</p>
<p>A beautiful flower in more ways than one, Girl Scout Cookies (GSC) first captivates with the glory of its buds&mdash;orange hairs, purple leaves and green calyxes&mdash;and then hits hard with the complex olfactory appeal of oak and cedar. The name, however, has caused some controversy. According to Evergreen Organix president Jerry Velarde, &ldquo;in late 2016, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission banned the sale of Girl Scout Cookies and about 20 other strains like Candyland and Cinderella whose names could make them potentially attractive to children.&rdquo; Despite this roadblock, its popularity has not waned in other West Coast markets.</p>
<p>Evergreen Organix&rsquo;s GSC, an OG Kush and Durban Poison Hybrid cross, is definitely milder than other varieties so it&rsquo;s great for during-the-day pain relief, or to curb nausea and stimulate the appetite. Its effects will transport you on a journey with cerebral intensity and comfortable body melt. Another benefit is that it smokes smoothly and is all around relaxing and enjoyable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Tryke Gold Label Honey Bear Kush </strong></p>
<p>THC: 20.68%; CBD: .04%</p>
<p>With the rich and sugary smell of honey, this strain is true to its name. &ldquo;Honey Bear Kush came to us from a grower we have worked with in the past,&rdquo; says Tryke&rsquo;s Marketing Director Adam Laikin. &ldquo;The genetics are unknown, but [its] taste and aroma [are] similar to a fresh jar of honey&mdash;smooth, sweet and piney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Recommended for pain, stress and sleep problems, Laikin says Honey Bear Kush falls on the indica side of the hybrid spectrum and has a rich terpene profile. &ldquo;It will provide the classic heavy-hitting indica benefits but leave patients more alert and able to function,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;High in Beta-Myrcene, Beta-Caryophyllene, and Alpha-Pinene, it&rsquo;s no mystery where this staple cannabis strain gets its flavor, aroma and medicinal benefits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A relaxing body high, its effects can be felt in both small and large doses&mdash;without the negative of not being able to get off the couch. It&rsquo;s deep, sweet, almost cognac flavor smokes smooth and creamy. Using Honey Bear Kush flower allows full enjoyment of the therapeutic benefits of the strain as it naturally occurs and the ability to get lost in this pure golden gem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The+Source&rsquo;s <br /> Blue Gorilla </strong></p>
<p>THC: 84%; CBD: .9%; CBN: .16%</p>
<p>Using a careful distillation process, The+Source crafts its exotic cannabis flower of Blue Dream, Blueberry Diesel and Kong, extracted via CO2, into an untainted vape liquid. From there, The+Source team adds its extra creative spin by coming up with a cool name for the blended product. &ldquo;More research goes into the task than you would first think, as we would rather not use a name that is already active in the canna-scape,&rdquo; says Chris Vickers, general manager of The+Source. &ldquo;[There is] a lot of R&amp;D and respect for the science that drives the art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Packed and potent, The+Source produces a clear distillate cartridge that ranges between 80-90 percent total cannabinoids. &ldquo;Vaporizing provides patients with a means of safely ingesting the active cannabinoids, terpenoids, and flavonoids found in their favorite strains, but it also removes the risk of inhaling potentially carcinogenic fumes from plant material that is lit on fire,&rdquo; Vickers says.</p>
<p>Blue Gorilla summons an even and mellow high&mdash;relieving pain, reducing inflammation, and curbing anxiety. This is a great body relaxer with an engaging cerebral edge, giving you the confidence to tackle most any task without nervousness. As a bonus, &ldquo;it contains the cannabinoids CBC and CBG, which some stake claim to inhibiting cancer cell growth,&rdquo; says Vickers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Euphoria Wellness' Grease Monkey</strong></p>
<p>THC: 23.2 %; CBD: .04%</p>
<p>An even split between indica and sativa, Grease Monkey was developed by Exotic Genetix using a Gorilla Glue #4 mother and a Cookies &lsquo;n Cream father. Of Grease Monkey&rsquo;s terpene profile, Nick Powell, director of cultivation and production at Summa Cannabis, says, &ldquo;Limonene is a mood elevator and stress reliever and Beta-Caryophyllene [acts as both] an antidepressant and anxiety buster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Powell is a big proponent of terpenes, noting that: &ldquo;To experience the full effect of cannabis, and the wide range of benefits that it can have, the cannabinoid and terpene profiles have to be preserved,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Beneficial phytochemicals are lost in all forms of extraction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grease Monkey has an aroma and flavor that can be characterized as spicy, oily and strong. After even a small sample, get ready for it to immediately tackle your pain and provide total relaxation of tense muscles, relieving anxiety and building in intensity with every passing moment. Grease Monkey will make your eyelids heavy while taking your body to another plane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kynd Lyte hybrid vape pen</strong></p>
<p>THC: 38.22%; CBD: .13%; CBN: .29%</p>
<p>Known for products that are friendly to the beginners&rsquo; market, Kynd Lyte is ideal for those seeking a less intense high that&rsquo;s balanced with relief from depression, insomnia, pain, and lack of appetite. &ldquo;Kynd Lyte pen features premium cannabis oil extracted via supercritical CO2 for purity and organic MCT oil,&rdquo; says Kynd Cannabis Company owner Mark Pitchford, noting that the name reflects the lighter THC content, as well as a play on the company name. Standout characteristics of the Kynd Lyte pen are its clean, light taste and lack of viscosity. Due to low THC, Kynd Lyte is the perfect enhancement for a busy day filled with engaged activity. Patients can make this a go-to for when they need to be at a high functioning level for many hours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>O.penVape Chunky D Pure CO2 oil applicator</strong></p>
<p>It all starts with the flower from which this oil is extracted, which is a 50/50 hybrid of Chocolate Chunk (indica) and Sour Diesel (sativa). &ldquo;The bud bursts with beautiful amber pistols that embrace the thick chunky nuggets, thus the name,&rdquo; says Jonathon Cline of O.penVape. &ldquo;When preparing the flower for extraction, one is greeted with pungent cacao deep musk diesel aromas. After extraction, the oil has a transparent dark blonde coloration and a sappy consistency denoting the decarboxylation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks to undeniably diverse cannabinoid and terpene profiles, this hybrid induces a loose and bright experience for the mind and body. But the complexities don&rsquo;t end there and this is no average hybrid. &ldquo;As a topical, the high Ocimene content can act as an antifungal, antibacterial, and antiseptic,&rdquo; Cline says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The batches highest in Caryophyllene are a great recommendation for patients suffering from Crohn&rsquo;s disease or any other gastrointestinal issues due to its antispasmodic properties,&rdquo; says Margaux Hansberry of O.penVape. &ldquo;The combination of such a diverse cannabinoid and terpene profile that works synergistically together make for a perfect cure-all no matter what the ailment. The uses are endless. You can use this syringe applicator topically, buccally, sublingually, as an edible, to dress a joint, bowl, blunt, as a low temp dab, in capsules, as an intimacy oil, on a tampon, or as a suppository.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the palate, notes of overripe fruit first engage the senses, then after a few minutes comes the droopy eyelids but without sleepiness. There&rsquo;s no anxiety here though, this is a clear-headed, even high that comes on slow and steady. One major bonus for anyone trying to lose weight is that this hybrid curbs the appetite versus stimulating it. Get ready to smile all day and be as busy as a bee. &ldquo;It makes for a great happy hour strain perfect for staying social, serene, and tranquil,&rdquo; offers Hansberry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Giddy Up&rsquo;s Golden Lemons</strong></p>
<p>THC: 806%; CBD: 1.9%</p>
<p>A hybrid concentrate, Golden Lemons live resin shatter is everything the name claims as it is both bright in color and has a strong citrus taste and smell. High in THC, Golden Lemons is recommended for experienced cannabis users and it is also preferred for making concentrates such as live resin and shatter. After one dab of this yellow-haired beauty, the effects immediately overtake you, relaxing every inch of flesh from head-to-toe alleviating aches and muscle tensions caused by stress. Coming on quick, not only does it work for the body, but it also enhances the mind with sparks of clarity&mdash;as such the cyclical high rotates between the physical and the cerebral for a sustained duration. This is best enjoyed at night&mdash;think of it as an appetizer&mdash;when you find yourself ready for a tasty dinner and then some zone out TV time as the cares of the day fall away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>State Flower Cannabis&rsquo; Madman OG</strong></p>
<p>THC: 23.3 %; CBD: .06%</p>
<p>Hybrids are well loved but not all fall in the class of exceptional. State Flower Cannabis&rsquo; Madman OG, a cross of LA Confidential and OG Kush, definitely ranks in that realm&mdash;highly lauded as an appetite stimulant, a whole-body relaxer, and a lifesaver for insomniacs. This indicia-dominate blend has been known to go against the strain and can sometimes induce a burst of energy to help you get things done for a high that can be likened to a few shots of espresso. Adding to the Madman OG experience is a sublime taste of coffee and nutty earth aromas. But most often this hybrid should be used for its chill factor, wiping away a host of ailments such as depression, nausea, pain and cramps. Expect a deeply relaxed state&mdash;with some giggles for good measure&mdash;for an all-around next-level experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>remedy' s Bio Diesel</strong></p>
<p>THC: 20.1%</p>
<p>A mix of several popular diesel strains, Bio Diesel is a catchall hybrid that is reliable for balancing both the body and mind. You will first be lifted up by the sativa effects, which accounts for alertness and engagement of the senses, then fall into relaxation and be swept away on an unforgettable trip that has been recognized by cannabis lovers with numerous awards and accolades. &ldquo;After smoking this hybrid strain, you'll be wide awake, euphoric and motivated for several hours before fading into a relaxing body high,&rdquo; describes Braly Joy of Silver Sage Wellness. What&rsquo;s even better than the creative euphoria common with this hybrid is the sweet, juicy diesel flavor profile. Bio Diesel is a skunky and delightful fusion of Sour Diesel, Sensi Star, Original Diesel, and NYC Diesel ushering you into pure enjoyment. Joy cites this strain as good for those suffering from PTSD, chronic pain, chronic stress, ADD/ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression and eye pressure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cannabiotix Orange Crush</strong></p>
<p>THC: 26.7%; 0.06% CBD</p>
<p>Imagine peeling an orange, taking in its fresh scent and biting into the juicy pulp&mdash;tart yet sweet. The same can be said of Cannabiotix Orange Crush, a sativa dominant hybrid bred from a cross between California Orange and Blueberry, whose dense frosty buds are accented with hairs that appear in neon orange and with notes both familiar and fun.</p>
<p>This bud packs tremendous power&mdash;from the taste and smell of the flower to the long-lasting high. Falling closely in line with sativa characteristics, Orange Crush is both heady and relaxing taking your overall being on a happy journey filled with lots of laughter and good times. Expect effects that last for several hours due to the potency of this strain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Orange Crush aids with inflammation, muscle spasms, pain and stress,&rdquo; says Neema Samari, Chief Operating Officer of Cannabiotix. &ldquo;Crush is a perfect blend of cerebral head high and a relaxed full body high. People enjoy hybrids because they offer the best of both worlds. Often times indica lovers prefer hybrids over sativas when it comes to a daytime smoking option because it gives them a body buzz with a dash of upbeat head high [allowing] them to keep going and not get bogged down and tired in mid- to late afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Matrix Redux</strong></p>
<p><em>Due to a mix-up, we ran an incorrect sativa review for Matrix&rsquo;s Super Sour Diesel in the January issue (page 17). Please find the correct one to follow. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Matrix&rsquo;s Super Sour Diesel</strong></p>
<p>THC: 27%; CBD: less than 1%</p>
<p>Matrix Super Sour Diesel, one of the most popular strains on the market, is pesticide-free making it good for the body as well as the mind. &ldquo;What you are testing was grown in a soilless medium with a hybrid of mineral and organic nutrients followed by a ten-day flush in an indoor state-of-the-art cultivation facility,&rdquo; says Evan Marder, chief operating officer of Matrix NV, LLC. &ldquo;No pesticides were used in this process.&rdquo;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Julie Vigil</h4>

<p>Oftentimes, pet owners with really sick animals find themselves in what one Las Vegas vet calls a &ldquo;black box,&rdquo; where traditional Western medicine kind of ends and doesn&rsquo;t have any more answers or treatment options &mdash; typically just more synthetic pharmaceuticals that come with their own laundry list of side effects and warnings.</p>
<p>When a doctor tells you, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got nothing else for you,&rdquo; veterinarian Nancy Brandt, DVM, said, &ldquo;I just think, that does not make sense to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Brandt of the Natural Care Institute (<em>nancybrandtdvm.com</em>), a holistic veterinary office, is not alone. So many pet parents are unsatisfied their four-legged companions must live with an ailment, disease, or ongoing condition that comes with a life sentence for prescription drugs. They want to provide the same level of quality care and comfort for their pets as they seek out for themselves, ideally using natural ingredients that complement their pet&rsquo;s individual systems and needs.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>THERE&rsquo;S LIFE IN THIS OLD DOG YET</strong></p>
<p>Sandra Harvey, a nurse, teacher, and foster dog mom for Vegas Shepherd Rescue (<em>vegasshepherdrescue.com</em>), is caring for Karbon, a German Shepherd who was believed to be 11 years old from the looks of his advanced periodontal disease. Just before Thanksgiving 2016, when the initial fostering process began and Karbon was with his veterinarian, he experienced severe seizures that totally incapacitated him and lasted well over an hour. The doctor prescribed Prozac, observed him then sent him home with foster mom Harvey, and everyone hoped for the best. Within the first few days at home, Karbon had more severe seizure episodes and more emergency trips to the veterinarian. The vet added phenobarbital and then Keppra, both well-known and very strong anti-seizure meds, to his regimen, hoping to quell the terrifying spasms and give him some quality of life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seizures were coming about every week (on the prescription meds),&rdquo; Harvey said. &ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t quite as severe as the original ones and you could now identify clusters. He would have a seizure and then after about 15 minutes or so he would seem to be fine and then he&rsquo;d fall over and have another one. I still didn&rsquo;t feel that this was a good option for a dog that was adoptable for a family to have to try to deal with this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Karbon&rsquo;s vet believed a brain tumor was the underlying cause of the seizures, but really couldn&rsquo;t know for sure, and putting the dog under anesthesia to perform a CT or MRI <br /> to find out was definitely not ideal for his well-being, or Harvey&rsquo;s wallet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I felt like I was in limbo land,&rdquo; Harvey said. &ldquo;I believe very strongly that holistic medicine complements traditional medicine, so I reached out to my holistic vet and asked if we could talk about cannabis oil. I had (suggested it) to the vets but they weren&rsquo;t really open to it only because there&rsquo;s not a lot of scientific literature out there. It&rsquo;s a medication that is illegal. But I thought, we don&rsquo;t have a lot of options here. Karbon&rsquo;s either a hospice dog or if he&rsquo;s not, he&rsquo;s an unadoptable dog. But he&rsquo;s a great dog, he has a great personality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Brandt examined Karbon and recommended CBD (cannabidiol, which is the non-psychoactive compound of cannabis) oil which supports the body&rsquo;s endocannabinoid system. Harvey noticed marked differences in days. &ldquo;Within a week he really started becoming a different dog. I mean, his little personality started changing, he had more pep in his step, he seemed to be a lot more alert. The first bit that I had him, he was just sort of in la-la land. And now, we&rsquo;re kind of thinking as he starts to come out of everything, that he&rsquo;s more in the age group of around seven, not 11 (years old).&rdquo;</p>
<p>About 10 days later, Karbon had another cluster of seizures but Harvey reports that they were only a quarter of the intensity of the first seizures she experienced with him, and the entire episode this time lasted for less than five minutes. Harvey and Brandt are adjusting Karbon&rsquo;s CBD oil dosage to try to dial in to his sweet spot. And he has had no negative side effects at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am extremely pleased with where he&rsquo;s come from, from the very scary one-hour seizures to now it being less than five minutes, and the timeframe is now ten days in between the seizure activity,&rdquo; Harvey said. At their last appointment, Dr. Brandt told Harvey that over time she hoped to wean Karbon off of his traditional meds altogether. &ldquo;Whether that happens or not, we&rsquo;re kind of on our own road, our own path. But what I have seen so far, it is a good possibility. I don&rsquo;t know if the CBD has to build up in their system, there&rsquo;s no literature that tells us this kind of stuff. It&rsquo;s really an unknown road that we go down, but what I have seen (with cannabis) is far more optimistic than what I have seen with traditional medicine,&rdquo; said Harvey.</p>
<p>Not all pets are dealing with sensitive medical needs akin to Karbon&rsquo;s, sometimes their needs are about general conditions like well-being, itching, anxiety, or joint mobility. When Robert Garcia&rsquo;s dog Sasha was six months old she was diagnosed with hip and elbow dysplasia, a common condition in German Shepherds. Sasha had surgery to remove a bone chip from her elbow but as she&rsquo;s gotten older, her little post-surgical limp and general health took a turn for the worse.</p>
<p>In Sasha&rsquo;s case, DIY hemp-based pet chews and treats like Therabis (therabis.com) or True Leaf Pet (trueleafpet.com) are an option. They can be obtained without a recommendation or doctor&rsquo;s diagnosis, and are legal across North America. Hemp seed doesn&rsquo;t contain any THC and just a trace amount of cannabidiol, or CBD, so it avoids the legal barriers set up against those parts of the cannabis plant which are still federally classified as a Schedule 1 drug. But it doesn&rsquo;t mean it skirts the healthy benefits and results seen with medical-grade CBD oil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do believe that hemp seed by itself does provide some very beneficial properties, mainly from the omega-3s. And there&rsquo;s also some other ingredients that have proven to have beneficial effects for inflammation and other things,&rdquo; explained True Leaf Pet CEO Darcy Bomford, such as green-lipped mussels and L-Theanine. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re focused on a product line that is legal in every state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sasha experienced the beneficial properties of hemp firsthand. &ldquo;My friend owns a store in Las Vegas, Still Smoking Vapor and Smoke Shop (<em>stillsmokinglv.com</em>), and he carries Therabis there. He gave me a few boxes and said to try it and see if it works. It was amazing. It was like a complete turn-around,&rdquo; said Garcia. &ldquo;She was literally up and moving like the product said. She was playing with my other dog outside, she was happy, and she wasn&rsquo;t limping as much. She&rsquo;s still on it to this day. It definitely made a big impact on our lives. I had her on anti-inflammatories every other day but now she only needs them once in a great while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A HORSE OF A DIFFERENT COLOR</strong></p>
<p>Sharon Huddleston gives cannabis to her animals and much like Harvey, is seeing big, positive results with no ill effects. Huddleston&rsquo;s needs are larger than a house pet&rsquo;s needs, however &mdash; she has two rescue horses, Abby and Blue, and a donkey named Mama. Huddleston found her cannabis path with the help of Lance Parvin, co-founder of Las Vegas-based patient co-op Compassion Awareness Project (<em>compassionawarenessproject.org</em>), a consulting and counseling service for alternative treatment options.</p>
<p>Abby is her three-year-old Tobiano Paint, who is a hefty 1,280 pounds and stands 17-&frac12; hands high. She&rsquo;s a nipper and high strung, so Huddleston gives her a CBD oil capsule to calm her disposition. The horse&rsquo;s regimen began with a daily pill, then after two weeks she dropped down to every other day. Now Abby takes CBD oil once a week.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had Abby on cannabis for eight months to a year now and she&rsquo;s doing fantastic,&rdquo; Huddleston said. &ldquo;It has calmed her down to where her demeanor (on a scale) between one and 10, where 10 is crazy and one is very demur, is between a one and a two now. She&rsquo;s absolutely a doll. And the vet says she&rsquo;s the healthiest horse she&rsquo;s ever been around. It has just been a blessing for Abby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huddleston&rsquo;s other rescue, Blue, a beautiful black Quarter horse with a white star on his forehead, was abused by his former owners. Blue gets CBD oil for his skittish demeanor, pain relief, and overall general health. When they first got Blue, Huddleston and her son also treated him with a mixture of cannabis oil and vitamins for his rotting hooves. &ldquo;They were almost in a thrush level because he had been standing in his own poop and pee for, I don&rsquo;t know &mdash; it was awful. He was pathetic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huddleston is sure Blue was in a lot of pain, too. He was so undernourished his ribs were poking out and there was muscle damage to his neck from where they almost choked him to death with a rope. &ldquo;They can&rsquo;t tell you how much pain they&rsquo;re in, you can only watch their muscles quiver when you touch them. You know they&rsquo;ll quiver when it hurts so bad, and they&rsquo;ll back away from you. But now he comes in and says pat me, love me, brush me. I have no problems with him whatsoever anymore. He&rsquo;s just a real love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huddleston started dosing Blue in the same way she did Abby, first to get it built up in his system, but now he gets his cannabis only once every two weeks because he&rsquo;s over 10 years old, she says. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s just so trusting and loving now, I can do anything with him. The cannabis calms him, besides making them very healthy. Blue used to have health issues and now he&rsquo;s just as healthy as he can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dynamic in Huddleston&rsquo;s vet-patient relationship has shifted to where she&rsquo;s teaching her vet about a medicinal treatment rather than the other way around. &ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve been giving cannabis to Abby, (my vet) has been watching me and is very impressed (with the results). I tell her, &lsquo;Hey, I&rsquo;m not an expert but this is what I&rsquo;ve done.&rsquo; She&rsquo;s apprehensive but still open-minded. So, that&rsquo;s good. She&rsquo;s not taking it on face value. She&rsquo;s seeing great results so she says two thumbs up for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huddleston is also witnessing a remarkable transformation in her miniature donkey, Mama, which mirrors the success she&rsquo;s had with her own vision using medical cannabis as a treatment for glaucoma. &ldquo;I think Mama was almost blind. She was having a very hard time focusing and seeing. But now the vet and I are watching her real close and it looks like her vision is improving. I can pull a carrot up now and she sees it; I don&rsquo;t put it to her nose, I test it to her eye and she sees it. She&rsquo;s turning her head and she can see it and knows what I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SHOULD VETS LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE?</strong></p>
<p>Harmonie Basso and her 100-pound Irish Wolfhound cross Franklyn are pretty inseparable. After Basso was in a car accident that left her paralyzed, she adopted Franklyn and a cat named Albert. The doctors didn&rsquo;t give Basso much hope of recovery, but that didn&rsquo;t stop her from pushing through and eventually learning to walk again. By using cannabis, Basso found relief her pharmaceutical medications couldn&rsquo;t touch to help with her pain. So later, when her BFF, best furry friend, Franklyn badly injured his knee and surgery left him with a long-term limp, Basso looked to the same natural remedies that helped her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throughout the healing process, Franklyn&rsquo;s knee was always bothering him,&rdquo; Basso said. &ldquo;The doctor said more than likely he&rsquo;ll need to be on pain medication for the rest of his life, and he was only three. I started researching more and more into what we could do to help him naturally. I didn&rsquo;t like the idea of him always being on pain medication. That&rsquo;s when we found True Leaf Pet. Slowly, as he was taking it, he started to be able to use his leg completely. In the end, I was able to wean him off of all pain medication and now you can barely tell he has a limp at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like knowing that they&rsquo;re really careful about what they put in their treats,&rdquo; Basso added, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s really important to us, like no GMOs, it&rsquo;s grain-free, no artificial flavors, that was all key when I first noticed it in the store, because we try to eat that way for us so I like to feed them that way, too.&rdquo; Basso adds that her cat Albert enjoys a True Leaf Pet chew also (well, a tiny <br /> piece of one anyway) and sits and shakes a paw for his calming treat.</p>
<p>Basso&rsquo;s vet isn&rsquo;t an alternative vet, like Dr. Brandt, but much like Huddleston&rsquo;s horse doctor, Franklyn&rsquo;s doc was open to the possibilities of cannabis, which includes the hemp plant. &ldquo;He always wants to learn more about why I chose to do that, which is great so we can work together. He still strongly recommends lots of medication, but he&rsquo;s alright when I tell him the reason why we&rsquo;re doing this. He&rsquo;s very open to it and never tells me I&rsquo;m doing anything wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For many veterinarians, breaking into the cannabis world is just too new, too fast, and too dangerous. Besides the general social stigmas associated with cannabis and the fact that their medical and pharmaceutical licenses could be on the line for recommending medical marijuana, they are seeing the worst-case scenarios of house pets who have overdosed from getting into a pot &ldquo;stash&rdquo; or marijuana edible and overeating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we see a lot of (marijuana) overdoses,&rdquo; said Dr. Aaron Bivens of South Buffalo Springs Animal Hospital (<em>southbuffalospringsanimalhospital.com</em>). &ldquo;When they eat too much they get intoxicated and we have to hospitalize them to get them through it. With the new law change (allowing recreational marijuana usage) it&rsquo;s going to be more readily available, so you have to be more careful. It&rsquo;s like if you leave gum out, your dog&rsquo;s going to get toxic poisoning. If you leave a chocolate bar out, it&rsquo;s going to get chocolate toxicity. You just have to be a responsible user so your dog is not exposed to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stephen Katz, DVM, and founder of Therabis, a hemp-based CBD product for pets, is excited about the prospects of medicinal cannabis use but understands doctors&rsquo; hesitation. &ldquo;Right now we are in the embryonic stages of seeing developments in medical science on the benefits of various compounds that are found in the cannabis plant,&rdquo; explained Dr. Katz. &ldquo;The entire veterinary community, just like in human medicine, the first thing you learn in school are the three words &lsquo;do no harm.&rsquo; And they&rsquo;re not going to prescribe or recommend anything until they are completely satisfied that it is both safe and effective. They&rsquo;re just not there yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may not have all the &ldquo;white papers&rdquo; compiled from years of double-blind studies, peer-reviewed research and tried-and-true advice from lab-coat-wearing experts like we&rsquo;re used to, but for the open-minded the dreaded &ldquo;black box&rdquo; space is not a dead-end or unknown place to be feared. Rather, it is a new frontier to be explored for undiscovered treasures like a deeper knowledge and understanding of our bodies and how natural remedies work for both ourselves and our pets.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Richard S. Gubbe</h4>
<p>The old axiom of &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t beat &rsquo;em, join &rsquo;em,&rdquo; best describes Duke Rodriguez&rsquo;s vision for the future of medical cannabis. The president and CEO of Ultra Health, the largest cannabis operation in New Mexico, is utilizing long accepted delivery systems used by pharmaceutical companies and applying them to medical cannabis in his latest venture he says also will land in Nevada.</p>
<p>Rodriguez is partnering with an Israeli pharmaceutical company to provide the manufacturing and the research to showcase a new line of products debuting first in New Mexico, his base of operations. Israel is recognized as a key contributor of cannabis-related research while the U.S. allows only government-funded studies so it makes sense for Rodriguez to ally with progressive leaders in the cannabis field.</p>
<p>Rodriguez believes the key to mainstream acceptance is coat-tailing Big Pharma while bringing along solid research from Panaxia Ltd, a pro-cannabis pharmaceutical company based in Israel. "Since we established Panaxia in 2010, we constantly strive to bring the strictest protocols and most advanced technology available in the pharma industry to the production of our cannabis-based products. We believe that medical cannabis products should be developed and manufactured under the highest standards and quality assurance levels like any other pharmaceutical product,&rdquo; explained Dr. Dadi Segal of Panaxia.</p>
<p>Following a 14-month negotiation and due diligence process between the two companies, Panaxia will be providing smokeless proprietary cannabinoid dosage and treatment protocols not readily available in the United States. The partnership will allow Ultra Health to manufacture product delivery systems that include tablets, suppositories and inhalers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not &lsquo;smoke two joints and call me in the morning&rsquo;,&rdquo; Rodriguez told <em>elevate</em> of the pharmaceutical-like products. &ldquo;They look and feel and perform like normal products with less toxicity and side effects. They have been created in low production volume (in New Mexico) and will be more widely distributed in the middle of March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beneficial to chronic conditions requiring ongoing dosing such as PTSD, chronic pain, cancers, neuropathy pain, epilepsy, anorexia, and HIV/AIDS, the new smokeless-designed cannabis products will provide better delivery systems for patients and physicians with regard to both safety and dosage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the popularity to take root, you are going to have to be dose-specific and pharmaceutical,&rdquo; Rodriguez explained. &ldquo;Pharmacies will expect products more traditional. This will be the direction this is going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ultra Health&rsquo;s line of medical-grade cannabis products are exactly what pharmacies are used to and will include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="margin-left:50px">
<li>Sublingual tablets &ndash; sublingual tablets offer faster delivery as well as more efficient bioavailability compared to other smokeless ingestion. They are available in 5- and 10-milligram dosages in 30 count packets.</li>
<li>Rectal suppositories &ndash; suppositories allow for rapid absorption and less degradation of the product. This will be beneficial for patients vomiting or unable to swallow.</li>
<li>Vaginal suppositories &ndash; for topical, intravaginal delivery.</li>
<li>Oral spray inhalers &ndash; Inhalers are both convenient and deliver fast-acting relief. They provide a method of delivery that is dosage specific.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to offering familiar delivery methods, Rodriguez said they will follow precise dosing methods, &ldquo;When we say 10 milligrams of THC, we mean 10 milligrams of THC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new products will also address the movement in certain states, such as New York, to require physicians to make dosage-specific recommendations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The use of medical cannabinoids to treat a number of illnesses requires advanced pharmaceutical-grade products,&rdquo; Rodriguez said. &ldquo;The further expansion of approved medical conditions will make the demand for the newly developed Panaxia products especially helpful in the treatment of anticipated conditions, including diabetes, which disproportionately effects New Mexico&rsquo;s Native American and Hispanic populations, cardiovascular disease, opioid addiction and autism.&rdquo; Rodriguez told <em>elevate</em> there are also future plans to develop a pill for Alzheimer&rsquo;s patients.</p>
<p>Previous THC tablets offered by the pharmaceutical industry such as Marinol contain single-molecule synthetic offerings that medical cannabis advocates call limited and dangerous. Costs of synthetics are high and medical cannabis research suggests a full spectrum of cannabinoids is crucial to the healing process.</p>
<p>Rodriguez was in Las Vegas in February to speak to the Las Vegas Medical Marijuana Association and told industry participants there that recreational marijuana sales will not be the end of the medical side of the business. He also said that Nevada, with its stringent testing rules, will be a leader in the nation for how to run a program while supplying critical research to back up the claims that medical dispensing is a viable healthcare market. Research, credibility and delivery are keys to industry success, he said.</p>
<p>As for Ultra Health&rsquo;s future in Nevada, Rodiguez said a lab will be replicated in the Las Vegas area. Nevada is a target state for Rodriguez due to its medical cannabis potential and in order to comply with state law that restricts the origin and testing of products sold in the Silver State. &ldquo;A long as we have the prohibition of interstate commerce, we need a single lab in each state,&rdquo; Rodriguez told elevate. &ldquo;Until we develop a uniform cannabis act, we will have to be state specific.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even though state-specific operations are tedious, to be in multiple states is the best bet financially for cannabis businesses. It is estimated that the legal cannabis market will reach $21.8 billion in total annual sales by 2020, according to <em>The State of Legal Marijuana Markets</em> report compiled by Arcview Market Research last year. By comparison, at that point, the legal marijuana market could bring in more revenue than the National Football League, which produced $12 billion in 2015.</p>
<p>But it is not just cannabis&rsquo; potential for revenue, there&rsquo;s also a growing need. &ldquo;We have had numerous inquiries from dispensaries and major retail pharmacy outlets about having these products,&rdquo; Rodriguez said. &ldquo;It is important that we develop new products in anticipation of meeting the rapidly growing patient and provider demands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Considering how much Americans love taking pills, this is not just giving the people what they want but, more importantly, what they need.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the space of three days Dr. Kent Crowley developed the Trokie medicinal cannabis lozenge. Not familiar? Trokie, which is similar in appearance to a small square cough drop, is placed under the upper lip where it is left to dissolve through buccal absorption via the mucosal membranes lining the cheeks and absorbed into the blood. &ldquo;A quarter of a Trokie should take 45 minutes to an hour to dissolve, if you do it right,&rdquo; cautions Dr. Crowley, Pharm. D.</p>
<p>Calling it &ldquo;the most concentrated per unit of volume or weight of any product on the market,&rdquo; Dr. Crowley says Trokie&rsquo;s patented delivery system is considered the same as a tincture or a capsule. &ldquo;We discovered in this delivery system that it works on almost everybody and delivers a reliable and consistent dose of medical cannabis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once he had created Trokie in March 2014, it took Dr. Crowley three months to develop it into a commercial product and get it on shelves by that May. The alacrity at which Dr. Crowley developed the Trokie was for good reason. It was at the request of a friend who was trying to develop a solution for a 12-year-old girl suffering from intractable nausea. &ldquo;Looking at the data it was clear to me that the issue was how to get something into somebody who can&rsquo;t tolerate anything and do it as reliably as possible and avoid all the problems associated with the medical conditions and complex pharmacokinetics. I had several different quick solutions for the situation. After I looked at the complicated pharmacokinetics I thought the Trokie delivery was best,&rdquo; explains Dr. Crowley, director of research and development of Trokie products and future patents. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s really how it started because I didn&rsquo;t know a thing about cannabis at all, but I did know a whole lot about functional medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although a pain expert for over 20 years who co-owns two other patents, both in the neuropathic pain category, Dr. Crowley was not a cannabis proponent prior to developing Trokie. &ldquo;I thought it was a gateway drug. I had nothing to do with cannabis before 2014.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With 30 years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry and clinical medicine, Dr. Crowley quickly became a believer. &ldquo;Cannabis has blown me away -- its efficacy, safety and the outcomes we have seen where nothing else has worked,&rdquo; says Dr. Crowley. &ldquo;Coming from a functional medicine background, cannabis is probably the most important tool I have gotten to add to my toolbox to help people with their healthcare goals or managing their disease states in the last 10 years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crowley also sees the value of cannabis for contending with the nation&rsquo;s opiate crisis. &ldquo;We have an opiate epidemic and we have a tool that works, it doesn&rsquo;t complicate the symptoms, side effects or risk of opiate use, it improves the quality of life and pain scale. There is no downside, we have seen a 25 percent reduction in overdose death in any state that has cannabis in it, and we have the National Academy of Sciences saying the evidence is unequivocal that cannabis works for chronic pain in adults.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Crowley and his team have been collecting data to see how Trokie helps opiate abusers. He notes that &ldquo;we saw an 85 percent reduction across the board. In as short as 30 days, some of our study participants were weaning themselves off opiates on their own. Six out of 42 patients came off opiates entirely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Compounding pharmacy is the technique Dr. Crowley used to make all of the products in the Trokie portfolio which includes a suppository, capsule, topical, and this month a pain patch will be introduced.</p>
<p>Dr. Crowley has made cannabis the focus of his work because &ldquo;what I am seeing using cannabis is that you are able to give the body something it needs and can work with in order to fix it. And that isn&rsquo;t what happens a lot with traditional medication that we use.&rdquo;</p>

		<title>DO DISCOUNTS DESTROY YOUR BUSINESS?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Mark S.A. Smith</h4>

<p>Must you offer discounts to get customers to buy? Many retailers believe that if they don&rsquo;t offer a better price, the customer will choose their competitor. That&rsquo;s not necessarily true. The problem with discounts is customers come to expect them and they usually want an even better deal the next time. It becomes a price race to the bottom.</p>
<p>Valid reasons for discounting include stealing a deal away from a competitor, increasing the value of that customer&rsquo;s relationship with you, or increasing sales volume to generate needed cash flow or to take advantage of production efficiencies. Read on to learn how you can increase sales while decreasing discounts.</p>

<p><strong>Smart Pricing</strong></p>
<p>When everybody sells the same branded product, customers tend to comparison shop because in the absence of product differentiation, price becomes the differentiator. When everybody knows the price of the product, the price must be right.</p>
<p>When selling a widely-available brand, choose to use &ldquo;smart pricing&rdquo; where you consistently sell that product at a competitive price. Customers assume that the rest of your prices are equally competitive. Upsell the customer to a better or higher-value product and sell other products they don&rsquo;t know at higher margins.</p>

<p><strong>Sweeten the Deal</strong></p>
<p>Hold your price firm and add value. What can you throw in that sweetens the deal, adds value, and helps you move overstock?</p>
<p>A good deal sweetener can be something your customer hasn&rsquo;t bought before, such as a new strain, a new accessory, or a new edible. You get the double benefit of today&rsquo;s sale plus setting up the next purchase. Cosmetic companies constantly do this, never discounting, instead offering samples of what the customer should buy next.</p>
<p>Throw in overstock. You get to move old inventory and keep the full margin on the leading product. Don&rsquo;t toss in anything scarce, costs you lots to deliver, or is of high value to your customer. There&rsquo;s no reason to discount things people want or that are in high demand.</p>
<p>Make sure that your customer knows the full price of what you&rsquo;re adding to sweeten the deal so that they understand the value they&rsquo;re getting.</p>

<p><strong>Bundle Up</strong></p>
<p>Offer a better deal on a bundle then on individual items. What do they need for a complete experience? Bundle it in. Bundles take the focus off individual item prices, increase the sale size, and upgrade the customer&rsquo;s received value, so everyone wins.</p>
<p>This works well when you can bundle in a higher-margin product, such as custom smoking accessories, and increase the overall bundle profit.</p>

<p><strong>Credit for Next Purchase</strong></p>
<p>Offer customers a credit on their next purchase. This method holds the price today and offers a reward when they return.</p>
<p>You can also use this to sell more, with a sliding credit scale based on purchase volume. &ldquo;When you buy today, you&rsquo;ll earn a $5 credit you can use anytime other than today. And if you buy $200 today, that increases to a $20 credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The customer feels like they&rsquo;re getting a deal without impacting the perceived price and associated value, and impacting your margin. Ultimately you only forgo the <br /> profit on the credit and keep all of your margin today. You can consider this your marketing investment for them to return, soon.</p>
<p>Put an expiration date on the credit so that your customer will purchase sooner than later, adding to your short-term sales volume.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Nine years ago Dr. Bonni Goldstein took a leave of absence from practicing as a pediatric emergency medicine doctor. During her break she researched medical cannabis for a friend who had cancer and “was surprised to learn that there were a number of studies on the subject and researchers had discovered the endocannabinoid system, a major system in our bodies that wasn’t part of my medical school or residency curriculum. Intrigued, I started working in a cannabis clinician’s office in Long Beach, California. It was really eye opening and I haven’t looked back since,” said Goldstein, who became an author last fall when her book “Cannabis Revealed” was published.

Nine years ago I took a leave of absence from practicing as a pediatric emergency medicine doctor because the hours were driving me crazy and I had also just had a child. So I took a leave of absence to recalibrate and get some sleep because ER medicine often includes lots of graveyard and swing shifts and I was getting a little burned out. I had taken some time off with the intention of going back. During the time off, a friend of mine was sick and had me asked about medicinal cannabis and I was ignorant about it. I started looking into it for her and started to read about it online. I was not against cannabis in general but it was not on my radar so I started to read about it. Specifically because she had cancer I started reading about that in particular. I was really surprised to see that there were a vast number of studies and that they had discovered this system called the endocannabinoid system in the late ‘80s early ‘90s, which is a major system in our bodies that I didn’t learn about in medical school and it wasn’t taught to me during my residency and I had never heard of it so I found that quite curious. I started to do my research and I was really intrigued by it. I really didn’t want to go back to ER medicine so I started to work in a cannabis clinician’s office in Long Beach, California. It was really eye opening and I haven’t looked back since.

<div class="panel-body">

? I started working at a medical cannabis practice in 2008 and then in 2011 I bought it. My practice is 75 percent adults and 25 percent children. What struck me after spending a month working in this office is that these were all real patients. Again, I shouldn’t have been shocked, but I was. They were just everyday normal people, the same people that show up in an ER or any other doctor’s office. They had been diagnosed with some condition that is either not responding to treatment or they are trying a treatment and it’s intolerable. We all know that not every medicine works for every single person and we also know some people get bad side effects from medicine. That was the usual case, in fact that was probably 90 percent of patients, people who had already tried conventional treatment and were just reluctant to continue because it just isn’t working out.

<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I have been treating patients with cannabis for almost nine years and in the last two years I have had more referrals from physicians than I have ever had in all the years before combined. There’s no question in my mind doctors are starting to listen to their patients and their patients are saying I started using medical cannabis and it’s really helping me. Patients no longer need that prescription for opiates or Xanax anymore and they want to get off x, y and z medications because they are feeling so much better using cannabis.

</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I think because it’s been in the media. Patients are feeling a little more comfortable bringing it up to their doctors because how else do you tell your doctor you don’t need that prescription anymore. I think part of it also is the adult-use passage of marijuana in California and advances in Colorado and Washington state. Patients are seeing lots of shows on TV like “Vice” and seeing the people on the shows have similar diagnoses to theirs. So the fact that it has been in the media and doctors are seeing that as citizens, so to speak, but also they are hearing it in their offices.

If you are a compassionate kind doctor, and I believe most doctors are, you may have poo-pooed it in the past but now they are hearing it from more than one patient. They are hearing it from the little old lady who comes every month, or a patient they have been working really hard to figure out some kind of solution for. Doctors are partners with their patients trying to find good health for them and now they are coming back to them saying, ‘Hey this is really working.’ If you are a compassionate physician than you are listening and saying there must be something to this because this person is not an abuser of medication, this person is a reasonable patient who I have known for years and now they are telling me this is working, maybe there is something to this.

<div class="panel-body">

I went to a few conferences and the internet is chock full of information. Anybody and everybody can go on Google Scholar and type in cannabinoid receptor or cannabis therapy and it lists all the scientific articles. You can educate yourself, you don’t need to have access to a medical library to find the studies. They are right there on the internet. There’s a huge amount of research coming out of other countries, they have restrictions but they are allowing their scientists to do research. Our Schedule 1 status in the U.S. prohibits us from doing research on the benefits of cannabis. Just recently the DEA did say they were going to open up cannabis to be researched. However, there are still a fair amount of legal barriers to research. You have to do a ton of paperwork and jump through 10 hoops in order to get access to cannabis.

Why do some people respond to cannabis and others do not?

<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

What’s fascinating is that the way people respond to cannabis medicine is unique. Two people with the same condition have different endocannabinoid systems and, therefore, a different way of responding to cannabis. I have some children who have come into my practice with intractable epilepsy who can become seizure-free from the first dose of CBD-rich cannabis. Other children with the same exact diagnosis don’t respond at all. Part of that is the understanding that your endocannabinoid system is coded in your DNA and the way that cannabis interacts with that is as unique to you as your fingerprints. So why is that some patients respond and some don’t? Just like anything in medicine, there are people who respond really well and then there is the kind of middle of the road responder and those that don’t respond at all.

<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Often when the media does a story, the b-roll behind the news story is someone smoking a joint and they are talking about medical cannabis. There are some patients who might do that but the majority are not. I have so many adult patients who will see a pediatric patient in my waiting room and ask how do they take it. They take it just like they take their other medicine, as a liquid in their mouth. I mean how else would they take it? How do children take medicine in general? We have all seen liquid Tylenol, antibiotics that come in a bottle, mom pours it into a teaspoon and puts it in a child’s mouth. So this media reinforcement that people are smoking pot trains people to think our kids are smoking pot, which could not be further from the truth.

</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I try to educate people that right now you can walk into any dispensary or collective in California and there will be unlabeled/untested cannabis either in raw form or as products that just has a little label on it with the company’s name and the type of strain. Then there are formulations with all the testing such as the CBD, THC amounts, pesticide testing, additives, solvents, etc. This is medicine. I need to know that when somebody is using cannabis, they are using a safe and tested product. That’s something a lot of people don’t realize. If you find something that works, you want it to be available to you the next month and the month after that. If you find something that stops your child’s seizures, the last thing you want to do is show up the next month to buy another bottle and they don’t have it anymore. That is not okay because these kids may be weaning off other medications and that could be catastrophic for a child and certainly for an adult.

I met with an attorney when I first thought about doing this. We went over all the documents and the medical board guidelines. We went through the law and he told me how to practice medicine doing this, which is the same way I practiced medicine prior. You follow the guidelines and follow the standard of care.

<div class="panel-body">

There are a lot of patients who know nothing about cannabis. They have read about it and spent a little bit of time online researching it. It’s mostly people who are not using cannabis who want education and understanding and guidance from a physician. That is who I am seeing in my practice. When you walk into a dispensary these days to get medicine there is such a wide array of products that it can be completely and totally overwhelming. If it works for you and is keeping you off toxic medicine, I think you should have access. We have to get away from the stigma that people are potheads just because they use cannabis. Just because it’s available doesn’t mean you abuse it.

I wrote it because my patients were saying to me you are giving me an education but it’s a lot of information and I am going to forget most of it when I walk out of here. They wanted to know where they could go to get more information. There’s a chapter on the endocannabinoid system, a chapter on the plant, and the makeup of the plant, there are patient stories, and a chapter on how to use cannabis medicine, a chapter on how products are labeled and what you might be looking for if you want CBD-rich medicine. I took the education that I give to my patients and just put it in the book so somebody could reference and digest it in a way that makes sense.

Do you ever get any pushback about treating children with cannabis?

<div id="collapseThirteen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

There were some doctors who called me and said why are you seeing my patient? Don’t you know how sick this child is? That was somewhat difficult. For a parent to bring their child to my office and consider medical cannabis is not a cavalier decision. These children have years of failed treatment and have taken more medicine than any adult takes and have a severe disability in their life. 
But now there are neurologists all around LA who are referring patients to me and telling their patients if you are going to do it, go to somebody who knows what they are doing. Also, they are telling parents that it’s okay to try this, that maybe all the other options have been exhausted. There are children being recommended to have brain surgery but without a guarantee that it will help and its irreversible and, if you ask me, very aggressive. I am not against it if there is a chance it’s going to work, but why wouldn’t you try a plant medicine that’s non-toxic and, for all you know, may work.

<div class="panel-body">

We don’t really know. Cannabis is anti-inflammatory, the compounds in cannabis are antioxidants -- this is proven documented research. The compounds in cannabis have been shown in laboratory studies to kill cancer cells. It is quite possible that cannabis can be used as preventative medicine but without being able to study which compounds in what ratios, how often to take it, how much to take, what method is the best way to ingest -- all these questions will remain. I hope it will be a focus of research.

What are the downsides of cannabis? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFifteen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

One of the things doctors say to me is we don’t know the long-term side effects of cannabis. And I agree. We have not been allowed to study the long-term side effects. But when I have a child at the age of nine who was not reading or writing but is now and is on significantly less seizure medication and just on cannabis oil, I will tell you that this is forward developmental progression not regression. The long-term side effects do not look grim, they actually look pretty good, they look like beneficial side effects. 
I don’t want to sell false hope, we don’t know who is going to respond. I tell parents there are no guarantees, your child may or may not respond. But this is a process, you have to be willing to really sort it out, it’s a matter of finding the right oil that works. Or patients might not become seizure-free but may they have a 90 percent reduction of seizures. That means one seizure a week for some kids or one seizure a month for some kids. What parents are seeing is their children’s brain is progressing forward.

What would tell a physician who is hesitant to get involved with cannabis?  
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSixteen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

First, I would tell them to educate themselves, learn about the endocannbinoid system and the role it plays in human health and disease. I would also tell them the same thing I would tell any doctor who is going into the field of medicine, be compassionate to your patient’s experience but practice medicine in a responsible way. Treat medical cannabis as something that it is, which is different than a single molecule pharmaceutical because it is different, it’s a plant, it’s not a single molecule medicine. At the same time, educate your patients about it and have an understanding yourself and be able to educate yourself about it. Be a partner with your patients so you can help them find what works. 
In my book, I tell readers you are not allowed to have an opinion about medical cannabis unless you know what the endocannabinoid system is. But we are still taught in medical school that this is a drug of abuse and we leave medical school and go into our residency saying people who use cannabis are abusing marijuana and that is not true. Many of them are using it as their medicine and as their doctors we owe it to them to know the science.

What has been your most fascinating cannabis discovery to date?  
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeventeen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Dr. Vincenzo Di Marzo is a prolific and brilliant cannabis researcher in Italy who has written many papers and he wrote a sentence that many cannabis doctors include in discussions with patients: “The endocannabinoid system is essential to life, and it relates messages that affect how we relax, eat, sleep, forget and protect.” He really summed it up in that sentence. Patients really identify with that quote and see themselves in it. To me that’s fascinating, that there is this underlying system that if we can get it into balance it will allow patients to be in control of their pain, to allow them to flip that power from their condition controlling them and ruining their lives. To now have control of their condition and be in charge is so powerful for patients and life changing for many of them. 
One story in my book is about a girl who has severe intractable epilepsy. She was having so many seizures she couldn’t go to school anymore. With cannabis treatment, she’s back in school. How do you deny a child a chance? I’m not saying it’s going to work but the option has to be there and doctors have to accept that sometimes we have to think outside of the box. She’s not seizure free but she is able to go to school, she is able to learn. Reaching her full potential while on multiple drugs that affect a developing brain was very difficult.
I have another story of a wonderful family who came to me with a child who had seizures for many years. He was on a number of medications and was being worked up as a possible candidate for brain surgery. They came to see me a number of years ago and he was on a number of medications which is always a concern when we are adding in cannabis because of drug interactions. Mom was just doing her research, and she wanted to know if I thought her son would respond but, meanwhile, they were going through this workup for him to have brain surgery. But the approval process was taking forever so I said let’s just try some CBD oil and see what happens while this is delayed. He has now been seizure-free for a year and he didn’t have to have brain surgery.
I have another young man who I am taking care of who was having a grand mal seizure every five to seven days despite multiple medications. He was told by his pediatric neurologist his seizures would likely not respond to cannabis oil. But his parents pursued it anyway because nothing was working. So they came to me somewhat skeptical because their doctor said it wouldn’t work but they were willing to try it because they were moving into the drugs that really have significant side effects. I started seeing him in August and right after Christmas he went weeks without a seizure, and would have a breakthrough seizure here and there, but now he is three months seizure-free.

What emerging trends do you foresee for medicinal cannabis?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEighteen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Raw cannabinoids are proving to have some medicinal value. I am seeing some really nice results from raw cannabinoids and, interestingly, at lower doses they are not psychoactive. You don’t have to worry about a psychoactive effect so that allows you to still drive your car and participate in your life without feeling high. I am seeing some nice results for epilepsy, inflammatory conditions, IBS, even autism with a low dose of raw cannabinoid preparations. They have to be taken raw and are ingested through juicing or smoothies, which is very difficult for most people because access to fresh, raw plant is hard. A number of cannabis suppliers in California are making a cold extracted cannabis oil that contains raw cannabinoids.
The packaging on medical cannabis products is starting to look more like pharmaceutical medicine, meaning there’s a description of what’s in the medicine, how it is grown, the cannabinoid makeup, how much THC, CBD, and raw cannabinoids are in it. But also listed are terpenoids, the essential oils in the plant that provide some medicinal value, and how they work synergistically with cannabinoids. When you have something that is unlabeled it’s a roll of the dice, but wouldn’t it be nice to know as a patient which cannabinoids are working for you and which terpenoids are helping you? Cannabis suppliers are starting to understand that people want information about their medicine.

<h2>WYOMING</h2>
Rep. Mark Baker (R-Sweetwater) and a bipartisan group of legislators has introduced a new bill, HB 157, that would eliminate criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana. HB 157 would apply to up to three ounces of cannabis or marijuana products (such as edibles) containing 500 milligrams or less of THC. Under current Wyoming law, possession of even a tiny amount of marijuana carries a penalty of up to one year of incarceration and a fine of up to $1,000. Rep. Baker’s bill would reduce the penalty to a civil fine of up to $200.

<h2>KENTUCKY</h2>
Senator Perry Clark has introduced two bills that would overhaul marijuana policies. SB 57 would make medical marijuana legal for seriously ill Kentuckians, and SB 72 would legalize marijuana for adult use and create a regulated and taxed system. SB 57 would protect qualifying patients from arrest and allow them to cultivate marijuana plants. It would also allow them to obtain medical marijuana from dispensaries, which would be regulated by the state. SB 72 would take Kentucky in the direction of the eight states that have voted to legalize and regulate marijuana for adult use.

<h2>VIRGINIA</h2>
Representative Joe Moody (D-El Paso), former prosecutor and the current Vice Chairman of the Criminal Jurisprudence Committee, has filed a marijuana-related bill for the upcoming legislative session. Rep. Moody introduced HB 81, which would replace possible arrests and jail time with a civil fine for low-level possession of marijuana. The bill, which is co-sponsored by Rep. Jason Isaac (R-Dripping Springs), would make possession of one ounce or less of marijuana a non-criminal offense punishable by a fine of $250. Under current law, possession of two ounces or less is a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to a $2,000 fine and 180 days in jail. Senator Jose Rodríguez, also of El Paso, introduced a Senate companion bill, SB 170.

<h2>MAINE</h2>
A voter-approved initiative to end marijuana prohibition in Maine became official on January 30th, making it legal for adults 21 and older to possess and grow limited amounts of marijuana. Under Question 1, which voters approved in November, adults 21 years of age and older can legally possess up to two-and-a-half ounces of marijuana, grow up to six flowering marijuana plants and 12 non-flowering plants, and possess the marijuana harvested from those plants inside their residence. It will remain illegal to use marijuana in public or to drive while impaired by marijuana. The law will not affect employers’ drug-testing policies or their rights to prohibit marijuana use by employees. The legislature is in the process of establishing a regulated system of marijuana cultivation and sales, which is currently scheduled to go into effect by February 1, 2018.

<h2>MARYLAND</h2>
In early February, two companion bills that would legalize and regulate personal use amounts of cannabis for adults 21 and up were introduced in the Maryland State Senate. SB 928 would allow adults to possess up to one ounce of cannabis and to grow up to six plants, and would set up regulated businesses that would cultivate, process, and sell cannabis, including a “craft cultivator” category for small businesses. SB 927 sets a $30 per ounce excise tax and 9% sales tax (the same as alcohol). Half of the proceeds would go to high-poverty schools.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dustin Shroyer, COO of Revolution Enterprises based in Chicago, Illinois, has been a legal cannabis grower in Colorado since 2006. He has worked as a dispensary owner, lead grower, and consultant in the cannabis industry.<br /> <br /> <h3>How did you get started in the cannabis industry?<br /> </h3>I started off as a wholesale grower in Colorado back in 2006 when I saw the industry taking off. The law stated that only dispensaries could sell cannabis legally, so I started a small, wholesale dispensary. I ran it until late 2012 then I moved on because I wanted to do something bigger.</p>
<p>I consulted for a few years, winning cultivation licenses for clients in every state I could. During that time I learned about the Illinois market. Colorado cannabis was heavily contaminated with pesticides, and I wanted to produce clean product on an even playing field.</p>
<p>I eventually met a team capable of building a company I could get behind. We started Revolution, one of the biggest national cannabis companies out there. We combined our knowledge of how to make quality cannabis into a name-worthy brand.</p>
<h3>Tell our readers about Revolution Enterprises.<br /> </h3><p>We oversee two growing licenses in Illinois that allow a total of 150,000 square feet of space. We do everything under one roof: cultivation, propagation, flowering, breeding, genetics, and laboratory work. We&rsquo;re currently growing about 10,000 plants, and despite being a large company, we do everything by hand, boutique-style. <br /> We grow completely indoors. We&rsquo;re not opposed to other methods of cultivation, and they have their place, but we believe the best way to achieve high-quality flower is indoor cultivation. <br /> We also have a full lab setup. Our lab produces shatter, live resin, nutraceuticals, sublingual spray, and everything related to vapor cartridges. We even distill our own terpenes for our vapor cartridges. Best of all, everything is 100 percent pesticide-free.</p>
<h3>What kind of rooms do you have?<br /> </h3><p>Between the two facilities, we have a variety of rooms, including agricultural laboratories. Each facility has identical rooms: Propagative and vegetative rooms with multiple tiers to conserve space, large free-flowering rooms, and two mother rooms to store genetics.</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s your growing methodology?<br /> </h3><p>We grow via a bioponic method using organic-based nutrients in a semi-soil mix with a light substrate. The substrate we use contains dried compost which comes back to life when watered with a top-drip system. The compost tea we grow with adds a lot of microbial life and a large amount of carbon.</p>
<p>We currently run 400 lights and have 50 different strains. We prefer somewhat diffused lighting over direct lighting because we want the cola to receive light from all angles, rather than just straight down. Right now we use a full-spectrum T5 fluorescent light for propagation and a DE blue-spectrum MH for veg.</p>
<p>We use environmental controls designed for data centers, allowing us to control the environment down to single minute increments. Every door has a monitor outside of it that reads environmental data. At any time I can look at a room&rsquo;s environmental data down to the minute for the last six months.</p>
<h3>How do you manage pests?<br /> </h3><p>We have tight biosecurity controls for our employees. Our growers have to walk through five doors in the facility before they ever enter a grow room. They scrub in, change their clothes, put on their work uniform, and change their shoes, which prevents a lot of outside contamination.<br /> Certain problems like spider mites or powdery mildew cannot be allowed in whatsoever, but some &ldquo;pests&rdquo; can be used to benefit your plants, as long as they don&rsquo;t reach a certain threshold where they start chewing on your roots. They can be kept under control with natural solutions like diatomaceous earth and other methods.</p>
<h3>What are your biggest challenges and successes?<br /> </h3><p>The biggest challenge I faced was coming online in 2010 and starting a 100 percent organic brand. My competition was willing to use PGRs, poisonous pesticides, and other unhealthy methods. It&rsquo;s a struggle to deliver something healthy to people without turning them off on price. <br /> My biggest success has been the creation of a scalable value chain. I&rsquo;m elated with what we&rsquo;re doing right now and our current menu -- only 12 months into operation and we&rsquo;re producing cannabis on par with the best in the world.</p>
<h3>What advice do you have for new commercial growers?<br /> </h3><p>--Stick to the basics. When you&rsquo;re in the cannabis industry, you have 100 problems all the time and you&rsquo;re always problem-solving. Your number one goal is solving problems. <br /> --Don&rsquo;t overthink it. Don&rsquo;t solve problems that aren&rsquo;t there. By fixing a problem that doesn&rsquo;t exist, you&rsquo;re creating a new problem and exacerbating a problem that already exists. Now you have more problems because you fixed the wrong problem. You get an exponential increase in problems. You need to stick to the basics.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Making Concentrates with Tasia Mercadente</strong></p>
<p>In this month&rsquo;s Growers Network Spotlight the focus is on Tasia Mercadente, who runs <a href="https://www.instagram.com/santiagoandunbar/">Santiago and Dunbar Extracts</a> in Arizona. She performs many extractions, producing a wide variety of concentrates, including waxes, crumbles, shatters, and oils. Since learning about cannabis as a teenager, Mercadente has pursued it, forming a company and focusing her career on extractions for both recreational and medicinal users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Growers Network:</strong> Why make concentrates?</p>
<p><strong>Tasia Mercadente:</strong> I got into making cannabis extracts to help cancer patients, which started because of my best friend. He had to get a testicle and a hernia removed out of the same region. I started giving him CBD and high potency THC capsules. He&rsquo;s taking them every day now, and they&rsquo;re really helping him with the pain and some other symptoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GN:</strong> What concentrates do you make?</p>
<p><strong>TM:</strong> I make live resin, shatter, and crumble extracts. Crumble is like a cookie crumble. It breaks apart really easily into a dust. It&rsquo;s stable, but crumbly and not gooey at all.</p>
<p>Live resin starts by freezing flower. When you take a cannabis plant down, you immediately put it in a cryogenic freezer. After it&rsquo;s frozen, you blast it with butane. Live resin should be a little bit gooey. It should be stable, but moldable, like pottery before it&rsquo;s fired.</p>
<p>Shatter has the consistency of glass. It&rsquo;ll break easily. People prefer it to be a transparent gold color because that shows how clean it is. Some of the darker kinds can have more THC, but aren&rsquo;t as good. My Bubba Skywalker turns out a blonde shatter, without fail, at 72.63% THC. My God&rsquo;s Gift produces a dark, amber color shatter at 77.92% THC. The dark amber color is seen as less desirable, despite the higher concentration of THC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GN:</strong> Is there a predictably to making extracts?</p>
<p><strong>TM:</strong> Whenever you put something new in, you don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re going to get out. If I run trim from some unknown place, I wouldn&rsquo;t know what kind or amount of product I would get. I also don&rsquo;t find out until the next day because I run a 12-hour purge in the vacuum oven. Luckily, I know how to take that product a step further. I can throw it in a rotary evaporator, distill it, make tinctures with it, or something else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GN:</strong> What do you try to avoid when performing extractions?</p>
<p><strong>TM:</strong> I try to avoid blowing myself up. When you&rsquo;re blasting, you&rsquo;re unleashing a ton of highly flammable butane into the air. It can blow it up if you blast in a non-ventilated area. Generally speaking, closed-loop systems are safer than open-air blasting because they cycle the butane via tubes into another tank, preventing significant oxygen exposure. This is why you sometimes hear about cannabis grows blowing up. Somebody was not taking appropriate safety precautions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GN:</strong> What equipment do you use for extractions?</p>
<p><strong>TM:</strong> I use a closed-loop butane extractor for my BHOs, and Everclear alcohol for my tinctures and edibles. My policy is that if you&rsquo;re going to ingest it, it should be an edible product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For purification, I use a couple of things. I&rsquo;ve already mentioned <a href="http://ss1.us/a/6Oyxe2vr">rotary evaporators</a> to remove solvents. I also use <a href="http://ss1.us/a/2gtwR3Ek">vacuum ovens</a> as one of my key components in purification. We also have a custom distillation apparatus setup. The rest is just standard laboratory equipment &mdash; beakers, flasks, test tubes, racks, the works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GN: </strong>What&rsquo;s your extraction procedure?<strong><br /> TM: </strong>First, a safety check. Make sure all your valves are closed and the area is free of flammable materials and physical hazards. Clear the space and all distractions. Second is blasting. Blast the flower in the tube with butane until nothing is coming out of the flower tube. This requires a lot of focus. You need to understand which valves to open and close and what pressure you&rsquo;re working with. Third is purification. I purge the butane by fonduing the mixture in a bowl-shaped boat floating on hot water. Afterwards, I put the boat into a vacuum oven for 12 hours and come back the next day. I set my vacuum oven temperature based on a chart I found some time ago, detailing the different cannabinoids and compounds you can extract.</p>

		<title>SOLVING THE CONUNDRUM OF PUBLIC CANNABIS CONSUMPTION</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As more states pass adult-use cannabis laws, public consumption of cannabis is increasingly becoming an issue. Nevada&rsquo;s elected officials have been trying to tackle it on several fronts since Nevada residents voted to pass adult-use cannabis in November,</p>
<p>In early March, Senator Tick Segerblom, D-Las Vegas, introduced SB 236, which would allow local governments to issue licenses for public marijuana use. Meanwhile the Clark County Commission, which has jurisdiction over the Las Vegas Strip and outlying areas, has appointed a 14-member Green Ribbon Marijuana Advisory group to help determine an optimal way for consumption lounges to be implemented. The proposed model introduced at the panel&rsquo;s first meeting held on March 27 calls for a one-year pilot program that would allow medical marijuana dispensaries to test the idea of public consumption inside their shops.</p>
<p>While the governments&rsquo; machinations for developing a consumption model continue, a panel of industry leaders, varying from law enforcement to companies in the cannabis and nightlife space, assembled at yesterday&rsquo;s Nightclub &amp; Bar Convention and Trade Show held at the Las Vegas Convention Center to discuss the future of consumption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to be able to consume this substance somewhere just like alcohol is in bars and clubs,&rdquo; said panel moderator Ricardo Baca, contributing editor to <em>The Cannabist</em>, who started the discussion by noting that &ldquo;public consumption or social use has kind of become a bad word in Colorado lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sherriff Joe DiSalvo of Colorado&rsquo;s Pitkin County, which encompasses the town of Aspen, noted Colorado has been in this position before. Making a comparison between cannabis consumption and the popularity of snowboarding in the &lsquo;80s, he said, &ldquo;Skiing companies did not allow snowboarding on its mountains when it first became popular. So what we have to that is similar, meaning if you came to Aspen, Colorado in 1987 and went to a retail snowboard shop and spent $2000 on snowboard gear, you would walk out on the street and there would be no place to use it. So you have just spent this money with no place to use the equipment. That&rsquo;s where we are today with cannabis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no public consumption, you can&rsquo;t smoke or vaporize in hotel rooms. We are selling $9 million dollars&rsquo; worth of cannabis a year in our small community and not giving visitors a place to use it safely with some guidance and educational components to it. So now we have this problem of where people can recreate with cannabis. I think that&rsquo;s what our next step is -- a cannabis club or something along those lines makes sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Currently, Colorado law allows cannabis to be consumed legally in a private home with the owners&rsquo; knowledge. But Baca pointed out that Denver&rsquo;s residents just &ldquo;overwhelmingly passed the world&rsquo;s first consumption license. The state liquor board has come out and outlawed no dual use as an option; if you have a liquor license you cannot have on-site cannabis consumption that will be illegal. But soon there will be coffee shops, art galleries and movie theaters that are 420-friendly in the city of Denver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are really starting to see a shift in the way people embrace marijuana,&rdquo; said Tripp Keber, CEO of Dixie Brands, an edible company operating in seven states, who noted nothing really bad has happened in Colorado since the state went rec in 2014 or in Washington and Oregon when they, too, voted to make adult-use legal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Keber may be sensing a shift in Western states, Nevada&rsquo;s gaming establishments are a little further away from embracing consumption. Evan Marder, founder and CEO of Matrix NV, a cultivation and production facility in Las Vegas, is not so bullish. He thinks it will be some time before we see cannabis in bars or restaurants where liquor is served, noting studies need to be performed to see what the liabilities would be. &ldquo;But I think, in Las Vegas, we will get there. I think the interest is there. Entrepreneurs, nightclub owners and restaurateurs are interested in cannabis but, again, mixing with alcohol at this point, I don&rsquo;t see it happening right away. It&rsquo;s going to take years before you really start to see it mixed together, especially in the casinos here in Nevada.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Explaining he is not a big fan of mixed use, DiSalvo told the audience that, &ldquo;Alcohol is going to give marijuana a bad name. When you mix the use I think that people, at least from what I am seeing, are realizing there is a safer alternative that might not be alcohol. I feel pretty strongly that we should not mix the uses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although nobody is championing mixed use, it is happening, members of the panel noted. Baca interjected that it is &ldquo;sneaking in, it&rsquo;s just not above board for the most part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keber cited that in 2015, according to Colorado&rsquo;s Department of Revenue, $200 million dollars of $996 million in the state&rsquo;s cannabis revenue was directly attributed to cannabis tourism. Noting people are already using cannabis in nightclubs, in most cases illegally, &ldquo;we must find a way for these two industries to intersect and hopefully complement each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fundamentally believe people using cannabis are generally consuming less alcohol. I own nightclubs and I was starting to see that in 2008 and 2009 but that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean it&rsquo;s going to be detrimental to your business,&rdquo; said Keber. &ldquo;We absolutely have to find a way that these two industries are going to complement one another because it&rsquo;s not likely going to go away as more and more people are embracing cannabis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freddie Wyatt, president of Munch &amp; Company, a cannabis hospitality group, noted nightclub owners are the perfect entrepreneurs to step into the space because they are used to dealing with people in altered states. &ldquo;Having a cannabis club next door to your lounge or nightclub and actually have them as two different divisions so that you can essentially go between the two rooms makes sense. That&rsquo;s kind of the Amsterdam model -- you have the coffee shop and then the bar next door, which gives the consumer the responsibility. As proprietors we do have to be responsible for the tips, training, and not over-serve somebody. We have to figure out how to make this safe.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the future of how the hospitality industry will incorporate cannabis, Wyatt offered some big ideas. He envisions hotel minibars for cannabis will be set up just like they are for alcohol. &ldquo;There will be single joints, grinders, bongs, pipes...you will have an entire delivery service of what you would have with alcohol -- and think of the munchies,&rdquo; he enthused. &ldquo;And that will just be in your room because we are talking about private consumption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slowly but surely it will spread to outdoor events like pool parties at Hakkasan. It&rsquo;s already happening, you are just putting it into perspective. You are going to have cannabis restaurants, smoothie joints, nightclubs, lounges, hookah places -- that&rsquo;s where this is headed. It will be an entire industry by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marder agreed with Wyatt predicting it will happen in the next five, ten or 15 years. &ldquo;Colorado has been the launch pad but Las Vegas will become the catalyst for it; becoming the Amsterdam of the West. I think that once the casinos are able to embrace it -- they are pretty well set up to handle it with their air filtration systems, which will be a necessity -- I feel Las Vegas will really take it and run with it in a big way. Las Vegas will become a massive destination for cannabis in addition to everything else Vegas has to offer. And what better to go with entertainment, food and nightclubs than cannabis? There&rsquo;s really nothing in my mind that can beat that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keber believes Big Alcohol, Big Tobacco or even a major nightclub group that wants to possess, own, and distribute brands associated with cannabinoids will become the future employer of cannabis. &ldquo;I fundamentally believe the future of cannabis is going to be infused products. I think there is going to be an easy way to intersect our businesses both with the bar and nightclub industry with the cannabis industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DiSalvo sees cannabis&rsquo; future a bit differently than the rest of his fellow cannabis panelists &ndash; looking through the lens of public safety. &ldquo;I would like to see us make some different moves than we made with alcohol. We have to treat this as a brand-new product. The education must be at a very high level. I think that clubs are the future for that, a place where people can go get educated and use the product safely to learn more about it before they use it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even in my small community, the stigma that still goes with this product is off the charts. When people smell it in downtown Aspen there is usually a comment or a crack that our state doesn&rsquo;t want to be known as the Amsterdam of the West, yet, we provide no place for people to go and do this outside of the view of children or people who are visitors of our town. I would like to see education of product safety to make this succeed even more. I would really like to get a lot more information out on the CBD component of this. I think the non-psychoactive part of this medicine is going to be off the charts. And that&rsquo;s where I would like to see the future go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for Baca, he looked into his crystal ball and noted that &ldquo;the future is now. I just hosted a $300-a-plate dinner that was five courses and was paired with a cannabis flower, extract, or an edible. A lot of these new entrepreneurs who are taking the 420 event to the next level are being very professional about it, accounting for your shuttle to and from these beautiful farms for the farm-to-table dinners. These people are respectful and aware that this is an intoxicant as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although cannabis is an intoxicant, several panelists noted it has not been a detriment to the states that now have adult-use cannabis. &ldquo;All teen monthly use figures have remained static in every legal recreational market so far. Granted, we need another seven or eight years of data before we know more but the health stuff is looking good,&rdquo; offered Baca.</p>
<p>DiSalvo concurred, concluding, &ldquo;Our climate has not turned into Swiss cheese; our moral climate has not deteriorated. I think we are seeing that our state is thriving terrifically and all of the fear and loathing that went around it before Amendment 64 passed has basically evaporated.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>COLORADO</h2>
The Colorado Department of Revenue announced that $1.3 billion in regulated marijuana sales took place in calendar year 2016, generating nearly $200 million in state tax revenue. These figures do not include revenue generated by local taxes on marijuana. Monthly sales in Colorado topped $100 million in eight of the 12 months. “To put the state’s third year of regulated recreational marijuana sales in perspective, Year One totaled $699.2 million (combined with medical sales) and Year Two jumped up to $996.2 million. The trend should continue in Year Four, but beyond that? It’s a murkier proposition,” reported the Cannabist. In December, dispensary sales were a little more than $114.7 million, a 13 percent increase from the $101.3 million recorded in December 2015.

<h2>MINNESOTA</h2>
Minnesota House Deputy Minority Leader Rep. Jon Applebaum (DFL-Minnetonka) has filed a bill to end cannabis prohibition and regulate marijuana like alcohol for adults ages 21 and up. If passed, bill HF927 would go into effect on January 1, 2018. It would allow adults to possess and purchase up to an ounce of marijuana, and to grow six plants. Rep. Applebaum hopes that all revenues generated by such a program would go toward Minnesota’s public schools. His bill would not permit driving under the influence of cannabis or consumption in public.

<h2>KANSAS</h2>
A proposal to make Kansas the 29th medical marijuana state has been introduced by Senator David Haley (D-Kansas City). SB 155, the Kansas Safe Access Act, would allow seriously ill Kansas residents with certain qualifying conditions to access medical marijuana with a doctor’s recommendation. Sixty-eight percent of Kansans believe that marijuana should be legal for medical purposes.

<h2>NEW HAMPSHIRE</h2>
The New Hampshire House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee voted to pass HB 640, a bill that would decriminalize possession of one ounce or less of marijuana. The vote, 14-2, was overwhelming, and it appears very likely that the House will also pass HB 640 with a huge margin of support. The Committee also voted to “retain” HB 656, a bill that would make marijuana legal for adult use.

<h2>West Virginia</h2>
Legislators in the West Virginia House and Senate introduced bills that would create a medical marijuana program in the state. In the House, Delegate Mike Pushkin and 11 co-sponsors introduced HB 2677, a comprehensive medical marijuana bill titled the “Patient Freedom Act.” In the upper chamber, Senator Richard Ojeda and 11 co-sponsors introduced SB 386, which would make medical marijuana legal and create a Medical Cannabis Commission to administer the program.

		<title>Patient diagnosed with Chiari malformations finds relief with CBD cannabis oil</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Patient diagnosed with Chiari malformations finds relief with CBD cannabis oil</h4>
<p>In 2008 Paula Medina was suffering from anxiety, nerve pain, severe migraines, dizziness, numbness, difficulty swallowing, blurry vision, and tingling throughout her body. She went to two different physicians during the course of 2008 and 2009 for treatment. Both ordered MRIs and upon receiving the results each told her &ldquo;it was all in her head,&rdquo; recollects Medina, who is 48.</p>
<p>Because her symptoms continued to persist she went to a third doctor in 2011 who ordered another MRI. Upon receiving the results, Medina&rsquo;s doctor delivered a diagnosis of Chiari malformations (CMs), which, very simply, are structural defects in the cerebellum. According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorder and Stroke, CMs may develop when the space in the lower rear of the skull is smaller than normal, causing the cerebellum and brain stem to be pushed downward into the foramen magnum and into the upper spinal canal. The resulting pressure on the cerebellum and brain stem may affect functions controlled by these areas and block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)&mdash;the clear liquid that surrounds and cushions the brain and spinal cord&mdash;to and from the brain.</p>
<p>Not only did Medina finally have a diagnosis, but she also had a five-millimeter herniation so she had to schedule brain surgery right away. Her neurologist told her that she had very little spinal fluid flow because it was being blocked by her cerebellum. &ldquo;He told me the sooner the better for the surgery because the damage was already done but I needed to do the surgery so I could start to feel better,&rdquo; recalls Medina.</p>
<p>Even though there is no cure for Chiari, surgery is recommended to help with the debilitating symptoms. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not guaranteed that it will work. In my case it worked for six months and then all my symptoms came back,&rdquo; Medina says <br /> of her December 2011 surgery.</p>
<p>Chiari is a tough diagnosis to make as it is often mistaken for multiple sclerosis (MS) and even when it is diagnosed the treatment options are limited. &ldquo;From the very beginning when I became symptomatic, they tried many pharmaceuticals on me including Gabapentin and Lyrica. I tried several antidepressants and they almost sent me into a comatose state. So I wasn&rsquo;t on them very long and, to be honest, I am not one to go on any kind of opiates. I would rather deal with pain than put poison in my body,&rdquo; Medina says of the pharmaceuticals she took to treat Chiari.</p>
<p>Medina decided to give cannabis a try at the encouragement of her son who thought it would help with her nerve pain and anxiety. She rebuffed him at first as she was raised anti-drug. &ldquo;I was against it but now I am all for it. People look at me like I am crazy but hey, if it works, what can I say?,&rdquo; Medina explains.</p>
<p>Medina tried smoking cannabis but wasn&rsquo;t a fan. She &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t care for the psychoactive part so I found Mary&rsquo;s Medicinal patches in Colorado which worked well, I had a little bit of the psychoactive and it took my pain away for a few hours. I will do a patch or the salve intermittently, it&rsquo;s really helped. Cannabis offered a different kind of relief than with pharmaceuticals. With the pharmaceuticals I had all the side effects.&rdquo; Now Medina takes a capsule of CBD cannabis oil every night to keep her symptoms at bay.</p>
<p>In February, Medina started Chiari Neurological Project (<em>chiarineuro.org</em>) to help others with the disorder. &ldquo;I hate that I have this but I am glad that I am able to live day by day and still have hope and be able to help other people. This is my passion, this is what I am supposed to be doing,&rdquo; she says of giving awareness, consultation, emotional and physical support for those diagnosed with Chiari through the newly formed non-profit.</p>
<p>But Chiari Neurological Project is not just for those who are suffering from Chiari. Medina also welcomes people with other neurological issues. &ldquo;I just want it to be a place where people can go and do some kind of natural holistic healing therapy to keep their mind off of it for a few hours,&rdquo; she enthuses.</p>
<p>As for the doctors Medina consulted with in &rsquo;08 and &rsquo;09, who chocked her symptoms up to being in her head, she paid them each a visit post-brain surgery. &ldquo;I told them I wasn&rsquo;t a hypochondriac, this is what I have and it was on my report when you did my MRI. You were telling me it was all in my head, and it really is all in my head,&rdquo; she relays with an expression of irony.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Justin Alexander</h4>

<p>For those who plan to celebrate Earth Day on April 22 with a nod to cannabis and Mother Earth, a straight-from-the-heavens indica is one way to go. Indicas are what to reach for at the end of a stressful day when it&rsquo;s time to space out or when you need high-level pain relief and a mental break to take you out of this world. It is a sit-on-the-couch, zone-out inducer that creates a full cerebral and body high. In addition to offering different advantages to patients than sativas and hybrids, physically indica plants grow shorter and bushier and have a higher yield in a shorter period of time. To follow is a round-up of the top indicas available at dispensaries in the Las Vegas Valley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GDP by State Flower Cannabis </strong></p>
<p>Granddaddy Purple, also known as GDP, is the stuff of legend thanks to its colorful creator. &ldquo;Ask Ken Estes&mdash;Mr. Granddaddy Purple himself&mdash;about the origins of GDP and he will tell you some fantastic story about how he was gifted his GDP cut from a Native American tribe in Humboldt County roughly three decades ago,&rdquo; says Daniel Wacks, co-founder of State Flower Cannabis. &ldquo;What we do know for a fact though is that GDP is a distant descendant of Afghani.&rdquo; Also, this is the strain that patients think of when they hear about &ldquo;purple weed,&rdquo; thanks to its stunning color. State Flower Cannabis has been growing this strain since 2005 and at that time it was the most popular varietal on the West Coast by far and most aptly represented Bay Area marijuana culture. &ldquo;If there was ever a fragrance engineered to smell like the Bay Area in 2005, it would smell of GDP and Swisher Sweets,&rdquo; Wacks says. On the nose, deeply whiff the scent of dark chocolate and grape, similar to a rich red wine. On the eyes, take in the dark purple color&mdash;genetically inherent to the strain&mdash;big juicy trichomes and copper colored hairs. On the mind, imagine the sensation of what it feels like to be rich dark chocolate coursing through a cascading dessert fountain. You will be one step closer to living this delicious dream after smoking GDP. A very potent indica, the couch-lock comes on almost immediately and the heavy high at 19.21 percent THC works well when coping with pain, both mild and severe. GDP is the epitome of chill, assisting with sleep disorders, migraines, pain relief, muscle relaxation, appetite stimulation and nausea, according to Wacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kynd&rsquo;s Cadillac Purple Sap CO2 Dab Oil</strong></p>
<p>Sweet in smell and golden in color, a dab of the Cadillac Purple Sap will do you well. A long-term high, this outstanding product intensifies as time goes by even when consumed in the smallest quantities. The tongue twister of a name pays homage to its parents Blackberry Kush, the Black and Purple Urkle. &ldquo;Cadillac Purple is an intense indica strain known for full body relaxation and pain relief,&rdquo; says Dave Zimmerman, director of extraction at Kynd Cannabis Company. &ldquo;It lacks the heady cerebral impact of sativa-heavy hybrids. Its effects, which tend to be soothing to the body and calming overall, often lead to high-quality sleep. The buds of Cadillac Purple are a rich green with splashes of purple, and the aroma is mild and quite floral.&rdquo; Preferred by those looking for relief from pain, stress, anxiety, lack of appetite and insomnia, you might find yourself chewing on the potent and lingering terp aftertaste before running into the kitchen for a snack, and then crashing into a cloud of sweet dreams. &ldquo;You can taste the plant&rsquo;s composition quite clearly. We add no additives of any kind, so this is Cadillac Purple in its purest form,&rdquo; Zimmerman says. &ldquo;Dabbing is recommended for high-tolerance patients looking to alleviate symptoms quickly.&rdquo; At 71.25% THC/.21% CBD, expect a euphoric body high and a pleasing happy/hungry/sleepy hybrid feeling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The+Source&rsquo;s Master Kush</strong></p>
<p>Originally called High Rise, Master Kush obtained its name from the growers who created it in the towering residential blocks of Amsterdam, says Tommy Ballman, director of cultivation at The+Source. Origins can be traced to Hindu Kush and Skunk and it is a favorite of many celebrities including rapper Snoop Dogg. &ldquo;We've been growing this for one year, and it's a popular strain with great attributes,&rdquo; Ballman says of Master Kush, which has 20 percent THC. The first and most noticeable expression of this strain is in its taste, which is as down to earth as the high. Deep and sweet, this will bring you into your body and take away all the physical stresses while still remaining alert. Recommended for patients who are fighting cancer, anxiety, depression, insomnia and lack of appetite, after smoking, the body becomes gooey and the yawns may emerge more quickly than you initially anticipated&mdash;once these two things occur it can be said that you are well on the way to a coherent, mellowed out bliss. Master the mind and body with Master Kush.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Remedy&rsquo;s Bio-Jesus</strong></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a large community of patients who favor strains in the Diesel family due to their intoxicating smell and pungent gasoline flavor. A spawn of Gumbo and Bio-Diesel, Bio-Jesus is definitely of this variety. &ldquo;It starts with a nice strong head high that moves into a more relaxing body high as more is consumed,&rdquo; says Chris Welch, cultivation manager of Remedy. &ldquo;[It&rsquo;s] high octane.&rdquo; With a THC level of 28.64 percent, turn to Bio-Jesus for superb relief from insomnia and pain and for when you need that happy, relaxed feeling with brain haze. For experienced consumers, Bio-Jesus is good for making that transition from the daytime you to the nighttime you. It turns off the lights from woes and work and allows you to regain a sense of positive self while reveling in deep relaxation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Medizin&rsquo;s OGKB 2.0</strong></p>
<p>Characterized as having the essence of &ldquo;berry cream funk&rdquo; by Chris Wren, Medizin&rsquo;s vice president of operations, the flavor and smell of OGKB 2.0, which supposedly stands for OG Kush Breath, is tremendously unique. Even the smoke is delightful as it wafts away and fills the room with a pleasurable odor of earthy pine. &ldquo;We started growing this variety at the end of 2016,&rdquo; Wren says. &ldquo;Her immediate success can be attributed to the overall desirable characteristics&mdash;dense, round purple indica buds covered in trichomes and THC that tests over 25 percent&mdash;that seems to be what the current customer base is looking for.&rdquo; Stellar for anxiety, pain and insomnia, this indica is true to form in its effects but not in its grow. Unlike other indicas, &ldquo;it's a real slow plant to grow and isn't what you would consider a high yielding strain,&rdquo; Wren says. Smoke, reflect and appreciate this meditative state thanks to OGKB 2.0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do-Si-Dos from Matrix </strong></p>
<p>With THC in the 23 to 29 percent range, Do-Si-Dos is an indica-dominant hybrid strain that blends Girl Scout Cookies with Face Off OG. Matrix&rsquo;s Evan Marder sings its praises for a variety of reasons&mdash;starting with the aesthetics. &ldquo;It has an amazing look and it is one of the most beautiful strains I have seen,&rdquo; he says, pointing to the array of colors encapsulated on each bud such as lime green and lavender leaves. The nose is just as interesting, emanating both an earthy pine and a &ldquo;floral funkiness. The taste is very Kush-like and it has a wonderful berry exhale,&rdquo; offers Marder. Do-Si-Dos is like a relaxing cup of sleepy time tea, taking away the stress and anxiety that leads to insomnia. The buzz starts off strong and then melts down over the body with time into a sedative level of relaxation. If you want to end the day hungry, happy and in the calm zone, reach for Do-Si-Dos &mdash; <br /> a true force of greatness in the world of indicas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kabunky&rsquo;s Skywalker OG</strong></p>
<p>The force will definitely be with you when using Skywalker OG, a cross of Skywalker and OG Kush, to medicate a range of ailments from body pain to insomnia that bring you heavily into a full body and mind high. &ldquo;Skywalker OG is the perfect balance between the cerebral and physical highs, just like the dark and light side of the Skywalker family. Not only does Skywalker bring you to a galaxy far, far away with euphoric thoughts, but it also cuts your pain like a light saber through Anakin's arm,&rdquo; says Kabunky&rsquo;s Chris DeGraff. &ldquo;Skywalker OG, just like the family's midi-chlorians full of The Force in the famous saga, is full of terpenes including Caryophyllene, the happiness terpene, paired with the Limonene, a natural anti-depressant and anti-anxiety which adds to the euphoric and happy feeling, and the Myrcene brings the smoker into full body relaxation as well as helps with falling and staying asleep.&rdquo; With 21.94 percent THC, Skywalker OG takes away anxiety, depression and puts an overall sunny hue&mdash;with its spicy/citrus flavor&mdash;on even the most difficult days. Seasoned smokers delight in the strength of this experience and even though there is an abundance of couch-lock, you will find your way to the snack drawer thanks to this appetite stimulating indica-hybrid. Use caution when operating your light saber.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Grove&rsquo;s Starkiller </strong></p>
<p>The Grove&rsquo;s StarKiller is also an ode to &ldquo;Star Wars.&rdquo; According to Kevin Biernacki, director of cultivation for The Grove, StarKiller is named for Galen Marek (also known as The Apprentice), who is the Dark Jedi anti-hero protagonist of the &ldquo;Star Wars: The Force Unleashed&rdquo; project. &ldquo;We started growing this strain in February 2016 when we opened the doors to our cultivation facility as one of our premium strains,&rdquo; says Biernacki. Comprised of 70 percent indica and 30 percent sativa, its origins are the original Skywalker OG Kush and the Rare Dankness #2 produced by Rare Dankness seed company. Used for insomnia, pain relief and PTSD, among other ailments, it tests at 27.5 percent THC. A strong citrus aftertaste is one of the hallmarks of this flavorful experience, but upfront you will be hit by pine on your palate. Those who love OG will quickly pick up those notes as well. A smooth high with no peaks and valleys, StarKiller will induce a deep sleep and a complete mental tune out. Although great as a concentrate, first, we recommend enjoying it in this lovely flowery form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>White Walker OG by Cannabiotix</strong></p>
<p>Snowy, golf-ball size buds make the White Walker OG a true beauty. But then you take a taste and hear the backstory and you will most likely fall even deeper in love. &ldquo;The name came about because it&rsquo;s an extremely frosty strain,&rdquo; says Cory Calcagno, head cultivator at Cannabiotix. &ldquo;The team is a big fan of &ldquo;Game of Thrones&rdquo;&mdash;it is super snowy, really frosty, winter is coming...&rdquo; Since Cannabiotix started growing this strain in 2012, it has not only become a popular consumer choice, but has achieved top honors in various contests. Calcagno calls it a Michael Phelps strain &ldquo;because it has won a lot of gold. I think that it has become a fan favorite because it is one of the gassier, crystal-laden, original-Kush smelling and [tasting] OGs out there,&rdquo; he says, noting, &ldquo;It has always had a very strong lemon-gas smell and a very potent, couch-loving indica high. It is a quintessential indica&mdash;heavy-hitting OG Kush.&rdquo; With 27.8 percent THC, patients should look to White Walker OG for relief from insomnia, chronic pain and anxiety. It doesn&rsquo;t take long after the first hit to realize that this is an intense stoned feeling with tremendous couch melt. The next thing that follows will be eyelid droop and then you know you are well on the way to total relaxation&mdash;get ready for a nap within 45 minutes. &nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>&ldquo;When people first hear about it, most of the time the responses we get are: &lsquo;I have been doing that for years. It&rsquo;s great I can do it with other people now,&rsquo;&rdquo; explains Irena Jacobson. &ldquo;Everybody does it but now we get to do it together. There&rsquo;s no hiding it, there&rsquo;s no judgment.&rdquo; </strong></p>
<p>Jacobson, who is one of the co-founders of CannaYoga, is referring to elevating your mind and body while practicing yoga with a little bit of cannabis to help you find your center. She and Madelaine Beckett offer CannaYin and CannaYinFlow classes at their Wishing Wellness studio as well as at various pop-up locations around the city. Although it was slow when they first started offering classes in August, there was a spike in attendance once Nevada legalized adult-use cannabis following the election in November.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still a stigma associated with cannabis but I wanted to create a space for patients to experience this together because everything is so new, especially here in the city. I work with a lot of patients so that&rsquo;s what geared me in this direction,&rdquo; offers Beckett, who works with her husband, Dr. Timothy Beckett, as manager of Valley Center for Cannabis Therapy.</p>
<p>Initially, Beckett&rsquo;s husband thought she was crazy when she suggested pairing yoga and cannabis. But she reasoned that patients might be more inclined if they could &ldquo;combine the two and we could get them out of their comfort zone to come and try this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Certainly CannaYoga&rsquo;s tagline -- combining two of the world&rsquo;s greatest ancient healing practices -- gets to the heart of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sending the patients to the studio because they were coming to Valley Center for Cannabis Therapy to treat some kind of pain. Whether you have cancer or PTSD, cannabis isn&rsquo;t the only thing that&rsquo;s going to get you better -- it&rsquo;s a whole change in lifestyle of not just doing yoga but changing your way of eating. I was also encouraging our patients to introduce some sort of workout to get their bodies more active,&rdquo; continues Beckett. &ldquo;Not only for them to workout but to get them in the right mindset to work on issues they are dealing with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We like to try and get to know our clients and have them open up to us and provide them with that safe space so that they are comfortable and feel that they are actually getting health benefits, which is the main goal. It&rsquo;s not just a social hour where you would do what you would do in a frat house,&rdquo; says Jacobson, who is also coincidentally married to a physician also in the cannabis space, Dr. Scott Jacobson, of Wishing Wellness Medical.</p>
<p>Each one-hour class is $25 ($20 for industry professionals when they scan their agent card online) and begins with a quick discussion on a topic that could be anything from vaping to the difference between a sativa and an indica. &ldquo;We make it nice and fun and light,&rdquo; explains Beckett, who has been practicing yoga since she was 16 and her especially bendy physique shows it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We set up ashtrays and lighters by the mats. We all pass around whatever there is to pass around. Everybody partakes or not,&rdquo; says Jacobson, who has been practicing yoga for 25 years with a passion for Acroyoga. &ldquo;Sometimes couples come and one may be in a job where they get tested so they don&rsquo;t partake and their partner does. It&rsquo;s not weird if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t encourage novice cannabis users to attend. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t think you have to have done yoga before. Our classes are great for all levels but we don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea for clients to be trying cannabis for the first time at our class. So far we&rsquo;ve never had anyone sign up who has never tried cannabis before. Everyone +21 and older is welcome but we expect our clients to know their limitations,&rdquo; explains Jacobson.</p>
<p>For yoga beginners, the classes aren&rsquo;t especially rigorous or hard to pick up. &ldquo;Classes are very good for your elevated state of mind. They aren&rsquo;t like hot yoga classes where they are quick moving,&rdquo; says Jacobson. &ldquo;For the CannaYin classes, the philosophy is you don&rsquo;t have to get up off your mat. You can sit and lay down and the most we would do is a cat-cow kneeling on your mat, otherwise, it is all passive, on-your-mat poses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beckett elaborates, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not as many active poses in CannaYinFlow. You are still doing active poses but I move you through them very slowly to warm up our bodies. Then during the last 30 minutes of the class we go into yin, it&rsquo;s very restorative and relaxing. You are able to zone out with the music or with your own breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the Yin class, where you hold the pose for three to six minutes on any given side, it&rsquo;s not really that you are doing that many poses in the course of an hour but you are holding them and you are able to relax and able to get into those deep tissues and let your mind concentrate and try to be very meditative. When you find that your mind is wandering, bring your mind back and if there is a stretch where you feel uncomfortable breathe into that stretch. Everybody feels so amazing after class. We had one client say that she felt two inches taller afterward, which is always how I feel,&rdquo; Jacobson explains with a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>The relaxed approach fostered at CannaYoga seems to work well. &ldquo;The feedback has been amazing from patients,&rdquo; enthuses Beckett. &ldquo;One of the patients who came, texted me when she got home and said it was one of the first times she felt relaxed enough to get in bed and go to sleep because she didn&rsquo;t feel her pain. She said she had never been pain-free in five years and now she was. And that&rsquo;s what we want, to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Class sizes at CannaYoga depend on the location and theme, but the studio caps classes at 40. For larger classes, Jacobson and Beckett work as a team with one leading and the other helping to provide adjustments, massage, water, and pre-roll relighting. CannaYoga also offers popup classes at local dispensaries and medical clinics as well as special workshops such as one they held recently on edibles that lasted two hours and featured 10 milligram gummies.</p>
<p>Many of the pop-up classes are in collaboration with other small business and non-profits. Special events scheduled this month include a Yindica class as well as an Earth Day class, of which a portion of the proceeds will be donated to a local environmental non-profit. Special classes and workshops are advertised at <em>cannayogalv.com</em>.</p>
<p>As for appropriate canna-yoga etiquette, you can partake in what is available at the class, bring your own cannabis or just enjoy practicing with your fellow yogis sans cannabis. The CannaYogis recommend a hybrid or indica for the CannaYin class and suggest a sativa for the CannaYinFlow class. To make sure attendees are completely comfortable, teachers don&rsquo;t indulge when they are instructing. &ldquo;We join everybody but, yet, we are working and our job is to cultivate a safe experience for our students,&rdquo; offers Jacobson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The patients I do speak with about cannayoga, this is new for them so I don&rsquo;t want them to come into a space where they are uncomfortable. I want the space to be very welcoming to everyone, not just one demographic. We try to appeal to everyone by focusing on education,&rdquo; explains Beckett, who adds in conclusion, &ldquo;Yoga is my medicine and cannabis is my medicine.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Richard S. Gubbe</h4>
<p>Budder, badder, honeycomb, flower, kief and oil sound like ingredients in a culinary creation from Martha and Snoop&rsquo;s Potluck Dinner Party. All that&rsquo;s needed for this concoction is a can of bisque to get started.</p>
<p>The above are actually the many varieties of concentrates that make up more than one-third of the buying power at a Nevada dispensary, which is now more than the flower and edible categories. That figure is likely to rise as the industry gets safer, more environmentally friendly and more creative in separating oil from plant to create a very concentrated form of the plant&rsquo;s active ingredients.</p>
<p>While there are many pluses, there are potential perils as well, with risks shared by both manufacturers and consumers. A line is being drawn with the thinking that solvents, no matter how little remain in the final product, have left their mark during the process. The addition of a toxin or the altering of the original profile of the flower has consequences for the plant profile with benefits to the patient. There are advantages to all extraction methods, such as using altered profiles in a pharmaceutical way to affect change for certain illnesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Concentrated History </strong></p>
<p>The most basic way to extract began when the first human hand rolled a cannabis bud around and around to separate the plant from the oil. This &ldquo;system&rdquo; gave birth to hashish and that method is still used today. In the Netherlands, for instance, black hand-rolled Nepalese hash from India and Nepal is supplied to more than 250 coffee shops. Hash oil from heated cannabis was prominent in the states in the early &lsquo;70s and was heated in a glass pipe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When open butane systems came along, the cost and risks were high to obtain the precious oils of CBD, THC and terpenes combined in one mixture. The open loop system of pushing butane through a tube of flower and taking out the oil while the butane was released into the atmosphere was stone-age thinking reserved for people who don&rsquo;t mind an explosion or two.</p>
<p>The closed-loop system followed and was safer. But butane, although contained and recycled in the closed loop, is dangerous to inhale. Most of the butane is recaptured while the oil separates to become what is commonly called shatter. Shatter can be manipulated to form budder, batter, honeycomb or wax and packaged to sell. The oil can then be filtered further to eliminate all foreign chemical agents for distillate concentrates, edibles, body oils and CBD-only or CBD dominated products used in vape pens and creams.</p>
<p>The extraction of butane after the initial separation of oil is separated into THC, CBD, and terpenes. The elements can be mixed or used separately. Cartridges can then be filled for vaporizing pens, but chemicals for texture along with flavoring and food additives are sometimes added, causing health concerns.</p>
<p>Now the industry has come full circle, providing solvent-less products although higher in price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Young and Restless Chefs</strong></p>
<p>Extraction expertise is the realm of the young. While patients cover all ages, those in the manufacturing side are predominantly under 25. Kyle Feria, chief of extraction at EPC labs, and Alec Blaeser, head of the extraction room for Shango, are two examples of those forging careers from street knowledge into positions of stature in Nevada. Both lab wizards have worked in labs in other states and spend their days tinkering with gadgets, temperature, and pressure to separate plant from product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EPC is an earth-friendly MME producing only organic products, while Shango is a full-service facility from flower to cookies. They differ on the use of butane. Shango has a high customer demand for concentrates and also makes like Willy Wonka with an array of edibles, all created at one site. While butane extraction leads specific profiles, there is the constant threat of explosion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole job is dangerous most of the day,&rdquo; Blaeser says of working in an extraction facility. &ldquo;It takes a lot of focus and dedication.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Think of an extraction facility as a group of Keebler <br /> elves working hard and creating new products as they go, while simultaneously conforming to stringent state- mandated regulation.</p>
<p>The reasoning is easy to understand: vapor and liquid ingestion is better than the evils that accompany smoking anything. Hard to explain to someone who is ill that they have to smoke something to feel better when they can eat it, vaporize, or apply it to their skin.</p>
<p>Before flower makes a trip to the lab to be tested it is cured and flash frozen. The most ideal way is to freeze the product while it grows, but most often the freezing comes after the stalk is cut down. Some wait until the bud is separated to freeze it, but that isn&rsquo;t an optimum procedure for quality assurance. This will disturb the trichomes prior to extraction.</p>
<p>The leaf from the plant is more valued these days. Rather than using it in prerolls, the leaf is full of trichomes and kief that can be harvested to make hash, bubble hash and more. The entire plant is used in some capacity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please Pass the Solvent</strong></p>
<p>Once the buds are separated, they are put into a long cylinder and loaded into the extraction system. A supply of butane is then cooled into a vapor and sent through the cylinder. The oils extracted from the plant material are collected into a separate chamber. The hardened oil can be packaged and sold as shatter, which is a popular consistency to use for vaporizing in small amounts or &ldquo;dabs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything starts out as shatter and then you can turn it into anything you want,&rdquo; Blaeser says. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re taking out most of the butane to get as close to zero as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to state testing agents, excessive amounts of butane are typically found in extractions. Extractions can contain up to 500 parts per million (called RSA on a state label) with an average of 25 to 250 found on most shatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m worried about what that does to you in the long-term,&rdquo; says Feria. &ldquo;There is not enough research or history on the health aspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The industry is concerned too. Matthew Gardiner, VP at Shango, notes, &ldquo;You are going to see a lot more solvent-less products in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosin is the best example of an easier method of extraction but with a lower return on oil. A hair straightener was one crude way to extract oil, now the method is more advanced but not that large of a yield when using butane. Rosin is a relatively new extraction technique utilizing mechanical separation involving precise heat, pressure and timing to create terpene-rich oils similar to extracts created using hydrocarbons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer badder because there are a lot more terpenes in badder and less of them evaporate,&rdquo; Blaeser says, noting that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like scooping ice cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By taking the process one step further with CO2 extraction, called distillate, it contains no butane but is separated into terpenes, CBD, and THC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Apothecary Style </strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;It takes a lot of practice but you can create your own ratio,&rdquo; says Blaeser, who started as a medical patient and, at age 24, has years of manufacturing experience from Colorado. He is working on HCSFE (high cannabinoid full spectrum extract) and HTFSE (high terpene full spectrum extract) methods for mixing products to order. Blaeser created a CBD-dominant mixture called Charlotte&rsquo;s Cherries, using coconut oil as an additive.</p>
<p>With all their licenses, Shango has the flexibility to fill a customer order for a specific illness. &ldquo;We would love to fill something and have the evidence it worked,&rdquo; Gardiner says.</p>
<p>Feria, despite his age, is more old-fashioned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re playing God at this point,&rdquo; Feria explains of mixing elements. &ldquo;Besides destroying the structure, you are losing the full spectrum and capability of what that plant can do. We don&rsquo;t destroy that structure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>EPC makes rosin chips using food-grade pressing screens. They also produce whole plant cannabis capsules made with organic virgin coconut oil as well as temple ball hash as high as 80 percent THC without solvents, and ice water sieve to collect ripe trichome heads. EPC also utilizes heat press and low-temp vapor distillation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For people medicating with hash, you get more of your life back -- you don&rsquo;t have to medicate as often,&rdquo; Feria relayed to <em>elevate</em>. To further avoid butane, &ldquo;I light a hemp wick with a lighter and hover it above the ball until it bubbles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feria often goes to the harvest of plants to assure the process is performed in the same day. &ldquo;We eliminate the need for solvents and expensive machinery and are able to provide the community with the highest quality clean concentrates,&rdquo; says EPC boss Rick Stierwalt. &ldquo;The way he (Feria) does it is more enriched than going through cutting and stripping machines. It&rsquo;s like a hand-crafted Bentley versus a Ford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Steinwalt submitted his temple ball hash for the first time to the state for approval, &ldquo;The state said, &lsquo;Wow, this in on point and at a whole new level,&rsquo;&rdquo; Stierwalt recalls. &ldquo;Cannabis products need only meet state standards and earth-friendly derivations have been welcomed thus far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For EPC, they use nothing but organic right down to the packaging. &ldquo;The mandate is to make good medicine and we think solvent-less is the best way to make medicine,&rdquo; Stierwalt says. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to enter any process into the medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or be a polluter. &ldquo;We believe so much in the environment that we package temple balls with hemp and you can light it with hemp and not let butane touch your product. Our philosophy is being respectful of the earth and the people on the earth,&rdquo; explains Stierwalt. &ldquo;We use recycled bags, recycled water, and packaging that will stamp into the ground and sprout flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feria says it&rsquo;s easy to bypass solvents when medicating. &ldquo;You can put some crumble on top of a bowl or put a fuse of pressed rosin in the core of a joint. Those are simple ways to get the full effect of a concentrate using familiar tools,&rdquo; he offers. &ldquo;A hash pipe can take a few different forms but is essentially a pipe with a very fine screen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The more steps taken in extraction, generally, the more the product costs, but for most, $30 of cannabis disappears faster than smoking a half-gram of concentrate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A Little Dab&rsquo;ll Do Ya</strong></p>
<p><em>The rig</em>: Just as the Brylcreem commercial boasted, just a little dab... In order to heat the oil enough to turn it to vapor, the most common method is from a &ldquo;rig.&rdquo; The rig can be an elaborate or compact glass apparatus that resembles what old-timers call a bong. But to heat the "nail" or "bucket" (quartz, ceramic or titanium) that a dab is inserted on, a blow torch, small as it is, <br /> is necessary. The rig will stop most Baby Boomers from doing <br /> this procedure on their own, although there&rsquo;s evidence even grandma dabs (search &ldquo;dads with dabs&rdquo; videos). For the experienced dabber, the rig is not a big deal, although technological advancements will lead to a better way in the <br /> not-to-distant future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>The Volcano</em>&rdquo;: Ground fresh flower heats up in a glass bowl above the element in the vaporizer. There are many kinds of vaporizers, but the Volcano is the most efficient and versatile. A coupler is placed over the heat element and air is sucked through a tube. The flower is heated anywhere from 260 up to 300 degrees, hot enough to separate the&nbsp; oil to breathe in without lighting the flower on fire. This may be overall the safest system in play. No torches and no smoke, only vapor and electricity.</p>
<p><em>Dab pens</em>: They have a compartment for flower or concentrate and a more powerful battery.</p>
<p><em>Syringes</em>: A thinner, syrup-like substance is easier to handle and more easily diluted.</p>
<p><em>Vape pens</em>: &ldquo;For the beginner, I recommend a pen &ndash; it&rsquo;s a lot less complicated and more accessible,&rdquo; suggests Blaeser. This portable, ingenious system uses a new type of battery that can heat oil into vapor. They are discrete, not smelly, and last long. There are disposable units that start around $22 for a quarter gram of extract. A full gram is priced between $50 to $75.</p>
<p>Vape pens can contain any mix of THC, CBD, and terpenes. Clear oil is CBD only, with a food additive often added to give the vapor a white color to resemble smoke. A solvent is usually added for less expensive pens to achieve proper viscosity. Vape pens can contain propylene glycol, also called propane-1,2-diol, a synthetic organic compound that is a colorless liquid with a faintly sweet taste that &ldquo;winterizes&rdquo; or thins the oil. Chemically it is classed as a diol and is miscible with a broad range of solvents, including water, acetone and chloroform. It is used in the production of polymers as well as used in food processing and as a process fluid in low temperature heat exchange applications such as vape pens. &ldquo;Our vape pens are uncut and we don&rsquo;t add anything to it. Others add a solvent for viscosity of the oil in order for a cheap cartridge to burn it. We use a high-end without glycerin,&rdquo; explains Feria of EPC&rsquo;s solvent-less pens. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in flavoring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t I just take a pill? Soon. The race is on to perfect the extraction process while also improving on the delivery for consumption. All that&rsquo;s needed is a formula. See the March issue of <em>elevate</em> for the story (page 30) on forthcoming pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Until then, yabba, dabba doo or don&rsquo;t &ndash; it is your choice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Amanda Connor, Connor & Connor</h4>
</br>
<p>There are multiple perspectives on the &ldquo;Patient&rsquo;s Bill of Rights.&rdquo; The term has been floating around for decades, typically when outlining the rights of a patient regarding their healthcare. More recently, in 2010, President Obama announced his version of the Patient&rsquo;s Bill of Rights for the Affordable Care Act. But the Patient&rsquo;s Bill of Rights, in whichever version or form, has many goals (both explicitly and implicitly within).</p>
<p>The original goals of the Patient&rsquo;s Bill of Rights were to:</p>
<ol style="margin-left:50px">
<li>Enhance patient confidence in the healthcare system;</li>
<li>Show importance of the relationship between<br /> patients and providers; and</li>
<li>Stress the roles of patients and providers in<br /> maintaining health.</li>
</ol>
<p>These goals are pretty straightforward however, they can be interpreted broadly. For example, assuring the fairness and equality in our healthcare system is inherent in these goals. The right to feel safe and respected is also inherent. Additionally, the goals can be read to encourage patients to address problems, questions, and issues and encourage patients to stay active and informed about their health.</p>
<p>Other patient rights include the right to access information, meaning the patient has a right to easily understand information and full disclosure about their health. Patients also have a right to choose their healthcare providers and have access to emergency services, as well as to be free from discrimination. This particular patient right was highlighted in the Affordable Care Act and President Obama&rsquo;s take on the Patient&rsquo;s Bill of Rights &ndash; making it clear that healthcare providers could not discriminate against pre-existing conditions. Patients also have a say in their treatments and medical decisions, including the right to refuse treatment. Lastly, patients have a right to confidentiality over their medical history. The right to confidentiality was highlighted in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), a 1996 Act to protect patients&rsquo; privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Patient&rsquo;s Rights Applied to the Marijuana Industry </strong></p>
<p>When medical marijuana was legalized in Nevada, it made recipients of marijuana into patients. Those purchasing marijuana are often suffering from chronic pain, debilitating diseases, and other ailments that affect daily life. So naturally, it would seem the traditional Patient&rsquo;s Bill of Rights (applying to all &ldquo;patients&rdquo;) also applies to medical marijuana patients. However, it is not that simple. The Patient&rsquo;s Bill of Rights is most often seen on the federal level, and the federal government does not recognize state-approved medical marijuana.</p>
<p>But the general patient&rsquo;s rights could still be applicable to the marijuana industry and many of these rights are presumed to still apply. For instance, medical marijuana patients can choose their dispensary and their healthcare provider from which they wish to obtain a patient card. Patients also have a say in their treatment by discussing strains and courses of treatment with experts and doctors. Additionally, patients do have some privacy rights regarding disclosure about medical marijuana status, however, this is a more limited right due to drug testing and some employment requirements. Lastly, and most importantly, patients have the right to access marijuana, which was a previously prohibited type of medicine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Nevada Specific: Senate Bill 329</strong></p>
<p>Nevada does not have an official Patient&rsquo;s Bill of Rights for medical marijuana yet. A codified version does not exist but there are some versions floating around that typically vary with each medical center. So while there are some rights inherent in the law, they are not enumerated into a formal document. During this legislative session, Nevada State Senator Segerblom is attempting to formalize the Medical Marijuana Patients&rsquo; Bill of Rights starting with the introduction of SB 329 in the Senate on March 20. However, until that is passed, current law (despite no Bill of Rights) could be read to include some rights for medical marijuana patients, including: the right to access medical marijuana for qualifying medical conditions; the right to be free from criminal prosecution for ingestion or possession of medical marijuana for valid cardholders; the right to home cultivation in limited circumstances; the right to a caregiver if necessary; and the right to access medical marijuana dispensaries in Nevada. While these are limited, it is definitely a start, and it can be presumed that patients&rsquo; rights will only continue to grow in Nevada as legislation is made.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Wishing Wellness Medical opens two locations&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Scott Jacobson has opened Wishing Wellness Medical. Formerly the medical director of Iora Health&rsquo;s Turntable Health in downtown Las Vegas, Dr. Jacobson&rsquo;s new practice, which opened in mid-March, specializes in functional medicine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been doing a lot of functional medicine, which is kind of a more holistic medical approach using some of the herbs and botanicals to treat patients, and cannabis is just another herb in the arsenal,&rdquo; explains Dr. Jacobson. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a lot of talk about cannabis in the functional medicine community and so I started doing some research on it. We started going to dispensaries, talking to budtenders, learning more, reading the National Academies, which just published a big compendium of all the research on medical cannabis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noticing a void in the marketplace, Dr. Jacobson decided rather than returning to the status quo of traditional healthcare he would charter a different path. &ldquo;I really wanted to have a place for people to go because a lot of people get their patient cards and then they are just kind of shoved out into the world to figure it out on their own. They really don&rsquo;t have the guidance and that&rsquo;s a void I really wanted to fill."</p>
<p>Some of the gaps he would like to fill include, &ldquo;having somebody to actually talk about your medicine, how to titrate it, what is it you are actually looking for, what you need, and how can we get you on the best medicine &ndash; these are all practicalities that need to be addressed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wishing Wellness Medical has two locations: 10120 South Eastern Avenue in Henderson and 10161 Park Run Drive. <em>wishingwellnessmedical.com</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clark County appoints Green Ribbon Advisory Panel</p>
<p>Clark County Commission has assembled a 12-member Green Ribbon Advisory Panel to make recommendations regarding zoning and businesses licensing of the recreational marijuana industry. Members from the marijuana industry, the gaming and retail industries, and professional associations related to recreational and medical marijuana, were selected in early March and include:</p>
<p>Nevada Gaming Control Board/Gaming Commission: <br /> Dr. Tony Alamo, Nevada Gaming Commission chairman</p>
<p>Nevada Resort Association: Virginia Valentine, Nevada Resort Association president</p>
<p>Local casino interests: consultant Lucy Stewart, and Andrew Abboud of Las Vegas Sands Corp.</p>
<p>Medical Marijuana Dispensary: Frank Hawkins, owner of Nevada Wellness Center</p>
<p>Medical Marijuana Cultivation, standalone: Howard Starr, managing member of Las Vegas Natural Caregivers/House of Herbs</p>
<p>Medical Marijuana Cultivation, integrated: Armen Yemenidjian, Integral Associates CEO</p>
<p>Medical Marijuana Laboratory: Dr. Chao-Hsiung Tung, CEO and scientific director of G3 Labs</p>
<p>Medical Marijuana Production Establishment: <br /> Jay Matos, lobbyist</p>
<p>Medical Marijuana Patient Advocate: Carmen Jones, pediatrician and physician consultant for Wellness Center</p>
<p>Medical Marijuana Industry Association: Andrew Jolley, Nevada Organic Remedies CEO</p>
<p>Nevada Retail Association: John DiBella, Nevada Pure/Shango owner and Nevada Retail Association member</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Known across the industry for providing cannabis testing that reveals what&rsquo;s really in your marijuana, DB Labs has partnered with Grow For Vets USA to provide complimentary testing of the medical cannabis products that Grow For Vets provides free of charge to veterans. As two companies committed to delivering a safe alternative to prescription drugs to veterans suffering from PTSD, chronic pain, and other serious medical conditions, the partnership was a natural fit.</p>

<p>DB Labs conducts analytical cannabis testing that yields accurate, detailed reports. Supplying veterans with cannabis that has been safely tested and cleared of any possible mold, heavy metals, pesticides, or other contaminants is very important to DB Labs, according to President Susan Bunce. As a family member of several veterans and an active community member, Bunce reportedly sought out an opportunity to help our heroes who are suffering from the lasting deleterious impact of service.</p>

<p>Roger B. Martin, Founder and Executive Director of Grow For Vets, is excited that the partnership will benefit their growing community of veterans. As a veteran who has suffered with pain for more than 40 years, Martin credits cannabis with saving his life by allaying his dependency on Oxycotin and Ambien. He was inspired to launch the national nonprofit Grow For Vets in early 2014. Grow for Vets has helped thousands of veterans overcome prescription dependency and life-long pain by providing them with more than $1.2 million dollars worth of free medical cannabis products.</p>

<p>Headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada, Grow For Vets aspires to save the more than 50 veterans who die each day from suicide and prescription drug overdose. Working together with DB Labs, Grow For Vets will continue to improve the lives of American heroes who all too often are forgotten, in pain, and who are in need of help.</p>

<p>If you or a friend or loved one are a veteran with PTSD, depression, or any other medical condition, please reach out to Grow For Vets to learn more about obtaining free medical cannabis. For those companies interested in analytical cannabis testing that dispels the mystery of what&rsquo;s really in your cannabis, please reach out to DB Labs for more information and a consultation.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>How to Choose the Right Commercial Cannabis Greenhouse</title>
		<link>https://elevatenv.com/how-to-choose-the-right-commercial-cannabis-greenhouse/</link>
		<pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2017 20:03:35 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this month&rsquo;s Grower&rsquo;s Spotlight, Shane Hutto, owner and CEO of Horticultural Solutions Ltd., shares his thoughts and experience with regard to selecting a commercial greenhouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What does a greenhouse look like?</strong></p>
<p>Most people have a picture in their head of what a greenhouse should look like. However, there are several variations on greenhouse designs and building materials. At its core, a greenhouse is a structure with a translucent or transparent ceiling to allow sunlight in. The structure can be made of steel, wood, or hard plastic, and the translucent material can be glass, polyethylene, or some other translucent material.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenhouses vary in style from a simple polytunnel, which is a plastic covering over PVC hoops in the ground, to a &ldquo;hybrid greenhouse&rdquo; which has solid side walls and a translucent ceiling. These styles offer different benefits. A polytunnel allows farms to cheaply implement greenhouse benefits in their fields, while a hybrid greenhouse provides additional security, legal protection, and safety for the grow operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenhouses can also be rated by their size and technology implementation. A greenhouse that is &ldquo;large&rdquo; not only has more square footage, but also higher ceilings. These higher ceilings provide an environmental &ldquo;buffer zone&rdquo; of air, making environmental control more precise. A high-tech facility with automated irrigation systems, automatic water processing, and automatic environmental controls is considered a &ldquo;high-grade&rdquo; greenhouse, whereas a &ldquo;low-grade&rdquo; greenhouse requires significantly more manual input to regulate the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Greenhouse Market</strong></p>
<p>There are a very large number of greenhouse manufacturers on the market today. The manufacturer you choose will depend on the size and technology of the greenhouse that you want. If you want heavily automated greenhouses, <a href="http://www.havecon.com/en/">Havecon</a> is a very sensible choice. <a href="http://www.harnois.com/en">Harnois</a> builds some middle-of-the-road greenhouses that are very sturdy. If you want to try a low-tech greenhouse out before pulling the trigger on a bigger installation, <a href="https://www.rimolgreenhouses.com/">Rimol</a> makes some very reasonably priced greenhouses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other important thing about greenhouses is their construction and assembly. Many of the manufacturers do not install the greenhouses on your site, and will instead refer you to a contractor to do the work for you. Prepare for a lead time of several months on both the parts and construction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why go with a greenhouse? </strong></p>
<p>Greenhouses save a significant amount of money on operational costs. Greenhouses require significantly smaller light input, if any at all. This translates to equipment and maintenance savings. Additionally, if you grow in cold or dry climates, a greenhouse can easily increase the temperature or humidity of your grow operation. Over time, these savings add up and can cut your operational costs in half or more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenhouses can be built nearly anywhere, from Iranian deserts to Floridian tropics to the Arctic tundra. The only time a greenhouse might be a bad idea is if the area you grow in is prone to extreme weather events that would damage the greenhouse, such as large hail or extreme winds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Technology in a Greenhouse</strong></p>
<p>Your average person might picture a greenhouse as simply being a structure with glass windows. But there&rsquo;s all sorts of technology you can bring into it. You can add wetwalls, which are specially designed evaporative coolers. You can also have automatic irrigation, which <a href="http://www.dosatronusa.com/">Dosatron</a> or the <a href="http://www.priva.ca/en">Priva</a> system can provide. Systems from <a href="http://www.hortimax.com/">HortiMax</a> and <a href="http://www.arguscontrols.com/">Argus</a> are expensive, but can manage almost all aspects of your greenhouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are even new, experimental and robotic means of automation. The <a href="http://www.isogroepmachinebouw.nl/">ISO Group</a>, a company from the Netherlands, has created a robot that can make brand-new cuttings extremely rapidly. You merely feed it a branch, and the robot will quickly and efficiently make cuttings. Other companies, such as <a href="http://www.lemnis-oreon.com/en/home.html">Oreon</a>, are developing water-cooled lighting systems that circulate the heat that the lights generate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Future is Green</strong></p>
<p>I see greenhouses in the cannabis industry taking over. Within a few years you&rsquo;ll see very, very few warehouse grows being built. For the most part, I think that a lot of the warehouse grows will go out of business or convert. We&rsquo;ll always have some boutique growers that stay in the indoor model, because they&rsquo;re well-known and have a great product. But in all other situations, I see greenhouses taking over.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Armed with a doctorate in plant/environmental sciences as well as 25 years of governmental compliance experience, Dr. Chao-Hsiung Tung is in charge of cannabis testing at G3 Labs. Having worked at both Yucca Mountain and the Nevada Test Site, he not only brings his scientific expertise to G3, but also to the state’s Independent Lab Advisory Committee. Dr. Tung’s knowledge of the intricacies of government compliance made him an obvious choice to serve on the Clark County Commission’s recently created Green Ribbon Advisory Panel.

The most important message is that this is for adult-use and used for recreational purposes. When people say recreation, take that word to heart. One is not supposed to be stoned. Moderation is the key. We want our visitors to have a pleasant Las Vegas experience and come back frequently.

As far as testing, we analyze the cannabis and test for its potency and hold the safety line to ensure it’s not contaminated or harmful to users. On the compliance side, we are all under the umbrella of the Nevada law. We have NRS 453A of the Medical Marijuana Act to follow. Pretty soon, we will also have an adult-use law to follow. We envision they will pretty much be the same. The packaging and labeling, the contents, and the test results are all geared toward compliance and protecting the end-user.

Lab testing cannabis in the U.S. is in its infancy. How has Nevada done so far?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

When we started two years ago, testing in Nevada was a newborn baby. We have evolved a lot. We have become a toddler and we are learning to walk. We are actually walking pretty well so far. We have learned and implemented many measures to improve and enhance our program. But, all in all, the most significant lesson we have learned and are able to share with the rest of the country is during the implementation of the regulations you have to hold the safety standard. Right now Nevada holds the standard.

For other states that are working on establishing lab testing programs, what advice would you offer?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

For any state that has a new testing program, it needs to implement the testing program in the very beginning before everything is rolled out. It is difficult to start testing later because by then people have to relearn the culture. From the state’s viewpoint, for a new program to be successful, the labs have to be independent, technically capable, and there has to be adequate capacity to serve the market. Without enough capable labs, a backlog is created which lends to the possibility of sloppy testing and results in an effort to get caught up. When setting up a testing lab program the expected volume for that state has to be taken into consideration and organized with that in mind.

As an Independent Lab Advisory Council (ILAC) board member, what has the board brought to the state’s lab testing program?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

ILAC’s overall focus has been, of course, to assist the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health (Division) in sorting out and clarifying many regulatory compliance issues for the industry, such as the significant issues related to pesticide monitoring issues as well as parameters for dosage and serving size. ILAC basically gives advice, and makes recommendations to the Division on how to actually implement those regulations in detail.

What is the most important thing the Independent Lab Advisory Committee (ILAC) has been able to help the state implement? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

ILAC has worked with the Nevada Division of Public and Behavioral Health (Division) to include the Department of Agriculture in regulating pesticide use and testing. They are the authority and they have the expertise -- that’s number one and I think that’s a big one. They can regulate all the pesticides sold in the state and they also have the authority and expertise to go into any cultivation or any agriculture entity that’s using pesticides to do inspections. Also, we, on the ILAC board, advised and recommended that the state implement a round robin test, which is an inter-laboratory comparison. The state issues a sample and all the labs will test it at the same time, turn in the results then the state can evaluate our results, and identify the spread and if there are any outliers. We just started the first round, but it’s a landmark idea for the cannabis industry.

<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Our title is Independent Lab Advisory Committee, but it happens to be the only platform for the whole industry to voice any concerns regularly. So ILAC is not only the voice for the laboratories, we see ourselves as representing the whole industry and the public. Therefore, we are constantly soliciting ideas from across the industry and public and we recommend subjects for the agenda on how we can improve and enhance this program. In my personal view, the biggest issue on the table right now is how to continue holding the standard or enhancing the program to protect the end-user because, after all, public safety is number one. That never comes off the table -- that is always first.

Will the state require adult-use cannabis to be tested? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Yes it will be tested, and it should because a patient has the advantage of their doctors, their physicians or their caretaker monitoring their medication’s dose and effect; whereas the adult-use consumers have none. They usually rely on their own limited knowledge that rarely is based on education or any program support. With that in mind, if the adult-use program doesn’t have solid safety testing, or sufficient information to educate them, then the result will probably not be optimal. When people in the state voted for Question #2, it was with the idea that we can’t relax on public safety.

What has been the most surprising discovery about the cannabis industry?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

So many people not treating this as a real business surprised me. There are a certain number of people who are carrying the baggage from those shady days before legalization. They are not treating this as a legitimate business that must be operated in full compliance. I was astonished by that and there are so many individuals claiming they have experience in the industry and, yet, not able to perform up to the standards of our regulations.

Having taken the leap into the cannabis industry, is it anything close to what you expected?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEleven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

As a business owner, the answer is yes, but not as an individual. I was amazed by the number of people who are motivated by the hype -- thinking the cannabis industry is another Gold Rush and that they will be rolling in the money really fast, but that’s not the case. Just like any business, you need to have a business plan to run your company with solid investment and backing as well as operational and technical capacities. You have to ride it out because it takes a while to recover your investment and it takes a long while to see a real profit. It’s not a get-rich scheme. So far, the industry is on the right track and there are people who finally realized they can’t handle this and they either decided to give up and drop out or just sell their license.

<h2>West Virginia</h2>
West Virginia is on the verge of becoming the 29th state to legalize cannabis for medical purposes. SB 386, titled the West Virginia Medical Cannabis Act, received final approval in the West Virginia Legislature April 6th and is headed to the desk of Governor Jim Justice. He has publicly expressed support for legal access to medical marijuana and is expected to sign the bill into law, making West Virginia the 29th state to adopt an effective medical marijuana law. SB 386 charges the Bureau of Public Health with regulating medical marijuana growers, processors, and dispensaries. Patients with specifically listed qualifying medical conditions will be allowed to use extracts, tinctures, and other preparations of marijuana, but not marijuana in flower or leaf form. This differs from the original version of the bill and the medical marijuana programs in most other states.

<h2>NEVADA</h2>
On March 6th, Senator Tick Segerblom introduced Senate Bill 236, which would allow social use of cannabis in public places such as lounges, bars, coffee shops, and special events like fairs and concerts. SB 236 would allow local governments to issue permits to businesses and licenses for special events allowing marijuana consumption in designated places. Social use would be monitored locally and would only allow adults aged 21 and over to publically consume marijuana. SB 236 outlines clear regulatory instructions that social use venues cannot exist within 1,000 feet of a school, public park or playground, church, or anywhere that is otherwise viewable from a public place. If passed, SB 236 would become the first state law to address public consumption of marijuana.

<h2>GEORGIA</h2>
On March 30th, the Georgia Senate passed a bill, by a 45-6 vote, that would expand the state's limited medical marijuana law to include people with 15 medical conditions, up from nine currently. The bill now goes to Governor Nathan Deal to sign into law. Unlike many other U.S. states that have medical marijuana laws that allow smokable and edible forms of cannabis to be used by people who have a wide range of conditions, Georgia only allows cannabis oil for a limited number of maladies. The state Senate passed the expansion. The measure was already approved by Georgia's House of Representatives. Georgia's limited medical marijuana law was enacted in 2015.

<h2>CONNECTICUT</h2>
Newly formed Connecticut Coalition to Regulate Marijuana (CCRM) held a press conference March 7 to rally support for legislation that would regulate and tax marijuana for adult use in Connecticut. The event was held just prior to a committee hearing on H.B. 5314, sponsored by Rep. Melissa Ziobron (R-East Haddam), which directs the Department of Consumer Protection to establish a regulated system of marijuana cultivation and sales for adults 21 years of age and older. It also directs the Department of Revenue Services to create a tax structure that would generate revenue for the state and certain municipalities. Ziobron and the sponsors of three similar proposals — Senate President Pro Tempore Martin Looney (D-New Haven) and Reps. Juan Candelaria (D-New Haven) and Toni Walker (D-New Haven) — are working together to end marijuana prohibition in Connecticut.

<h2>DELAWARE</h2>
At the end of March, Representative Helene Keeley and Senator Margaret Rose Henry introduced HB 110, the Delaware Marijuana Control Act. The bill seeks to legalize and regulate cannabis for adults 21 years of age or older. The marijuana tax revenue would be used to fund education, public health campaigns, and to support re-entry campaigns for ex-offenders, among other programs. An October 2016 poll by the University of Delaware found that 61 percent of state residents favor policy change.

		<title>By Popular Demand The highs and lows of patient desire for THC-dominant strains</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Justin Alexander</h4>

<p>Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is responsible for the euphoric or psychoactive effects in cannabis, is currently very much in demand by Nevada&rsquo;s medical marijuana patients. For some, it&rsquo;s because THC gives relief to the severe effects resulting from PTSD and chemotherapy, nausea, neuropathic pain, and HIV/Aids.</p>
<p>Other, less educated, cannabis users seek out high THC strains because of the assumption that the more THC there is, the more bang they are getting for their buck. Or, perhaps, consumers have only heard of THC and so aren&rsquo;t familiar enough with cannabis&rsquo; other compounds to ask about the healing effects of cannabidiol (CBD) or terpenes.</p>
<p>While THC may be what first attracts patients to cannabis use in newer markets such as Nevada&rsquo;s, industry experts hope that the other cannabis properties and their benefits will eventually be better understood and considered more carefully by patients. &ldquo;Hopefully, as Nevada evolves and cannabis users become more educated, they will find increased value in terpenes and other cannabinoids (such as CBD),&rdquo; says Jeremy Francisco, analytical chemist at Nevada Organic Remedies.</p>
<p>Virtue Las Vegas&rsquo; lead cultivator David Holmes agrees, very succinctly summing up the nuances of understanding cannabis wholly with the following comparison, &ldquo;A 30-percent THC strain is about as interesting to a cannabis connoisseur as Everclear is to a seasoned small-batch single-malt Scotch aficionado.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The+Source&rsquo;s Kush Master Distillate</strong></p>
<p><em>THC: 82.8 percent</em></p>
<p>A vape cartridge for patients who want a high dose of medicine, Kush Master Distillate undergoes a process called fractional distillation in an effort to make its hue more appealing. &ldquo;During the development of the Kush Master distillate, the underlying goal was to remove the dark color present in the strain,&rdquo; Francisco says. &ldquo;As with most indica-dominant strains, the CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;extracted oil tends to have a chocolaty brown appearance. Unfortunately, the stigma surrounding concentrated oil is that a darker color indicates inferior quality, which is not the case. Nonetheless, we decided to use fractional distillation to remove the naturally occurring darker pigment of the strain by filtering out plant matter at a molecular level. As a result, what remains is a highly-concentrated THC value and a beautiful translucent yellow color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After using the Kush Master, it will be tough to fight off the zzzs, as it produces an almost immediate heavy, drowsy effect with just one puff. A guaranteed good night&rsquo;s sleep, it also provides management of deep and extreme pain and is recommended daily for experienced users who can withstand a high that is fast-acting and potent.</p>
<p>Casual users only need to consume a fraction of distillate compared to flower to achieve the same results. &ldquo;When using distillate for the first time, users should begin with small inhalations and space them appropriately in order to accurately gauge the product&rsquo;s effect before consuming more,&rdquo; Francisco advises.</p>
<p>In order to prevent paranoia and anxiety, some strains are now being bred with varying ratios of terpenes and cannabinoids to modulate high THC. &ldquo;Linalool, a very floral smelling terpene, is known to have anti-anxiety and antidepressant properties and Kush Master counteracts the effects of anxiety and paranoia because of its considerable linalool and diverse cannabinoid content,&rdquo; reports Francisco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kabunky&rsquo;s Gorilla Glue</strong></p>
<p><em>THC: 24.14 percent</em></p>
<p>An indica-dominant hybrid with a high THC level that glues you into whatever you need to do, Gorilla Glue, with buds that are thick and pillowy resembling clouds of moss with an earthy smell to match, helps with loss of appetite and shreds through pain and insomnia. It is a super relaxing high with strong body effects and is a great companion for binge-watching a favorite television program. Expect to drift in and out. One of the new classics, Gorilla Glue&rsquo;s earthy flavor is a must-try for those who love Diesel strains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are a variety of benefits from high THC products, I believe one of the best values, however, is the fact that you do not need nearly as much medication to receive those benefits,&rdquo; says Kabunky&rsquo;s Chris DeGraff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Polaris Wellness Center&rsquo;s Head Cheese</strong></p>
<p><em>THC ranges from 27 to 33 percent </em></p>
<p>Master Grower Peter Ishak spent seven years focused on creating the perfect hybrid with super intensity. The product of that passion is Head Cheese. This high-THC strain offers functional daytime pain relief and conversely, in the evening, acts as a sleep aide, submerging you into a deep REM sleep due to its high levels of myrcene. Ishak has seen both cancer patients and veterans seeking high pain relief receive tremendous benefits from this strain. &ldquo;We can manipulate any cannabis plant to deliver either indica-hybrid or sativa effects,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It really depends on the patient&rsquo;s physiology and how they receive [it].&rdquo; As for THC-dominant products, Ishak says, &ldquo;The strains in high demand have the highest THC&mdash;premium strains that patients [that are] functional and use as a sleeping aide if required. I know of only two strains in the Nevada market that patients are able to manage and control [their state as they see fit]and Head Cheese is one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pineapple Express Bakked Pure CO<sub>2</sub> Distillate</strong></p>
<p><em>THC: 89.44 percent </em></p>
<p>To meet the demand of Nevada's patients for high THC products, OrganaBrands responded by developing a distillate&mdash;one of the newest and most exciting forms of concentrates on the market&mdash;with superb taste and effect. &ldquo;The great thing about distillates is they are not only high in THC, but should also have a wide range of cannabinoids and terpenes that contribute to the overall medicinal value,&rdquo; says Margaux Hansberry of Bakked. &ldquo;You need less of a distillate to reach the desired effect and they are extremely versatile. You will truly feel the genetic potential of each strain in its highest concentrated form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new &ldquo;cannaisseur,&rdquo; Hansberry notes, is someone who is educated and understands &ldquo;what cannabinoid and terpene profile works best for what they are trying to treat. Some enjoy the presence of a terpene called caryophyllene to buffer the nervous head-high associated with high THC products. Sometimes, a nice puff of CBD will help curb those anxious or paranoid thoughts. Other people tend to stick to indica-dominant strains, staying away from terpenes like pinene and limonene which may cause anxious feelings. We've really honed in on hitting high myrcene levels which is most effective for pain relief and helps increase the maximum saturation level of the endocannabinoid system&rsquo;s CB1 receptors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sativa, Pineapple Express offers a knockout combination of both flavor and potency with terpene and cannabinoid profiles creating a surprising complexity that relaxes you in the best way possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Medizin&rsquo;s Banana OG</strong></p>
<p><em>THC: 29.8 percent</em></p>
<p>With the distinct buttery aroma of banana nut, Medizin&rsquo;s Banana OG minimizes stress from the very moment the jar is cracked open. Muscles melt and hunger begins, all while fighting off sleep, and, in some cases, a bit of dry mouth. After a hit of the indica-dominant strain, find yourself slipping into a relaxed, happy, and hungry state. But all of these effects aren&rsquo;t just because of a high quantity of THC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More THC=better could not be further from the truth,&rdquo; says Chris Wren, Medizin vice president and cultivator. &ldquo;As the market matures, the consumer base will begin to realize that it&rsquo;s not just about that total potential THC number, and more about the overall quality of the cannabis. The magic of the plant is the combination of all cannabinoids, terpenes and non-terpene biomolecules. Yes, of course, a 99 percent pure THC distillate will be potent, but it may not alleviate your insomnia as well as a 20-percent THC flower with two-percent myrcene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He points out a common THC misconception about paranoia. &ldquo;High THC does not necessarily equate to paranoia,&rdquo; Wren says. &ldquo;This misconception is derived from the clinical trials where pure THC was compared to THC+ other cannabinoids and terpenes. It is the THC by itself, isolated and alone, that was causing the paranoia. It is all about the total milligram intake of THC and entourage effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kynd Pure Critical Kush</strong></p>
<p><em>THC level: 78.3 percent</em></p>
<p>As pure as its name suggests, Critical Kush isn&rsquo;t mixed or cut with any other ingredients. It&rsquo;s pure CO2 oil with a full-bodied terpene profile from pure plant extract. When using Kynd Pure expect a relaxed, deep euphoria and an uplifted happiness. It definitely perks up the day and doesn&rsquo;t let you languish in the gray zone. Recommended for experienced cannabis users, the high THC does amplify the effects, helping guard against depression, insomnia, stress, pain and nausea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is evidence to suggest that products high in THC can help with conditions such as asthma, seizures, and tics associated with Tourette syndrome,&rdquo; according to Dr. Sean Devlin, who works with Kynd, and notes other benefits include treating and minimizing nausea, vomiting, muscle spasms, pain and insomnia, as well as stimulating appetite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cannabiotix WiFi OG</strong></p>
<p><em>THC: 32 to 34 percent, Delta-9-THC: 32 percent, THC-A: 35.9 percent</em></p>
<p>When developing WiFi OG, also known as White Fire, Cannabiotix was aiming for a winner in both strength and quality. &ldquo;Our underlying goal is to produce one of the strongest most knockout, gassy, spewy indicas possible,&rdquo; relays Head Cultivator Cory Calcagno. &ldquo;Seen as a traditionally finicky and more sensitive strain, we pay extra careful attention to our OG in the vegetative and flowering cycle to make sure we can get those polished off, diamond golf ball looking gems upon <br /> final harvest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Look for the WiFi to pack a major couch melt sensation. Definitely great for those suffering from insomnia or chronic pain, WiFi is a potent strain, packed with THC to counteract severe ailments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Virtue OG by Virtue Las Vegas</strong></p>
<p><em>THC: 26.37 percent</em></p>
<p>Full of OG-rich terpenes, experienced users will delight in Virtue OG as it can be described as inducing full relaxation mode. &ldquo;OG varieties in general are very fast acting and good for many ailments specifically insomnia,&rdquo; says David Holmes, Virtue Las Vegas&rsquo; lead cultivator. But, he notes, effects really vary between individuals. &ldquo;Every user has a unique but related endocannabinoid system that reacts to cannabinoids and terpenes differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holmes also emphasizes the importance of production and breeding to maximize terpenes as well as the entourage effect of the whole plant, something that Nevada consumers will come to understand as their palates and knowledge develops. Holmes draws an important comparison to liquor distillation, concluding with an apt analogy, &ldquo;A 30-percent THC strain is about as interesting to a cannabis connoisseur as Everclear is to a seasoned small-batch single-malt Scotch aficionado.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>BY JeffThe420Chef</h4>
<h5>Photography by Leela Cyd</h5>
<br>
<br>
<h2 style="margin-top:50px">Hazy Thai Wings</h2>
<p>Dubbed the Julia Child of weed by the <em>Daily Beast</em> and the Ganja Gourmet by <em>Newsweek</em>, JeffThe420Chef is known for inventing the process which neutralizes the herbaceous taste of cannabis in edibles and is a pioneer of "layered micro-dosing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff first started cooking and baking with cannabis for a friend&rsquo;s mother who was ill with cancer. Passionate in the belief that cannabis is a gateway to a better quality of life, Jeff teaches individuals how to create hand-crafted, strain-specific light tasting and tasteless canna-butters and canna-oils. Jeff has authored a new cookbook <em>&ldquo;The 420 Gourmet: The Elevated Art of Cannabis Cuisine&rdquo; </em>specifically created to achieve health and wellness goals and teach people how to dose edibles properly.</p>
<p>Calling his Hazy Thai Wings an ode to Pok Pok, Jeff said, &ldquo;the first time I had authentic Thai wings was at Pok Pok Noi in Portland while visiting chef Adrian Hale of Communal Table. I fell in love! All I could think about for days was how to recreate these awesome wings with one (or two) added ingredients. Now I am sharing it with everyone. You&rsquo;ll never look at wings the same way <br /> again, guaranteed!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
½ cup raw cane sugar
½ cup Asian fish sauce
3 Tablespoons ketchup
1 ½ Tablespoons chili garlic sauce (Sambal sauce)
1 Tablespoon fresh lime juice
1 teaspoon rice vinegar
1 cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon garlic powder 
2 pounds chicken wings, rinsed and patted dry
Extra Virgin coconut oil
½ cup canna-coconut oil
4 Tablespoons cilantro, chopped
toasted peanuts and garlic (see sidebar)


<h3>Directions:</h3>
<p>Place sugar in a food processor and grind until very fine. In a medium bowl, add fish sauce, ketchup, sugar, chili garlic sauce, lime juice and rice vinegar. Set aside.</p>
<p>In a shallow dish, sift cornstarch and garlic powder. Toss the wings in the cornstarch mixture to coat.</p>
<p>Heat a large skillet on the stovetop for 1 minute on high. Add enough coconut oil to fry -- about 2&rdquo; from the bottom of the pan. Fry the wings until golden brown. Remove with slotted spoon and drain on brown paper.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 340&ordm;F. Place fried wings on a lightly greased baking sheet and drizzle each wing with 1 teaspoon of cannaoil. Bake for 7-8 minutes.</p>
<p>In a clean skillet, add the sauce. Heat on medium until syrupy, about 5 minutes. Remove wings from oven and toss with the sauce until evenly coated. Toss in toasted peanuts and garlic. Garnish with cilantro and serve alongside a cup of carrot sticks and celery curls.</p>

</br>


<h2>Toasted peanuts and garlic</h2>
<h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
¼ cup raw peanuts, crushed
4 cloves garlic, chopped
1 teaspoon coconut oil

<h3>Method:</h3>
<p>In a small bowl, mix peanuts and garlic with coconut oil and a dash of salt. Spread evenly on a small pan and roast at 325&ordm;F for 30 minutes until toasted and browned. Remove and let cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Celery Curls: Cut celery into six-inch pieces, slice in half lengthwise, make lengthwise cuts almost to center and repeat to create slivers. Refrigerate in ice water until slivers curl and voil&aacute;!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Approximate dose per serving*</p>
<p>10%: 10mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 15%: 15mg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20%: 20mg</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: *Approximate dose per serving is basen using 5 grams of cured/</p>
<p>dried/decarbed herb into 5oz. of coconut oil.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A droopy eyelid. That was the first sign that something was wrong with Kristin and Toby Bowker&rsquo;s three-week-old baby, Bella. &ldquo;The pediatrician thought it was normal newborn stuff,&rdquo; explained Kristin. &ldquo;They found missing tissue in her eyes and told us she would have no vision or low vision. We had genetic testing right afterward and it came back fine and they concluded the eyes were an isolated event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t. At two months old, Bella started having seizures. It took about a month before Bella&rsquo;s doctors offered a diagnosis of Aicardi Syndrome, which is a rare genetic malformation syndrome characterized by the partial or complete absence of a key structure in the brain called the corpus callosum, the presence of retinal abnormalities, and seizures in the form of infantile spasms.</p>
<p>From that point, the Bowkers began a crash course of learning which pharmaceuticals would be best for treating Bella&rsquo;s condition &ndash; from Sabril to ACTH. Then they had to make a decision about whether or not to put their infant on a ketogenic diet, which is a strict low-carb diet, similar to the Atkins diet or LCHF (low carb, high fat).</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw an initial decrease in her seizures in the beginning but she still had seizures every one or two hours,&rdquo; said Kristin, noting they went on to try approximately six seizure medications.</p>
<p>The Bowkers had never considered cannabis until Bella&rsquo;s vision therapist mentioned Dr. Sanjay Gupta&rsquo;s CNN &ldquo;Weed&rdquo; documentary during an in-home visit. &ldquo;As soon as she left, I watched the show. After seeing that, we had to research and figure out if it would work for our daughter,&rdquo; explained Kristin.</p>
<p>In addition to finding solid research, for the couple to feel comfortable giving their toddler medicinal cannabis, the Bowkers turned to their faith. &ldquo;God has used a plant he created to do incredible things,&rdquo; explained Toby Bowker of cannabis. &ldquo;The research shows that we all have an endocannabinoid system in our bodies that God created for a medicine,&rdquo; Kristin continued. &ldquo;So knowing that, for me, it was a very easy decision. The endocannabinoid system helps boost the immune system in our bodies, alleviates pain, and helps to cure us where pharmaceuticals are not always effective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even though the Bowkers lived in Nevada where medical cannabis has been legal since 2000, the medical dispensaries weren&rsquo;t open when they began their search for medical cannabis for Bella. &ldquo;They were still a year to year-and-a-half out from opening,&rdquo; recalled Kristin. &ldquo;So our options were to grow it ourselves because there was no CBD oil in Nevada, get it from California&rsquo;s dispensaries and bring it back, or move to California to get access to it. But when we started looking into going back and forth we realized we couldn&rsquo;t be drug traffickers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The couple decided moving to California to access cannabis legally was their best option. That obstacle overcome, the Bowkers still had to maneuver through an industry that didn&rsquo;t understand the value of CBD cannabis oil quite yet. &ldquo;We definitely had our challenges finding legitimate CBD oil,&rdquo; said Kristin, who would take every bottle they purchased to Oakland for testing since at the time California didn&rsquo;t require cultivators to lab test their cannabis. &ldquo;Three years ago dispensaries would say it was high CBD oil but it would be half the milligrams they said it was or there were only residual amounts &ndash; it was all across the board,&rdquo; offered Kristin.</p>
<p>Once they found oil with the correct strength, the next hurtle was getting the dose right. &ldquo;Our doctor held our hand each step of the way and told us about possible interactions when we started her on CBD. We instantly started weaning the pharmaceuticals. Then we started seeing a weird interaction so we were dealing with that,&rdquo; said Kristin. &ldquo;In the beginning, it was this weird balancing act, juggling the pharmaceuticals and CBD and watching her for response. Then we added in THC-A and then a little THC because we weren&rsquo;t seeing enough progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the challenges they encountered were worth it because the Bowkers saw a 75 percent decrease in Bella&rsquo;s seizures, noting that with Aicardi syndrome it would be rare for her to be completely seizure-free. &ldquo;For the first time, she slept through the night,&rdquo; Kristin enthused of the results they saw from cannabis, adding, &ldquo;She was three years old before she slept through the night and she&rsquo;s come down from five mediations to just Sabril and Keppra.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three times a day Bella receives 100 milligrams of CBD through her g-tube. The cost for her CBD oil is $1300 a month but to the Bowkers every drop is worth it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will respond to us with sounds or with her eyes now,&rdquo; Kristin said of Bella who will be six years old in June and has taken cannabis oil for three years. &ldquo;Bella is awake and alert like she has never been before.&rdquo;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
</br>
<p>Pregnancy is a special time in a woman&rsquo;s life, eliciting feelings that span from one extreme to the other &ndash; including everything from feeling that pregnancy glow to having morning sickness to suffering from pregnancy blues. For the 12 percent of women who face challenges such as nausea and depression during pregnancy, finding ways to cope can be a challenge <br /> in itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tell patients to avoid any nonessential medications during pregnancy. The reason I do this is because for most medications, we really don&rsquo;t know how they will affect the baby. This includes over-the-counter medications such as cold medicines and ibuprofen and Tylenol, all probably safe, but research is still showing conflicting evidence.</p>
<p>It is impossible to do a randomized controlled trial on medications used during pregnancy because of the ethical limitations of exposing a fetus to a potentially harmful substance. Most of the research performed is either based on patient reported use or animal studies, both of which are unreliable, at best. The same goes for medical marijuana (MMJ). There is a serious lack of evidence for the safety of MMJ which has led major medical bodies like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Medical Association (AMA) to recommend that physicians dissuade patients from using cannabis during pregnancy. Although the evidence is seriously lacking, there is some theoretical basis for the recommendation.</p>
<p>Our body&rsquo;s natural cannabinoids, like Anadamide, activate the endocannabinoid system and play a role in everything from inflammation and hormones to influencing our brain function. There is also evidence it plays a role in the developing brains of fetuses. It is certainly possible that extra stimulation of the endocannabinoid system by exogenous cannabinoids like THC, could disrupt the normal development of the brain. This has been shown in animal studies, but again those are unreliable for predicting effects in humans.</p>
<p>There have been a few studies that attempted to see if there is actually any noticeable difference in children who were exposed to cannabis in utero, using patient reported data. What they found is that ADHD symptoms may be affected in school-aged children. Longer term studies have shown no difference in IQ, though it has shown some disruption in visuospatial abilities. Many of the differences disappeared as the children got older.</p>
<p>There is also evidence that exposure to marijuana showed an increased risk of the baby developing anemia as well as lower birth weights and intensive care stays. What is unclear is that if any of the effects can be attributed to cannabis only. These studies do not account for the possibility that other factors like alcohol, tobacco and other drugs could cause these problems as well as socioeconomic factors such as access to prenatal care, vitamin supplementation and proper nutrition.</p>
<p>So if we don&rsquo;t know what the effects could potentially be, why would we even consider using cannabis during pregnancy? One of the most well studied benefits of cannabis is the treatment and prevention of nausea. Nausea and vomiting occur in 50-90 percent of all early pregnancies. For most women morning sickness can be annoying, if that is what you call throwing up your breakfast for a few months straight, but tolerable. However, for about three percent of women, morning sickness known as hyperemesis gravidarum (HG), becomes an all-consuming parade to the bathroom for the entirety of their pregnancy and causes dehydration and weight loss that can be harmful to a developing fetus.</p>
<p>The standard treatment for HG is medication. The safety studies of these medications only look at the risk of major malformations, which cannabis has also never been shown to be associated with. It is unclear why the standard for what constitutes harmful is different for cannabis and pharmaceuticals. The evidence of fetal harm from cannabis consumption during pregnancy is minimal at best yet the AMA and ACOG still recommend against it. They instead recommend drugs that have never been subjected to any study on the long-term effects on children. There have been observational studies on the effectiveness of cannabis in HG and the effectiveness was overwhelmingly positive. More rigorous research needs to be performed to determine the effectiveness of cannabis.</p>
<p>SSRIs are the standard treatment for depression in pregnancy and millions of women use them despite the fact that their utility outside of severe depression is limited. It is not currently recommended to stop using SSRIs during pregnancy because the risk of suicide has been deemed more concerning than the risk of doing harm to the baby. Studies have shown that many anti-depressants do increase the risk of congenital malformations, especially in the heart. Cannabis helps many people with their mood and could be effective in the treatment of depression without the risk of birth defects.</p>
<p>Taking any medication during pregnancy is a touchy issue. The fact is we really don&rsquo;t know much about the long-term effects that most medications have on our children. Most safety studies only look at whether or not babies are healthy at birth and not what the long-term effects might be. Ultimately parents must make the decision for themselves about how much they are suffering and if they are willing to accept the risks of taking a medication that may or may not affect their baby. Cannabis, like all drugs has some risk, right now we don&rsquo;t know how big that risk is but, by all accounts, it appears to be minimal. As medical cannabis becomes more and more ubiquitous in our culture, we will have more information to work with and perhaps we will have a clearer answer in the near future.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a Mother&rsquo;s Day that goes by that I don&rsquo;t find myself in tears. I could have lost my child. This could have ended up being a more malignant tumor, she could have died before she was two, her brain surgery could have gone bad, the staph infection she had at one point could have spread to quickly and could have killed her. My child could be feeling around in the dark right now, she could be completely blind, she could have onset puberty, there are so many things that could have happened to my baby,&rdquo; an emotional Tracy Ryan, 42, recounts with a catch in her voice as she lists off just a few of the medical maladies her four-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Sophie, has endured.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>IT BEGINS</strong></p>
<p>Tracy Ryan&rsquo;s nearly five-year journey of hospitals, doctors and cancer treatments began on June 23, 2013 when an 8-1/2-month-old Sophie was diagnosed with a low-grade, Optic Pathway Glioma brain tumor. The first clue something was amiss had only happened three days earlier when Sophie had an MRI scan after nystagmus, or shaking of the eyeball, presented in her left eye.</p>
<p>Sophie&rsquo;s tumor was diagnosed as slow growing so doctors recommended that Ryan and her husband Josh start their daughter&rsquo;s treatment with an observational period to watch and wait for two-and-a-half months and see if the tumor stopped growing and even regressed. During that time, &ldquo;we started her on a very low dose of cannabis, a 2:1 THC to CBD ratio, and we were hoping maybe, just maybe, we would get lucky and she would have no need to do chemo because thinking about putting that kind of toxicity into an eight-an-a-half-month-old is earthshattering for a parent,&rdquo; recalls Ryan. &ldquo;We started her very slowly so she didn&rsquo;t feel any psycho-activity and she never had any negative side effects from the cannabis at all, she was smiley, and happy and hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nystagmus in Sophie&rsquo;s left eye started to go away so the Ryans stopped giving her cannabis oil because they thought the tumor was shrinking. But, unfortunately, the tumor hit a very aggressive growth spurt and it was growing toward the back of her brain and putting pressure on her optic nerve causing the nystagmus to start growing again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After another MRI, the brain surgeon told us Sophie was going to lose her vision, that her left eye would be completely blind and her right eye would be grossly compromised. The best case scenario was to prepare ourselves for full blindness. He told us there was 100 percent chance this would happen because chemotherapy would not shrink her tumor fast enough to release the pressure off of those nerves to save her vision,&rdquo; recollects Ryan.</p>
<p>Sophie&rsquo;s doctor decided to biopsy her tumor to ensure it wasn&rsquo;t a more terminal tumor based on how fast it had grown. Ryan asked what the doctor meant by more terminal and &ldquo;he said if this comes back as a more malignant tumor your child won&rsquo;t live to see her second birthday. We were devastated, not only were they going to take a huge chunk of her skull off, but we were also now faced with the possibility of teaching our small child Braille and finding a blind school for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ryans moved forward with the biopsy, of which, doctors took the very smallest piece that pathology would allow because the tumor was wrapped around Sophie&rsquo;s nerves and brain. Luckily, the news was good and it ended up not being the more aggressive tumor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>SEEING THE LIGHT</strong></p>
<p>Before Sophie started the 13-month regimen of chemotherapy doctors recommended following the observation period, the Ryans opted to titrate up the cannabis oil to a bigger dose. From the very first scan the Ryans saw results. &ldquo;The doctors were very surprised because they said if we were going to see shrinkage, we shouldn&rsquo;t expect to see it on the very first scan and we got incredible results on that very first scan and we continued to see incredible results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our daughter sees incredibly well. We do believe she may have some color deficiencies because that&rsquo;s the first thing to go when the nerves are starved but to look at her and watch her interact is to watch a normal child. She may have some slight deficiencies but we can&rsquo;t tell yet because she is so young but, for all intents and purposes, she sees fantastically and she is nowhere even remotely close to a child that is blind or even has severe detriment to her vision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ryan attributes Sophie&rsquo;s success in beating back cancer to a combination of cannabis and chemotherapy. &ldquo;It really is the entourage effect between those two and where we have seen so much synergy. We have always used them together, in concert with one another. The science is not there yet for people not to use Western medicine. Western medicine can work and save lives, it&rsquo;s the toxicity that you really have <br /> to worry about. But if you can keep the patient healthy <br /> and eating and thriving, which cannabis does, then their <br /> body is so much stronger and so much more capable of fighting cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Sophie has taken cannabis oil since she was nine months old, her tumor has recurred twice since the resection on her brain when she was a one-year-old. &ldquo;We believe there are new mutations in there, we hope that this formulation will be strong enough to work even better and in concert with her existing medications that she is taking for even more profound success,&rdquo; says Ryan, who adds she has been busy trying to find answers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THE BIRTH OF CANNAKIDS</strong></p>
<p>Tracy Ryan has indeed been very busy, not only finding answers as she navigates her daughter&rsquo;s road to recovery, but also sharing what she has learned about cannabis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a secret I couldn&rsquo;t keep in good conscience as a parent and continue to let other parents go through these horrifically toxic treatments without letting them know there is an option that could potentially help their child stay healthier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ryan decided to share the secret in the best way she knew how. As an owner of a social media and branding agency, her background in marketing made it easy for Ryan to start a California-based advocacy company called CannaKids in March 2014 and get the word out. &ldquo;I saw a vacuum in that market, I saw there wasn&rsquo;t enough quality educational guidance or medical professionals,&rdquo; Ryan relays of cannakids.com. &ldquo;I believed this was a path I was supposed to be on and felt like I needed to dedicate everything I had in bringing this plant to the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ryan had only two goals when she started CannaKids. The first was to find a cure for her daughter. The second was to conduct pediatric clinical trials. She needed for the second to happen in order to achieve the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My daughter is the driving factor in what we are doing with CannaKids -- trying to find her a cure or at least something that can help get her off of these medications. We want to stop her from having anymore bumps in her road,&rdquo; Ryan explains, continuing, &ldquo;because we are so focused in helping her, we are doing anything we can to partner with the world&rsquo;s foremost researchers and hospitals and, in turn, all of these other children and families are benefitting from this because we are not just studying Optic Pathway Gliomas, we are studying all cancers. We are studying all indications when it comes to pain and nausea, migraines and fibromyalgia, autism and epilepsy, and because this one child was sick we are now working toward helping anyone that this medicine can serve.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although Ryan has her goals in sight, she and Sophie still have some work to do. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t know what the right strain is for Sophie, we don&rsquo;t know what the right combination of cannabinoids, terpenoids and flavinoids are in order to target those genetic mutations in her tumor to stop them from feeding it but we are getting close,&rdquo; says Ryan, who took a sample of Sophie&rsquo;s tumor to Israel in April 2016 so her genetic mutation could be studied. &ldquo;The research scientist had to do a genome sequence of that tissue to see what mutations existed in that cancer sample. Now they are sourcing those exact same mutations and they will rebuild her cell type in their lab and they will then run it through a machine. They have sequenced over 450 strains of cannabis in Israel and they will run all of these different strains against her tumor sample to find the one that will kill her sample and destroy that cancer. Then they will be able to look at that strain and understand what formulation in that plant is responsible for that cell death and that recipe could be 15 ingredients or less. They will then hand me that recipe and I will work toward recreating that recipe here in our own lab and we can break the plant apart and reassemble it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once the research is finally completed, &ldquo;We will try this on Sophie and she will be the first human patient in the history of the world, as far as I know, to have a cannabinoid medicine designed especially for the mutations in her brain,&rdquo; explains Ryan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the potential of what is possible in reach, Ryan and her team at CK Sciences are in the beginning stages of partnering with one of the top pediatric hospitals in the country to do seven different clinical trials in live humans. &ldquo;We are in the planning stages with one of the top hospitals in the country for peds trials and the goal of these doctors and research scientists is not just to work on these seven indications, but for this to be a starting point for us. Once we show efficacy post-trial, eventually we will find a way for cannabis to work for every single disease in the hospital,&rdquo; she explains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>GETTING IN THE OIL BUSINESS</strong></p>
<p>In addition to trials and scientific research, Ryan also wanted to implement ideas she had for refining medicinal cannabis and its delivery method so in March of 2015 CannaKids rolled out its own line of medicinal cannabis oils. Her team started &ldquo;by diluting it down with MCT oil, it helps with absorption levels and the cannabinoids because cannabis is fat soluble,&rdquo; Ryan says of CannaKid&rsquo;s line of oils and tinctures. &ldquo;Additionally, our scientists have designed a profile of natural organic all-natural flavoring with a slight taste of bubble gum and grape for our oils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As for the delivery method CannaKids uses, Ryan says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much easier, we just have a little reducer cap in the top of our bottles and you stick a syringe into the center like a Tylenol bottle. You turn the bottle upside down and just pull out the dose you need. You give the dose and they chase it with some sort of fruit juice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Using cutting edge research from the trials in combination with Ryan&rsquo;s business savvy, the future of CannaKids has the potential to make a huge difference in a lot of lives. &ldquo;In my opinion, with the trajectory we are on now, we are going to become a brand that&rsquo;s known for medicine that truly works for specific indications. Our goal is to become the foremost leader in pediatric and adult disease by rolling out a product line based on research that is specific to a patient&rsquo;s genetic makeup to the mutations in their body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It can be overwhelming to listen to Ryan as she extends her knowledge -- from trials and genome sequences to fractionated coconut oil and ketogenic diets but remember she, too, was once like any other parent just starting to navigate a child&rsquo;s new medical diagnosis and treatment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We knew nothing about lab testing, we knew nothing about different profiles, we knew nothing about terpenes, we were clueless beyond clueless. Trying to find information about cannabis was impossible because it just didn&rsquo;t exist and that&rsquo;s one of the reasons we started Savingsophie.org,&rdquo; says Ryan of the foundation she also started. &ldquo;At savingsophie.org we have this incredible resource center with cannabis studies so you can find a 100 different research articles and papers along with other educational blog pieces that talk about cannabis and what it does, how it treats different diseases and the science behind it. It&rsquo;s much easier to find information now but it hasn&rsquo;t always been and we wanted to take that pressure off of families who are looking for answers and are already dealing with so much stress and agony of having a very sick child or loved one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody knows that utter feeling of helplessness better than Ryan. &ldquo;If I had a choice and I could go back and do it all over again, I would always choose for Sophie to be healthy. But to have the silver lining we have had and been given so many gifts along the way, I am truly grateful to God and to everyone who has helped us to get here and all the people who came before us and all that they have passed down for there to be research on the medicine that has helped my child. I feel like I am living in a dream most days, I truly do. And it&rsquo;s one that I am happy to wake up to as long as my kid stays healthy.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Opioids vs. Cannabis</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Pouya Mohajer, M.D.</h4>
</br>
<p>The Nevada State Legislature is currently considering whether or not to add opioid addiction as a qualifier for a patient medical marijuana card. Senate Bill 228, sponsored by Senator Pat Spearman, proposes that physicians be allowed to recommend cannabis use as a treatment for opioid addiction. (<em>Editor&rsquo;s note</em>: SB 228 was amended into SB 374 and passed out of the Senate Judiciary committee on April 12.)</p>
<p>As the bill snakes its way through the two legislative houses over the next several weeks, state lawmakers will need to decide its validity with the big question being: Can medical cannabis help reduce opioid abuse by treating pain and ameliorating adverse symptoms and cravings during withdrawal periods?</p>
<p>But first, let&rsquo;s review where we are with regard to the nation&rsquo;s opioid crisis. In 2012, over 2.1 million people in the US were addicted to prescription opioid medications while an additional 467,000 people were addicted to heroin.<sup>1</sup> In 2015, there were over 20,000 overdose deaths related to prescription opioids and almost 13,000 overdose deaths related to heroin.<sup>2</sup> Four out of five new heroin users started out misusing prescription opioids.<sup>3</sup> In a 2014 survey of people in treatment for opioid addiction, 94 percent of the respondents said they switched to heroin because prescription opioids were more expensive and harder to acquire.<sup>4</sup> In states that have passed medical cannabis laws, there is a significant decrease in opioid overdose mortality rate (25 percent decline), a lower number of prescriptions written for opioids, and a reduction in opioid-positive test screens in fatal car crashes.<sup>5-7 </sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opioids produce a sense of well-being and pleasure by stimulating the regions in the brain associated with reward. Opioid addiction is a chronic disease and needs to be viewed as such.&nbsp; As with other chronic diseases, opioid addiction relapse back into drug abuse is very probable.&nbsp; Just as hypertension and diabetes require ongoing treatment, so does opioid addiction. More often than not when relapse occurs with opioid addiction, many consider the treatment a failure.&nbsp; Compare this to a patient on medications for hypertension or diabetes whose symptoms improve while on medication but relapse once medication is stopped. Negative emotional states and cognitive disturbances are two characteristics of addiction which can trigger craving and relapse, thus contributing to the vicious cycle of opioid abuse. Therefore, a successful treatment for opioid addiction requires a dynamic process where continual evaluation and modifications are necessary.</p>
<p>Current treatments for opioid addiction target detoxification, withdrawal symptom management, and psychological counseling. Pharmacological treatments directly target the opioid system.&nbsp; These medications also have their own challenges such as abuse potential and strict governmental regulations. Alternative pathway medications are necessary to battle the opioid epidemic and the addiction that ensues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If opioid intake is abruptly ceased, patients tend to undergo withdrawal symptoms (pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertension, tachycardia). It is important to administer medications to alleviate these adverse effects thus easing the craving and physical symptoms which can trigger a relapse. Pharmacological treatments include agonists (methadone), partial agonists (buprenorphine), and antagonists medications (naltrexone). Pharmacological therapy in conjunction with psychological support programs provides the best results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cannabinoids are a class of chemical compounds that act on the cannabinoid receptors in different cells in the body and exert their action via altering neurotransmitter release in the brain and other substances in other cells. The two major cannabinoids found in cannabis (phytocannabinoids) are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). THC tends to be rewarding and can enhance sensitivity to other drugs. CBD, on the other hand, has a low reinforcing profile with limited abuse potential and it appears to inhibit drug seeking behavior.&nbsp; Furthermore, CBD decreases stress vulnerability and reduces anxiety.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a bit of clinical research to support use of medical cannabis to treat opioid addiction involving human subjects. In the limited small human studies, CBD reduced heroin related cravings in heroin abusers.<sup>8</sup> In preclinical animal models, there appears to be a slight trend supporting the benefits of CBD in treating aberrant behaviors associated with addiction as well as alleviating withdrawal symptoms. A study with animal models using CBD resulted in improved opioid withdrawal symptoms as well as lessening heroin seeking behavior.<sup>9,10</sup> In another animal study, CBD curtailed the reward-facilitating effect of morphine. The authors hypothesized that CBD interferes with the brain reward mechanism, thus CBD may diminish the brain reward functioning effects of opioids.<sup>11&nbsp; </sup></p>
<p>Currently most medications utilized to treat opioid addiction directly target the endogenous opioid system. Medical cannabis and/or some of the plant's cannabinoids, such as CBD, could offer an alternative line of therapy that can alter opioid-related behavior, which can lead to reduction of adverse effects associated with current addiction treatment strategies. Given the potential to reduce withdrawal symptoms associated with cessation of opioid intake and the potential for treatment of opioid addiction, as outlined in SB 228 now 374, I believe opioid addiction should be added to the current qualifying medical conditions where medical cannabis can be used.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2009, entrepreneur Greta Carter began her career in the cannabis industry. Having left the worlds of banking and real estate, her skills transferred easily to the new industry which was just starting to be regulated. A former VP at Citibank with an expertise in start-ups, Greta founded multiple businesses in the cannabis space including Hope Clinics, Life Gardens, and Cannabis Training Institute. During her entrepreneurial endeavors, she became a nationally recognized cannabis activist and consultant applying her depth of knowledge of business and corporate disciplines to guide others in the cannabis industry.

I believe we are all on a journey, and that journey is laid out for us. I was at a point where I was affected financially, just as many people were in 2008 and 2009, and it was an opportunity for me to reinvent myself. So with cannabis having been in my life, but only in the closet, since I was 18 I was really not ready to come out loud and proud until my son encouraged me to check out the industry and see what was going on in Northern California. Only after meeting many leaders in the industry and speaking with them, did I understand that this was really a medicine and had healing qualities to it and was bringing a lot of relief to people who didn’t have other sources to go to for it. That was a crossroads in my life that was my destiny. It showed me I could help speak up for the people who can’t and it just emboldened me and my passion, creating a path of no return.

It wasn’t attractive, it was awfully scary. What has evolved since then have been the disciplines that are built around a highly regulated industry such as banking and real estate. Those disciplines have transitioned really nicely into a legal cannabis market which is all about regulation, safety and being transparent so the transfer of my skills really prepared me for the success I am enjoying now.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Back in 2009 when you said cannabis that was a real far left wing, crazy person proposition. You just didn’t talk about it openly like you do today. There were no sources, no cannabis events, no educational materials, very little on the Internet, not a lot was understood about cannabis at that time. It was a real subculture where people were growing cannabis deep in the woods or in the basement and they were, rightfully so, paranoid about talking about it. Then you look at a 50-something Republican woman coming out about cannabis -- I presented a very different face to cannabis and the passion I spoke about before really emboldened me to walk into state legislators’ offices and start having a conversation with them. I was completely amazed and still am at how open their doors were to hearing what I had to say so that really got my political path started and I helped to write and educate people about the new legislation that was about to come out in Washington.

In my career at Citibank they trained me to start businesses. So one thing I really know how to do and do well is bring organization to chaos. I am all about starting businesses and then two or three years later, when they are successful, transferring those to whomever I am partnering with or selling them. That is the path I am on for cannabis, I want to help people who want to get into this industry. I want to share with them the lessons I have learned along the way. I want to build that discipline and regulation that I have learned throughout my career into the cannabis industry so it becomes normal and profitable for people and it becomes another product just like any other agricultural product out there.

<div class="panel-body">

There are still so many myths out there. There are still people who want to talk about cannabis as a gateway drug that leads to a spiraling down in life. I don’t know how they are not seeing what’s really happening with it and seeing thousands and thousands of patients, year after year, telling their stories of how they are getting off of their prescription drugs and how their quality of life has been improved. Those stories just keep me motivated and fired up to keep going forward. Cannabis Institute Training, which I sold two years ago, was my attempt to break myths from all of the propaganda out there by offering quality training.

<div class="panel-body">

Hands down, there is no question we are displacing workers who for decades earned their income and put their kids through college and bought homes and everything else with money earned from cannabis. I am highly sensitive to that, and know we need to make sure we can transition that workforce into the legitimate market. As for Big Pharma, there has been an ongoing struggle with pharmaceuticals and natural herbs for as long as I can remember. We have groups like APHA (American Public Health Association) that has been out there for 30 years embracing cannabis as just another herb. Many groups see it as something that is natural and something that should be available to people for a balance in their life or for an alternative to pharmaceuticals.

Owners David (Goldwater) and Chris (Olsen) reached out to me when they first started considering seriously getting into the cannabis world in Las Vegas. Because David and Chris didn’t come from that environment, they knew they needed a cannabis expert on their team. They were having a hard time finding someone with that balance between business and cannabis. I was an anomaly who had both the business sense and background into the cannabis world so it was a good balance and a good fit for them. We helped with the application, we do that really well, we win licenses. We won the three that Chris and David are on with me. Then we helped get them started and transferred that knowledge and passion about the plant to their staff. Now David and Chris run the operations and I am there for consulting and support.

</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I hope I have been able to shift the paradigm by taking the approach with lawmakers and law enforcers of presenting a model that makes them proud and they can stand behind their decision to let cannabis be a part of their community. I like to keep that bar high to lessen their fear about what we bring to the communities and to turn that fear around to the point of them not only being welcoming, but proud of the decisions they made that brought us to their community. I think Inyo is a really good example of that – giving back to the community and having patient levels and standards that are high.

</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Yes, absolutely. They really do overregulate us at first. We saw that happen up in Washington, and we saw that start to happen in Nevada, and it’s starting to happen in California. But having been here for a while, that’s okay if they overregulate us because if that’s what makes them comfortable in the community then so be it. Being at the forefront of a movement that is becoming an industry, it is our path to embrace those regulations and go through the process and laws our country is built on to something more reasonable. One good example is Washington, they put a 75 percent tax on cannabis, and if that’s what it takes for us to get it legal then let’s take the 75 percent. Then the next time it came around, we were able to reduce it to 37 percent. That’s just progress.

</div>
<div id="collapseTen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

The biggest surprise is also my biggest disappointment, which is the realization of how far behind our political machine is from where the people are. We have gotten overwhelming support for cannabis as a medicine and almost as much support for it to be adult-use but, yet, we have got this crazy machine out there trying to breed fear into people whether it’s the DEA regarding Schedule I or the DOJ. One example is our banking issues and the bizarre filing of our taxes because of cannabis being 280E and a Schedule I drug. Also, there is still the idea that some politicians rank it up there as being as dangerous as heroin. As a citizen of this country, I am really concerned that our elected officials are not truly representing the people who voted for them. So that is a surprise to me and it still continues to be.

Every one of them have progressed normalcy for this plant, and each one has built on the last one. Today, what I do is consulting work with High Road Consulting. I am really honored that I am at a point where I can transfer the knowledge that I have gained and the lessons that, in some cases, have beaten me down and made me stronger in others. I think it’s been a beautiful journey and accumulation of all of the businesses I have started that has led me down the path to High Road Consulting.

<div id="collapseTwelve" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

There’s a fallacy out there that there’s tons of money to be made in cannabis and that it’s really easy money. Yes, the math looks really good but for smart, traditional business people you can probably make more money easier in other businesses. We are a brand-new industry so you must find the tenacity somewhere in your heart to stick it out because the rules and regulations are developed in almost real-time so it can be frustrating and so very expensive when those rules change rapidly. So come to this industry with enthusiasm, but also with the knowledge that you can’t give up when things get difficult.

		<title>Compost Teas: Taking Compost to the Next Level</title>

<p>This month&rsquo;s Grower&rsquo;s Spotlight focuses on compost teas with input from cultivation experts Jason Stirling of SPARC Dispensaries, Scott McBride of Global Garden Supply, and Steve Storch of Vortex Brewers.</p>
<h3><br /> <strong>What are compost teas?</strong></h3>
<p>As the name suggests, compost teas start with compost, which is an excellent source of nutrition for plants. However, plant nutrients are typically locked away inside large, complex organic molecules. Microbes in the compost break down complex molecules for plants to easily absorb.</p>
<p>Compost teas, often shortened to just &ldquo;tea,&rdquo; are part of a new approach to plant nutrition and soil inoculation, where, rather than letting the microbial community develop by chance, growers deliberately inject microbes and nutrients into their grow medium with compost teas. By nurturing microbial growth, compost teas improve the effectiveness of traditional compost.</p>
<h3>Why should a grower use compost teas?</h3>
<p>According to Jason Stirling of SPARC, there are a few reasons why a compost tea is better for growing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compost teas will give you trace minerals you won&rsquo;t find in basic NPK nutrients.</li>
<li>Extra nutrition unlocks otherwise unavailable genetic traits because the plants are less stressed.</li>
<li>In the long run, you save money because you only have to buy the teas to meet your plants&rsquo; nutritional needs, rather than seven or eight different nutrient products.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teas are about taking resources you&rsquo;ve spent time and money on and maximizing their effect, says Scott McBride of Global Garden Supply. They help your process and allow you to get the most out of your plants, whatever medium they&rsquo;re in:</p>
<ul>
<li>The oxygenated water from a compost tea can help colonize beneficial microbes, allowing them to grow and multiply.</li>
<li>The beneficial microbes unlock minerals in the compost, particularly minerals that might not be present in the soil.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What are the drawbacks to growing with compost tea?</strong></h3>
<p>Stirling believes:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need tea brewing on-site. That means you need the physical space to brew the tea, and if you&rsquo;re in a tightly packed facility, that may not be feasible.</li>
<li>Brewing on-site also means you need the equipment to brew such as water tanks, power sources as well as an air supply, which costs money up front.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Storch of Vortex Brewers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes you will want a compost or nutrient input that&rsquo;s impractical to acquire locally. It will cost money to get it shipped to you.</li>
<li>Brewing adds another job to the workload. It takes extra time out of each day.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Take us through the brewing process.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;We have a brewer big enough for one 24-hour cycle. As a result, we&rsquo;re constantly brewing. As soon as we drain it, we fill it right back up and renew it. Since we&rsquo;re using a vortex style of brewer, we only need to clean the tank once every six months. It doesn&rsquo;t get foul,&rdquo; explains Stirling, continuing, &ldquo;The key is to store your inputs at optimum temperatures. The temperature affects the vitality and speed of the brew. Your tea brewers and tea should be kept at a constant temperature, never hotter than 90 degrees Fahrenheit, with an ideal of 75 degrees Fahrenheit.<br /> &ldquo;As far as a delivery system goes, you can directly tether your brewer into an injector system or irrigation lines. You can also hand water with the tea. Once we have the concentrated tea brewed, we mix the tea with water at a 1:9 ratio.&rdquo;<br /> Storch of Vortex Brewers cautions, &ldquo;When the tea is ready and brewed, apply it as you normally would. Just be careful when spraying the mixture. You want to keep your pressure below 30 PSI if possible. What you&rsquo;re spraying is living tea. If you&rsquo;re using 110 PSI, what comes out the other end probably won&rsquo;t be alive anymore. It would be a little microbe Armageddon.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><br /> <br /> <strong>What results have you seen using compost teas?</strong></h3>
<p>&ldquo;The first time I used tea, I got extra hairs on my plants,&rdquo; recalls Stirling. &ldquo;The plants also had more vigor and produced more flower than normal for that strain. I saw stress resistance improve. The plants could tolerate harsher conditions. Pest management got easier as well -- the amount of powdery mildew and bugs decreased. It really helped with the overall health and vigor of the plant. I also saw higher cannabinoid levels. As a grower, you want anything that can increase your cannabinoids.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We usually get phone calls from people who have visited a friend&rsquo;s grow operation and were blown away by their results,&rdquo; explains McBride. &ldquo;Many of our customers have shared similar experiences where they saw plants nurtured back to health, seemingly from the dead.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>NEVADA</h2>In mid-May, the Nevada Tax Commission adopted temporary regulations proposed by the Department of Taxation allowing the state to issue recreational marijuana licenses by July 1, 2017. The ballot measure that passed on November 8 requires the state to initiate sales by January 1, 2018, but this “early start” program will allow businesses to open six months sooner. Only medical marijuana establishments that are already in operation can apply to function as recreational retailers during the early start period. The establishments must be in good standing and pay a one-time, nonrefundable application fee as well as a specific licensing fee. The tax department accepted applications from May 15 - 31, and a second application period is anticipated later in the year. The incentive for the early start program stems from Gov. Brian Sandoval’s proposed budget request, which includes $70 million from recreational marijuana taxes over two years to support education.

<h2>NORTH DAKOTA</h2>
Medical marijuana bill SB 2344 continues to work its way through the North Dakota Legislative Assembly. Voters overwhelmingly voted 63% to 36% in favor of establishing a medical marijuana program last November. The current version of the bill allows whole plant cannabis and other preparations, but does not permit extracts or edibles. Advanced practice nurses will now be able to issue certifications to patients, though 18 year olds will still need their parents’ permission to enroll. The bill, sponsored by Senator Rich Warden, would eliminate the tightly controlled home cultivation provision that was included in Measure 5, along with the petition process to expand the list of qualifying conditions. However, terminal illnesses will be added to the program, along with critical legal protections originally missing from the voter initiative.

<h2>IOWA</h2>
The Iowa Senate Appropriations Committee introduced a bill to establish a comprehensive medical cannabis program in the state in April. The bill would allow patients suffering from cancer, PTSD, intractable pain, and a host of other aliments access to this treatment option if their doctors certify them for the program. The bill would not allow patients to smoke cannabis, but patients could still vaporize or consume their medicine in other forms. Between four and 12 manufacturer licenses would be issued by December 1, 2017. By April 2, 2018, the department would issue 12 dispensary licenses. As a condition for licensure, a medical cannabis dispensary must agree to begin supplying medical cannabis to patients by July 16, 2018. The dispensaries would be located based on geographic need throughout the state.

<h2>VERMONT</h2>
On May 10, the Vermont Legislature became the first state legislature in the nation to approve a bill that would make marijuana legal for adults and send it to a governor’s desk. However, in late May Vermont Governor Phil Scott vetoed the bill. Though Scott said he views the issue "through a libertarian lens," he vetoed the bill due to concerns about detecting and penalizing impaired drivers, protecting children, and the role and makeup of a Marijuana Regulatory Commission. Governor Scott said he is "not philosophically opposed" to legalization, "and I recognize there is a clear societal shift in that direction." Scott said he'll send recommended changes to the Democratic-majority legislature, and that if they address his concerns, "there is a path forward on this issue." He specified a handful of changes that would need to be made for him to support the measure and said he believes the legislature has time to incorporate them and enact a revised version during the summer veto session.

<h2>WEST VIRGINIA</h2>
On April 19 West Virginia officially became the 29th state to pass medical marijuana legislation when Governor Jim Justice signed it into law after the bipartisan bill passed both the Senate and House. Beginning in July 2019, qualifying patients whose doctors have issued them a written certification for medical cannabis will be allowed to register with the health department to use and buy medical cannabis from regulated dispensaries. Patients may qualify for medical cannabis if they have a terminal illness or if they suffer from cancer, HIV/AIDS, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord damage, epilepsy, neuropathies, Huntington’s disease, Crohn’s disease, PTSD, intractable seizures, sickle cell anemia, or severe, chronic or intractable pain. The only types of medical cannabis allowed initially will be pills, oils, gels, creams, ointments, tinctures, liquid, and non-whole plant forms for administration through vaporization.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It has been said that golf is &ldquo;a good walk spoiled.&rdquo; For countless &lsquo;duffers&rsquo; dedicated to the game, it&rsquo;s also a lot like pizza, even when it&rsquo;s not great, it&rsquo;s still better than a day at the office. It&rsquo;s a simple endeavor in theory; you start over here with these clubs and hit that little white ball into that hole over there. Anyone who has given it a try knows it&rsquo;s not easy, no matter what course you play.</p>
<p>At Royal Links Golf Club, which sports a collection of 18 of the greatest holes in the history of the British Open, the challenges and rewards are on another level. Perhaps a higher plane is the correct term, since the East Las Vegas course is throwing weed into the mix. The state is gearing up for legal marijuana these days, and Royal Links is the first course in Nevada to get in on <br /> the action.</p>
<p>Guests can now openly light up as they lay up, and the term &ldquo;on the green&rdquo; now means more than one thing. So how does one fare in this pairing of golf and ganja? Depends on your skill level, and how high you want to take things. We broke the round into three-hole blocks and paired them with a diverse selection of flower from The+Source Dispensary in Las Vegas. What follows is one man&rsquo;s descent into reefer madness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Holes: 1-3</br>Strain: Sativa, Zeta by Cannibiotix</br>Score: +8</strong></p>
<p>First up is the Par 4 re-creation of the tenth at Royal Lytham. It gives you an indication of just what the course has in store, surrounded by undulating mounds of green, unruly rough and very little tree cover (make sure to bring proper headgear and sunscreen. Nothing blows a good buzz like skin cancer). The Zeta is strong, almost caffeinated. So far, I&rsquo;m hitting greens in regulation, but little jitters from the power-packed cannabis are forcing some three-putts. After a double par on the Par 3 third, I&rsquo;m wondering if I can make it through the round.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Holes: 4-6</br>Strain: Hybrid, Sin Mint Cookie by Nevada Organic Remedies</br>Score: +16</strong></p>
<p>The Par 5 fourth hole, inspired by the sixth at Royal Liverpool, is very reachable in three, unless you only golf a few times a year and are lucky to put two good holes together per round. The current smoke is now a hybrid, which brings the intensity of the last strain down a bit and makes for a smooth backswing off the tee. I can see the bumpy fairway ahead of me but it takes me a moment to actually find the green.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Holes: 7-9</br>Strain:&nbsp;Sativa, Lemonburst by Cannibiotix</br>Score:&nbsp;+28</strong></p>
<p>As I double par the Par 5 ninth, someone approaches. OMG, is that a walrus driving the beer cart&hellip;? <em>Coo coo cachoo!</em>&nbsp; Who said that? The Lemonburst has turned my internal monologue into an echo chamber as I roam the tall hill looming over the green at the ninth. Wait, how did I get to the ninth? I stumble for the scorecard only to see that I only bogeyed the Par 3 eighth. No, that is not a walrus. It is a very nice lady who asks me if I need anything and tells me that this is her last turn. I take that to mean the last turn around the front nine and politely decline. She is never seen again. Will I suffer from a similar fate?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Holes:&nbsp;10-12</br>Strain:&nbsp;Hybrid, Gorilla Glue #1 by Polaris MMJ</br>Score:&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t Ask</strong></p>
<p>(Seriously, what course pulls their refreshment cart mid-afternoon on the first day of Spring? I&rsquo;m starting to get some serious munchies.) The 10th hole is the famed &ldquo;Road Hole&rdquo; of St. Andrews, where John Daly won in 1995. At the 11th I realize the beer cart isn&rsquo;t the only thing missing. Over the hills I go, to the opposite hole. Ahhh, there it is. Confident as a gorilla sniffing glue, I strike it back into its proper fairway. As I hole out on the green, I catch a glimpse of a golfer looking round the spot where I had hit from. I then look at the ball I just holed. It is not the ball I started the hole with. Oh well, stoner golf, right? Time to hop in the cart and keep moving!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Holes:&nbsp;13-15</br>Strain:&nbsp;Hybrid/Infused Pre-roll, Chemdawg X Ringo <br /> by KYND</br>Score:&nbsp;Huh?</strong></p>
<p>Normally, I love a beer on the course, but all I can think of now is WATER. The complimentary bottle I found in the cart when I arrived is almost empty, and I am parched from cotton mouth. Currently in the &lsquo;dope&rsquo; phase of my own rope-a-dope, although this isn&rsquo;t faking, I lunge for the last tee in my cart, which now has to last me for the final four holes. As I approach the 15th green and reach for my putter and&hellip;oops. It&rsquo;s a goner. I grab the flag pin and lie on the green to sink the best putt of the day working it like on a pool table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Holes:&nbsp;16-18</br>Strain:&nbsp;Hybrid(high CBD 1/1 ratio), Pennywise by Nevada Organic Remedies</br>Score:&nbsp;REALLY???</strong></p>
<p>I pivot from the 17th (Royal Troon&rsquo;s 17th, where Tom Watson won his fourth of five British Opens) to the 18th and spot the clubhouse in the distance&hellip;HOPE! An end to this madness now in sight, it makes me almost as giddy as the surprisingly adept bogey I pull off at the 16th. It&rsquo;s a replica of the 15th at Carnoustie, and reminds me of Jean van de Velde in the final round of the 1999 Open. He collapsed there at the 18th in one of golf&rsquo;s most stunning meltdowns (seriously, go look it up on YouTube). The Pennywise has me pound foolish, sluggishly pounding sand as I navigate inside and out of bunkers with walls so high, you&rsquo;d feel safe leaving young children in them while otherwise occupied. The grand finale 18th is a St. Andrews chestnut, with a giant abyss directly in front of the green which promises to swallow up any errant approaches or castaway golfers looking to be rescued from their own folly. I survive, eking out a double bogey, and as I walk away from this day, it occurs to me that I have lost balls, I have lost a putter and I may have lost my mind. I know that I may not remember any of it, but I will always remember that I could never remember the unmemorable, and I will always cherish <br /> that memory. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Author&rsquo;s note: Special thanks to The+Source Las Vegas for supplying the brain-melting, pre-rolled selections. And thanks to Royal Links Golf Club for a great day, if not of golf, of&hellip;something. Oh, and for getting me back my putter! </em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Richard S. Gubbe</h4>
<p>which item has more value in the marketplace? An ounce of trichomes (those tiny crystals that grow at the end of a hair-like extension on cannabis), or an ounce of gold (that&rsquo;s right, real gold)? Hint: At last glance, gold was $1,275 an ounce or $41 a gram.</p>
<p>Time&rsquo;s up. The trade would have to be two-for-one to be fair. There&rsquo;s twice the gold in them there plants. A gram of solely trichomes would be worth upward of $100 per gram and soon consumers will be seeing trichomes sold as pure kief to the rich man or woman at the low-low price of $120 a gram.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t even think about the staggering conversion to silver. Trichomes are attached to the flower or extracted for use in hash products, edibles and concentrates. Like flakes of gold, they are the most lucrative part of the cannabis business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All you need is some static electricity and a fine screen and you&rsquo;re left with the heads of what we call &lsquo;cannabis caviar,&rsquo;&rdquo; explains cultivator Don Decatur of Serenity Wellness LV.</p>
<p>He described to <em>elevate</em>&nbsp;how this precious, minute sack of goodies that protrudes from the plant delivers most of the punch. As a manufacturer, Decatur has overseen the process of trichome extraction for several Las Vegas-based medical marijuana establishments (MMEs).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sold pure trichome heads for $70 a gram (wholesale) and retail $140 a gram,&rdquo; Decatur says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen it as high as $200 a gram.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Natural extraction provides the lowest yield. He explains that butane hash will yield a 15- to 20-percent return, &ldquo;but less than one percent for trichome heads only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That staggering figure translates to 500 grams of flower for five grams of trichomes, which explains the price. &ldquo;When you think about it, that makes trichomes one of the more valuable substances on earth -- like gemstones,&rdquo; Decatur says.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Frosty the Trichome</strong></p>
<p>Plant trichomes come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and cellular composition. Trichomes of the cannabis plant have been divided into two types, glandular and non-glandular. Glandular trichomes produce and store large amounts of cannabis resin that includes THC, CBD and terpenes. Female plants are particularly rich in glandular trichomes. Although they are mainly associated with the flower structure, they  can also be found on leaves and stems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trichomes are the key ingredient in everything cannabis,&rdquo; says Kendall Smith, a local extractions specialist and product developer. Trichomes comprise the components that nurture the therapeutic and psychotropic properties and put the word medical in front of cannabis. These glandular structures serve as the home base for where the biosynthesis of cannabinoids takes place as the plant  is maturing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trichomes are the sticky part of its structure in the head,&nbsp;the gland. If you compare a CBD plant to any  other THC-dominant strain, the CBD plant trichomes grow right on the surface of the plant. Their gland structures are different,&rdquo; says Smith, who values the importance of keeping the trichome structure intact for whole-plant therapy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shoulda Studied Botany</strong></p>
<p>Glandular trichomes mature into bulbous trichome heads atop the hair, and differ in size and texture in various cannabis strains. For a THC-dominant strain, a hair extends from the plant, then a gland begins to protrude at the top. The most abundant concentration of trichomes can be found on bracts of pistillate (female) plants. The capitate-stalked trichome forms what looks like a mushroom head. These capitate-stalked trichomes are the primary source of the cannabinoids, terpenes, and other plant oils. Capitate-stalked trichomes develop only after flower formation and grow 15 to 30 micrometers.</p>
<p>There are bulbous trichomes that do not produce or house large amounts of cannabinoids or terpenes. The capitate-sessile trichomes have a globular-shaped head. These mostly grow on stems and leaves. Capitate-sessile trichomes produce cannabinoids throughout the plant&rsquo;s life cycle, but at much lower levels than capitate-stalked trichomes.</p>
<p>Glistening white trichomes seen in close-ups of the mature plant show the oil in its early state of clear liquid. Then it progresses to a cloudy state. As the plant continues to mature, a change in the color of the glands&rsquo; head turns to a light gold or yellow. At the end of the growth cycle, the color turns to amber, then brown as the plant dies. But flowers on the plant don&rsquo;t all bloom at the same time so there are always trichomes in different stages of development.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the trichome matures, it turns slightly cloudy, then yellow and amber. We look for 50 percent amber and 50 percent cloudy,&rdquo; says Decatur.</p>
<p>Trichomes need magnification, up to 40x, to view them. But from afar, they can have that frosty look if the plant was picked at the right time and was grown and dried properly. At close examination, you can see the trichome protruding from the flowers that glisten in the light. This overall view gives the bud a frosty look, hence the term frosty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To Extract or Not Extract</strong></p>
<p>Natural extraction of trichomes is now the rage with hand-pressed techniques all the way up to butane extraction. The yield is lowest when extraction is chemical free, which is reflected in the price.</p>
<p>Medical clients tend to spend less than recreational users, Decatur says, and with adult-use sales coming online this summer, the higher-end clients will emerge. Those high-end products extract one percent of trichomes from 99 percent of the plant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s tough for me to convince ownership when butane hash yields 15 percent,&rdquo; says Decatur, 33, a native Las Vegan who worked for BAM and is now head of cultivation for Oasis Medical, the umbrella company to SinCity Oilers (extracts) and UrbnHerb (flower).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extracting trichomes can be costly and it cuts into flower supplies,&rdquo; Decatur says.</p>
<p>While the majority of trichome heads are found growing out of the bud, many trichomes are found inside the bud as well as the leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t get a chance to stand up and be erect and don&rsquo;t capture the light quite as well,&rdquo; Decatur says. &ldquo;The ones on the outside shine a little more and contain 90 percent of the oil. That&rsquo;s where you would get the most out of it. They lend themselves to solvents that liquify the resin gland to remove the oil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remaining matter will still contain trace cannabinoids and terpenes within the plant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can use the remaining material for something that doesn&rsquo;t require terpenes like edibles,&rdquo; Decatur says.</p>
<p>Trichomes are unique from each strain of cannabis. Some of the hash strains have a thicker wax coating. Rosin is a fairly newer technique that uses heat and pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want stuff that melts and vaporizes much faster and liquifies,&rdquo; Decatur says. &ldquo;But some of the best trichome strains aren&rsquo;t good for hash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Characteristics of trichome heads and stems also vary between indica and sativa strains. The difference between the two can alter the type of screen used to separate trichomes from the plant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need to protect them during the drying process,&rdquo; Decatur says, offering that you need to &ldquo;know how to handle the plant or it lowers your THC score.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most potential for strong profiles comes from proper handling of the plant after harvest, notes Decatur, &ldquo;You see a lot of trichomes knocked off in the process that are decapitated glands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Old Dryer Trick</strong></p>
<p>Remember that episode of &ldquo;Weeds&rdquo; where Silas Botwin gets free bags of trim, then puts them in a clothes dryer to make hash? Silas was ahead of his time.</p>
<p>Smith, 36, who has worked in the cannabis field for half of his life or an eternity in MME years, is the production manager at Unifern LLC. He has learned growth and extraction practices from ground to table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;During 18 years of dealing with cannabis, we didn&rsquo;t do a lot with our trim,&rdquo; Smith tells <em>elevate</em>. &ldquo;A lot of it was thrown away. The value of trim leaves has grown over the past decade since people learned that, &lsquo;hey, I can make something from this.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Methods of extraction are changing as machinery changes and innovation occurs. From hand-rolled extraction of hash to beating bags of flower to BHO (butane) extraction, trichomes are harvested, melted, stripped or just thrown into edibles and hash products.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best trichome product is a ball of hash,&rdquo; says Smith, noting he is a purist.</p>
<p>While employing sound growing practices can make the difference in a cannabis plant profile, the strain can determine whether it is best for flower or for hash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see more breeding of hash plants,&rdquo; Smith says. &ldquo;Plants that produce big, fat resin heads. It all starts in the plants. There is only so much we can do in production.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some say with slight agitation, trichomes can become brittle and break off the plant, resulting in less overall cannabinoid and terpene content. An old wives&rsquo; tale, perhaps, unless the plant is abused. Smith and Decatur believe the trichome is tougher than it looks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;With a full-melt product like rosin, you are extracting in a way that preserves the profile with the least amount of chemicals,&rdquo; Smith says.</p>
<p>Trichomes also play an important role in the survival of the plant. The sticky resin substance is a defense against the sun, fungus and insects, as well as little herbivores. The glandular resin heads also act as a natural sunscreen. Combined with the aroma of certain terpenes, the plant can repel invaders. Abused plants may not have a strong terpene fragrance due to a loss of trichomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How Chief Keef Got His Name</strong></p>
<p>Pronounced keef or kif, depending on the cultural attachment, can translate to &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; or &ldquo;intoxication&rdquo; and refers to the collection of sand-colored resinous trichomes that stick in jars and plastic baggies. Kief is sifted from cannabis flower or leaf trim with a mesh screen or sieve. The accumulation of these trichomes creates a fine, powdery substance that is sticky as a result of the oil. Kief can be smoked by itself, added to flower, and lit or vaped, and can be pressed into hash or rolled with oil into temple balls or with flower to make moonrocks (see story on page 22).</p>
<p>The easiest way to collect kief at home is by using a three-compartment grinder. The cannabis can be finely ground from the top to the second compartment. The tiny trichome heads, or crystals, fall through a fine screen and collect into a small compartment at the bottom.</p>
<p>To accumulate enough to utilize in a bowl or press into hash takes hundreds of grams of flower. The result is a much higher concentration of psychoactive cannabinoids and terpenes.</p>
<p>For centuries, kief has been pressed into cakes of hashish or rolled into temple balls. Smoking kief alone or atop some flower can have a profound effect. Temple balls, moonrocks and other similar products contain full profiles of plants and an impacting high.</p>
<p>To collect larger amounts of kief, makeshift sifters using layered screens are created. Using a sifter box and a coin can assimilate mining for gold. Collecting small amounts of kief is easy; extracting large amounts of trichomes from flower is not.Whichever way you choose, the result is golden.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Justin Alexander</h4>

<p>Looking to add a space-age kick to your smoking experience? One option is Evergreen Organix&rsquo;s Moonrocks which has a powerful amount of THC at 45 to 60 percent available in one gram sizes. Moonrocks are crater-shaped mossy delights that make for a premium treat when you want to take an interstellar journey to reach a galaxy far, far away.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with the concept of moonrocks, it is flower, soaked in CO2 oil and rolled in golden kief, which is the sand-colored resinous trichomes that stick in jars and plastic baggies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moonrocks are great for patients seeking a higher THC product without having to dab,&rdquo; says Jillian Nelson, operations manager, Evergreen Organix. &ldquo;Moonrocks can be smoked like typical flower but take a little longer to burn because they are denser than normal due to the oil content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the most interesting attributes of Moonrocks is that they sizzle a bit as they burn. They can be loaded into a bowl or added to a joint and represent indica, hybrid, or sativa blends. So, if you know what you like, Moonrocks will keep you in your vibe.</p>
<p>This is a great product to add a big boost for those days that call for maximum pain relief, anxiety alleviation and an all-around great feel. Because they are very high in THC, Moonrocks are best enjoyed by experienced smokers.</p>

		<title>Tikun Olam brings its brand of wellness to Nevada’s patients</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Repairing the world -- that&rsquo;s not only the meaning of Tikun Olam&rsquo;s name, but also its mission statement. Although it might sound lofty, Israeli cannabis company Tikun Olam has both the research and studies to back it up as well as the world&rsquo;s largest database culled specifically from the observational study of cannabis.</p>
<p>Unlike the US, where the study of cannabis is challenged by a Schedule 1 status, &ldquo;in Israel we have the ability to research and study cannabis so that over time we have developed our medicine specifically to be engineered toward alleviating pain and giving relief,&rdquo; explains Tikun Olam&rsquo;s Chief Marketing Officer Stephen Gardner. &ldquo;Products from Tikun Olam are designed to improve quality of life, which is where the repair the world comes back into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tikun Olam initially opened in Israel as a non-profit in 2007 to serve patients via nursing clinics. The program was staffed entirely by volunteers who grew and prepared cannabis for patients ranging from veterans to seniors with cancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our focus as a non-profit was working toward and creating this network of nursing clinics to truly understand that this plant has tremendous medicinal benefits,&rdquo; relays Gardner. &ldquo;At the same time, they were developing the world&rsquo;s largest database to work toward understanding the symptoms medical patients have and how they could <br /> modify these cannabis strains to improve those symptoms and assist medical patients with help on conditions that range from neurological epilepsy to PTSD to cancer.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The research paid off. After years of development and genetic engineering, in 2012 Tikun Olam bred the first ever high-CBD, low-THC strain named Avidekel. &ldquo;Our team was working toward the educational and medicinal aspects of these strains. In addition, by understanding the full entourage effect and its true value, Tikun only reintroduces the same plant terpenes profile back into all of its extracts and doesn&rsquo;t use any cutting agents like other companies do,&rdquo; explains Gardner. &ldquo;We are truly finding through this research that the whole plant has the best effect and that&rsquo;s why we have employed that philosophy throughout our entire product line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In April, Tikun Olam started selling its product lines which include flower, vapes, topical creams, tinctures and lozenges in Nevada&rsquo;s dispensaries -- not only bringing Avidekel, but also five other key strains. One of the most revolutionary strains in the Tikun catalogue is Midnight, created on a balanced 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD, likely to be popular among those looking for a daytime, mild effect. Other strains include Alaska, a high-THC sativa, known for its uplifting and invigorating qualities, to several high-THC indica strains that include Erez, Or, and Eran Almog, known to be exceptional for pain management and the relief of various health conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tikun is now in Nevada bringing its research-backed strains that have been engineered and researched to alleviate a wide variety of ailments that Nevadans might be suffering from,&rdquo; explains Gardner, who concludes, &ldquo;we truly are a wellness brand.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>GB Sciences announces initial harvest</strong></p>
<p>GB Sciences, Inc. has processed its first harvest at its cultivation facility in Las Vegas. When fully operational, its cultivation facility will house 7,200 cannabis plants under 600 grow lights within 28,000 square feet. According to a May 15<sup>th</sup> press release, GB Sciences expects to generate approximately $10 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had the distinct honor and pleasure of personally making the first cuts from our first harvest last week,&rdquo; said GB Sciences CEO John Poss in the release. &ldquo;I was struck that in doing so I was not just cutting into a leaf or stem, but rather that I was cutting into the bias and blindness that has for so many years kept such an important palliative as cannabis away from the millions of patients who need it. We are the biopharma company of the future, because we are informed by science, but inspired by patients.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Essence Vegas commemorates first year with donation to Veterans Village</strong></p>
<p>In celebration of its first anniversary, cannabis dispensary Essence Vegas gave back to the nation&rsquo;s military veterans. Using donations that were collected in its three locations during the last year, Essence Vegas presented a check of approximately $14,500 to Veterans Village Las Vegas, a transitional and permanent housing residence dedicated to help veterans in need get back on their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are humbled and honored to accept this generous donation, which will help us fund our Veterans Village Emergency Housing and our 24/7/365 Crisis Intervention Center Fund,&rdquo; said Arnold Stalk PhD, founder of Veterans Village, located at 1150 South Las Vegas Blvd. in Downtown Las Vegas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been fortunate enough to not only provide medicine for numerous patients who are veterans of the United States military, but to have several veterans in the Essence Vegas family. As a company, Essence does not accept tips; we accept donations for veterans. The individuals at Veterans Village have sacrificed so much for or freedoms and we&rsquo;re honored we can help them get back on their feet,&rdquo; said Armen Yemenidjian, CEO of Essence Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Zen Leaf Vegas opens in southwest valley</strong></p>
<p>Located in Las Vegas&rsquo; southwest valley near Southern Hills Hospital, Zen Leaf Vegas dispensary has opened at 9120 W. Post Road, suite 103. Carrying a range of edibles, topicals, concentrates, pre-rolls and flower, Zen Leaf Vegas offers customers a unique way to purchase their medicine. Patients are able to select each of the buds from their favorite strains and those will then be weighed and packaged right in front of them. <em>zenleafvegas.com</em>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As licensed dispensaries plan to open their doors to sell recreational marijuana on July 1, it is not without a last-minute hangover in the form of a court case brought by the Independent Alcohol Distributors of Nevada (IADON) against the Nevada Department of Taxation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After filing a temporary restraining order against the Nevada Department of Taxation on May 30 prohibiting it from enforcing a May 31 license application deadline for marijuana distribution licenses, IADON made their case in front of Carson City Judge James Wilson on June 19. Today Judge Wilson handed down his ruling in favor of the alcohol wholesalers, granting them a preliminary injunction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crux of the case began with IADON filing a complaint on May 30<sup>th</sup>, arguing that the November voter-approved ballot measure, known as Question #2, which legalizes cannabis in Nevada, gives liquor wholesalers exclusive rights to marijuana distribution licenses for the first 18 months of sales in the state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although alcohol wholesalers were to have exclusive distribution rights according to the language in Question #2, in mid-March the Department of Taxation opened the licensing application process to the marijuana industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opening that distributor license up to everyone gives them a monopoly, and I don&rsquo;t believe the voters voted in a monopoly. It would allow them to become vertically integrated and handle everything from start to finish and none of us believe that&rsquo;s what the people voted in when they said regulate marijuana like alcohol,&rdquo; said Peggy Arquilla, IADON member and president of West Coast Wine &amp; Spirits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department of Taxation opened licensing to the marijuana industry because of concerns that there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough alcohol wholesalers to service the industry. Arquilla disputes that. &ldquo;In reality one or two liquor distributors have more capacity to service 100 or 200 customers and the fact that there were 30 who expressed interest, we can all just kinda do the math and I think that answers that question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the May 15-31 application process, 93 applications were turned in for marijuana distribution licenses -- five were from liquor wholesalers and 88 were from existing medical marijuana establishments, according to State of Nevada Tax Department spokesperson Stephanie Klapstein.</p>
<p>As a result of Judge Wilson&rsquo;s ruling this afternoon, the 88 applications turned in by the marijuana industry will be set aside leaving liquor wholesalers as the only ones eligible to handle distribution of recreational marijuana beginning July 1.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The majority of the distributors I know are even much larger operations than I am and have scalable businesses, they already have refrigeration, they all have refrigerated transportation and inventory control systems. It&rsquo;s just a matter of mirroring those same logistics,&rdquo; said Arquilla of being ready to distribute next month.</p>
<p>Massimo&nbsp;<em>D'Arrigo</em> of Bevi Beverages agreed, &ldquo;We have everything in place, our operation is extremely simple.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Damian Solomon, Director of Cultivation for MedMen, who has worked for some of North America&rsquo;s largest hydroponic greenhouse operations and was the NAFTA region greenhouse expert for international vegetable seed company DeRuiter Seeds shares his experience in the cannabis field. </em></p>
<p>I got my start in the cannabis industry by consulting for several of Canada&rsquo;s largest LPs (Limited Partnerships). I currently manage cultivation operations for MedMen, a Los Angeles-based cannabis management company. I started growing because I love growing and have a passion for it. I&rsquo;ve been involved in the high-tech, controlled-environment agricultural industry for close to 20 years.</p>
<p>MedMen is a company with the express purpose of mainstreaming marijuana by fundamentally changing the way cannabis businesses are capitalized, built and managed. MedMen is headquartered in Los Angeles, but we manage grow operations on behalf of license holders in several locations, including locations near Reno, Nevada, and the Sun Valley area of LA.</p>
<p>When we build cultivation projects, we select locations based on many factors, such as the availability of natural resources like sunlight, water, and elevation. We prefer to build high-technology glass greenhouses. However, in a warehouse-retrofit situation, we can optimize indoor operations by incorporating modern agricultural technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>The 101 of MedMen Operations</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>How many different plants are you growing?</em></strong><em><br /> </em>The actual number of plants will vary depending on the square footage of each facility. Generally speaking, our flowering density is 2.0 plants per square foot. Vegetative density is 8.0 plants per square foot, and our clone density is 39.0 plants per square foot.<br /> We choose strains based on customer demand and qualities such as aroma, flavor, yield potential, and shelf-attractiveness. We understand the importance of meeting customer demand and are always looking at new strains for our R&amp;D trial section. Currently, we have a set of eight core strains we are working with.</p>
<p><strong><em>What&rsquo;s unique about your growing style?</em></strong><em><br /> </em>Our designs are based on commercial hydroponics, using our proprietary nutritional recipes. We do not use pre-blended, hydroponic store fertilizers. We produce our own fertilizers at a cost of $0.40 per gallon, using our own nutrient recipe for all life stages. <br /> We also utilize Integrated Pest Management (IPM) protocols. We believe that early detection, coupled with the use of natural predators, is the best way to catch issues early and mitigate problems without using harsh chemical pesticides. Monitoring and controlling plant/leaf temperature, especially in the hours before &ldquo;sunrise,&rdquo; is a key tool for controlling mildew and molds</p>
<p><strong><em>What kind of equipment are you using?</em></strong><em><br /> </em><strong>Automation:</strong> There are very few tasks performed by hand in our facilities. We are always looking for ways to incorporate modern robotics in our facilities. We use Hortimax to control lights, CO2, irrigation, cooling, heating, humidity, temperature, and even labor management.</p>
<p>Some facility designs also feature automated moving benches. All our inputs into the system are automated to reduce labor needs. We use drip irrigation, so each plant gets the same amount of water every time.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting:</strong> We are utilizing <a href="https://fluence.science/">Fluence Bioengineering</a> LED lighting technology for all our projects. We use their RAZR series for propagation, their SPYDRx series for veg, and their SPYDRxPLUS series for flowering. With the LED lights, we&rsquo;re using 40 percent less electricity compared to HID.</p>
<p><strong><em>What challenges have you faced?</em></strong><em><br /> </em>Since we are working with a biological process, we have faced the normal agricultural challenges like pests and disease, nutritional issues, and even labor. However, by incorporating Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs), we can find issues early and mitigate them quickly to reduce any economic loss.<br /> It&rsquo;s also proving difficult to find suppliers and manufacturers from commercial agriculture that are willing to participate in the emerging cannabis industry, especially those from Europe that specialize in controlled environment agriculture.</p>
<p><strong><em>What has been your biggest success?</em></strong><em><br /> </em>Successful integration of modern technology into cannabis production. After all, a plant is a plant, and 90 percent of what it takes to optimize tomato production is the same for cannabis. And a good grower can easily adapt to the final 10 percent that is species-specific.</p>
<p><strong><em>What advice do you have for future growers?</em></strong><em><br /> </em>Rely on the experience and know-how of commercial agriculture/horticulture growers when designing your grow operation. It will be the way of the future for growing crops. Always look for better ways of doing things.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>BY chef Kendall Smith, Unifern LLC</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p>In addition to being the production manager at local cannabis cultivation and production company Unifern LLC, chef Kendall Smith is also working on a new project called The Cure Collectors. “Essentially, we utilize a proprietary refining process on cannabis extractions which allows us to produce a 98 percent pure THC fraction,” explains Smith of The Cure Collectors. “This 98 percent fraction is the foundation of all of our edibles, topical and vaping products and allows us to produce products that are superior in quality to everything currently available in the marketplace.” </p>
<p>Smith sums up his latest venture in practical terms, “imagine biting into an edible and not being able to taste any trace of cannabis or enjoying a vape pen that has a delicious fruity taste, but is also above 93 percent THC.”  </p>

<h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
3 cups chicken stock
2 teaspoons turmeric
3 Tablespoons ras el hanout spice
2 teaspoons dried coriander
2 Tablespoons garlic powder
4 star anise pods
2 teaspoons sweet paprika
2 Tablespoons onion powder
1 teaspoon cayenne powder 
1/4 cup canned diced pineapple, drained and reserved
1 cup dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 Tablespoons honey
3 Tablespoons lemon juice
1 can (6 oz.) tomato paste
3 Tablespoons canna-infused butter or oil
2 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs
Your bread of choice (I recommend thick-cut Hawaiian sweet bread)


<h3>Directions:</h3>
<p>In a medium pot, combine chicken stock with all of the dry spice ingredients and drained, diced pineapple. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat, then strain and return the strained liquid back to the pot over medium heat.</p>
<p>Stir in dark brown sugar, salt, honey, lemon juice and tomato paste, blending completely. Bring mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for another 10 minutes. Then stir in 3 Tablespoons of canna-butter or infused oil till completely blended.</p>
<p>Place the chicken thighs in a slow cooker and pour sauce over till completely covered. Cook on lowest setting for 3-5 hours or till fall-apart tender. With two forks or a pair of cooking tongs, shred the chicken completely right in the sauce.</p>
<p>For some nice texture, toast two slices of Hawaiian sweet bread (or any bread of choice) and load it up with your delicious pulled chicken. You can add whatever else you like to this tasty sandwich -- coleslaw, cheese, or pickles are all great additions. Get creative and enjoy!&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Please remember when cooking with medicinal cannabis you are cooking with a medicine and the medicine amount and portions of the food ingested should always be taken into consideration. Always start out with small portions or doses and wait 30 minutes to an hour before eating any additional portions of food that has been medicated.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>COLORADO</h2>
In May, Governor John Hickenlooper signed a bill into law to help fight the opioid epidemic in Colorado. The law creates a center for prevention, research and treatment to tackle the opioid and prescription drug abuse problem. The center will be funded with $1 million from the marijuana tax cash fund and will be headquartered at the University of Colorado Anschutz medical campus. 
Also in Colorado cannabis news, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is now a qualifying condition for doctor-recommended medical marijuana. In June, Gov. John Hickenlooper signed Senate Bill 17 into law, which opens the doors for Colorado residents to receive a doctor’s approval to use medical marijuana in the treatment of PTSD symptoms. It’s the first new qualifying condition added under the state’s medical marijuana law since it was implemented in 2001.

<h2>NEVADA</h2>
Nevada dispensaries are scheduled to begin selling recreational legal marijuana on July 1 with the Nevada Tax Commission’s approval of an early-start program on May 8.  The regulations lay out rules for issuing and revoking licenses to companies that are already up and running in the medical marijuana industry. While voters approved a ballot measure last year requiring the state to get sales going by Jan. 1, 2018, the “early start” program would allow businesses to launch six months early. State officials are also counting on tax revenue from early marijuana sales to help them balance the budget. Governor Brian Sandoval’s budget proposal calls for an additional tax on recreational marijuana sales that would yield an estimated $70 million to support public education.

<h2>UTAH</h2>
Utah lawmakers have elected not to join more than half of all U.S. states by passing a broad medical marijuana law. Instead, lawmakers gave state colleges and other institutions a green light to study the medical impacts of the drug with the hope of having comprehensive data by next year. However, the studies would likely take years, requiring scientists to navigate layers of bureaucracy that can delay and even discourage research. The slowdown to study cannabis is due to marijuana being considered a Schedule I drug by the federal government, meaning it's listed along with heroin and peyote among the most dangerous drugs.

<h2>VERMONT</h2>
In early June, Vermont Governor Phil Scott signed S. 16, a bill that will significantly improve patients’ access to Vermont’s medical marijuana program. The bill adds post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Parkinson’s disease, and Crohn’s disease to the list of qualifying conditions. It also authorizes an additional dispensary (bringing the statewide total to five), and allows existing dispensaries to open one additional location each. When the patient registry reaches 7,000, an additional dispensary will be authorized.

<h2>FLORIDA</h2>
On June 9 in a special session of the Florida Legislature, the Florida House and Senate passed a long-awaited medical marijuana implementation bill. The bill now heads to Gov. Rick Scott’s desk, who said he “absolutely intends to sign it.” The legislation allows patients who suffer chronic pain related to 10 qualifying conditions to receive either low-THC cannabis or full-strength medical marijuana. Both chambers reached an agreement that there would be a statewide cap of 25 dispensaries per medical marijuana treatment center until the statewide registry reaches 100,000 patients. At that point, the bill calls for adding four more dispensaries. Legislators also agreed the medicine will not be taxed.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Richard S. Gubbe</h4>

<p>Amsterdam is the party city that works within a tolerant government framework, kinda. Sound familiar?</p>
<p>Those who think less government intervention is better need to look at this business/tourism model for the good it brings. But the lack of legal clarity makes it a perilous venture for business owners whose fate could alter course with the winds of political change. Ring a bell?&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the new age of cannabis, routinely Nevada, or more accurately Las Vegas, is often compared to Amsterdam. The parallels between the two cities are as stark as the differences.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>It isn&rsquo;t legal there either?</h3>
<p>Individual jurisdictions in the Netherlands oversee the sale and consumption of &ldquo;soft&rdquo; drugs. No hard drags are allowed in the country and the airport screening, arrest and conviction statistics bear that out. But, to maintain its status in the European Union (EU), the country takes the official stance that all drugs are illegal. But soft drugs are allowed, tolerated and tested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where the marijuana actually comes from is everywhere and anywhere. Only five plants are allowed for any one individual by regulation, yet coffeeshops sell far more pot every day than five plants here and there. If everyone in <br /> the city had five plants and sold it to them, it still wouldn&rsquo;t be enough.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Advantage Nevada with its strict oversight of 88 licensed cultivation outlets that are required to lab test. Where the more than 200 coffeehouses in Amsterdam get marijuana and hashish to sell remains a question best left unasked. The hash is usually black and most comes hand-rolled from India and Nepal. The pot comes in through loose borders, or is sometimes grown in shipping containers.</p>
<h3>Mokum Smokum</h3>
<p>Mokum, a popular nickname for Amsterdam derived from the Hebrew &lsquo;makom,&rsquo; which means &lsquo;place,&rsquo; is a city that consumes large amounts of cannabis as part of daily life. The climate is about tolerance in all Dutch cities that can opt in or out. EU countries must follow the script that all drugs are bad, soft or hardcore, but those of a powdery substance are especially evil. Soft drugs are not culturally in the same class as an opioid in America. Amsterdam does not adhere to the soft drug part of the treaty and no one seems to care. Why? Because it is regulated with treatment options and the populous generally deems it harmless.</p>
<p>Regulation in Amsterdam also includes onsite testing of products. If the THC percentage is on the menu at 27.5 percent, it had better test at that or else the dispensary is closed and a full inventory test takes place. Whereas in Nevada, 11 independent laboratories are licensed to test the state&rsquo;s homegrown cannabis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dutch policy of keeping anti-drug laws on the books while limiting enforcement of certain offenses is carefully designed to reduce harm while still complying with international drug control treaties. This is necessary in order to avoid criticism from the International Narcotics Board, which historically has called all illicit drugs poison. In their annual report, the board has criticized many governments, including Canada, for permitting the medicinal use of cannabis.</p>

<h3>No crime dere?</h3>
<p>Plenty to do in Amsterdam if you&rsquo;re high on vices. Legalized prostitution, gambling in small and large casinos, alcohol in Dutch bars and marijuana in clubs out in the open and tucked away in alleys. And yet crime is not a major problem; the country limits gun ownership and there are harsh penalties for breaking rules that involve powdery substances.</p>
<p>The only danger of dying in Amsterdam is getting killed by a bike or drinking too much. Or drinking too much and then getting hit by a bike. No murders, robberies or violence in the street. Nary a cab stickup. The largest criminal activity in Amsterdam comes from pickpockets. A robber needs an exit strategy and in Amsterdam there is none (see any map).</p>
<p>Government oversight includes a separation of all vices. Alcohol is served in bars and restaurants, prostitution is literally housed in the famed Red Light District, gambling is allowed only at casinos, and marijuana and hashish are served only in marijuana &ldquo;coffee&rdquo; houses. Throw in some sex shops and traditional and nontraditional massage parlors and the place is an adult playground accepted by the local populous. Some people walk down the street and smoke, but most of that is done discreetly in alleyways.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The larger coffeehouses in Amsterdam have one or two guards at the door. The rest of the workers are waitresses, cooks and budtenders. Budtenders are often Americans escaping the bonds of regulation. Most budtenders speak a modicum of English. The coffeehouses are as safe as it gets. There may be cultural differences as to whom the house caters to, and segregation in large clubs often occurs with Arabic cultures.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>They put what in their weed?</h3>
<p>When you enter many of the coffeehouses, there is a large individual to make sure you aren&rsquo;t loaded or dangerous. No backpacks are allowed in most houses, no drunks, and no nefarious types as deemed by the bouncer. Bars are run by old Dutch families and are for rowdy tourists and coffeehouses are for pacifists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is allowed and what should be banned is tobacco. Europeans still consider tobacco non-offensive. Although sequestered somewhat, dispensaries do the unspeakable and mix tobacco and premium flower to make it go further. Yuk. Ask for pure joints when ordering prerolls because the taste is unmistakable. Smoking tobacco should not be allowed in any coffeehouse, and some oblige. Why ruin or negate someone&rsquo;s high with tobacco? Hash is so plentiful that most locals mix it instead of tobacco. Nevada will do better.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>You can get anything you want at Alice&rsquo;s</h3>
<p>No impaired driving is found; the streets are too narrow in the center of town to navigate. Why bother? Amsterdam has the greatest linked transportation system in the world. With hookups from the airport to anywhere in the region, there is an excelled regional train system and local train/trams that whisk people from place to place. The busses connect to everywhere. The downtown train station is not only a hub for getting place to place with buses, cabs and trams, it is located mere blocks from hotels, shopping, massage parlors, restaurants and countless small and brand-name businesses. The only downside is the maddening and dangerous number of bicycles so those in altered states need to pay close attention.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What it means for medical patients</h3>
<p>Dispensaries here don&rsquo;t allow for samples as Amsterdam does. Most coffeehouses allow for trying something before buying a large amount. Also, it gives patients the option of smoking or vaping outside the home, away from the nieces and nephews.</p>
<p>Coffeehouses often have bong rentals and hookahs sitting on tables. Bong rental fees are often given back when the bong is returned.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is lacking in coffeehouses are decent edibles. With all the medical marijuana establishments (MMEs) cooking up a storm in Nevada, there should be much better edibles on Vegas menus.</p>
<h3>Do you know where your parents are?</h3>
<p>Daily clubgoers are typically young, as in 18 to 25. Entry into coffeeshops and the sale of cannabis in Amsterdam is permissible to anyone over the age of 18. Most locals found there are college educated and speak at least two to three languages. They are most often employed and many still live at home where two-parent households are the norm. When asked if their parents indulge, the answer is usually yes. When asked where mom and dad are now? &ldquo;Sitting in front of the television getting high.&rdquo; And what are they watching? American sitcoms and dramas that are two to three years old.</p>

<h3>Consumption Conundrum</h3>
<p>While Amsterdam&rsquo;s menu boards are typical of what Nevada offers, consumption will be a conundrum for tourists coming here. Forty-two million visitors are expected to make their way to Las Vegas this year compared to five million tourists who visited Amsterdam&rsquo;s Red Light District and its many cannabis coffeeshops in 2016. Amsterdam boasts a population of more than 851,000 and Las Vegas is estimated at 623,747.</p>
<p>Nevada has no current plan in place for its visitors to recreate, while the Bulldog clubs, a chain of tourist traps, are popular and located in and around bars and even in Amsterdam&rsquo;s Red Light District. Bulldog differs from a general house with coffee as its commercial appeal. There is one example of an off-alley club, Prix d&rsquo;Ami, Johnny Depp&rsquo;s purported hangout, which features three floors that boast a comfy movie room on the top floor, a pool room, board games and a restaurant setting on the second floor and a dispensary and coffeeshop on the first floor.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Vegas clubs should look like</h3>
<p>Nevada has no international drug treaty pressure, only to survive the federal banking regulations. The road to a more complete program needs to include opioid addiction programs.</p>
<p>No dispensaries within 200 meters of a school, no tobacco, and sample rooms for medical patients need to be included. No need to go crazy, 60 dispensary licenses currently cover a good test run throughout the state. Because of the autonomy of the state and further autonomy of the Clark County Commission, everything can be stamped temporary or experimental.The legal age to partake is 21, not 18 as in Amsterdam. Ride programs also should be strongly considered.</p>
<p>What Amsterdam has shown is the ability to work around the law while maintaining a safe environment for tourists. Nevada can do even better by growing and selling its own cannabis, placing consumption clubs in safe areas, and making sure the medicine part of the law stays intact.</p>
<p>The best of all worlds awaits in the Newest Amsterdam. &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h4>By Amanda Connor, Connor & Connor  </h4>
<p>Many Nevadans celebrated last November when Question 2 passed and retail (in Nevada law it is &ldquo;retail marijuana&rdquo; not &ldquo;recreational marijuana&rdquo;) use of marijuana became legal as of January 1, 2017. The Department of Taxation has been diligently working to get the facilities licensed and the goal is to have operational retail marijuana stores by July 1, 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Numerous questions have surfaced with this major change in state law and Nevadans are eager to bring a successful new industry to the Silver State. Here&rsquo;s what <br /> you need to know about retail marijuana in Nevada.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Adults over the age of 21 can:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Purchase up to 1 oz. of cannabis flower buds or 1/8 oz. of concentrated cannabis.</li>
<li>Use legally acquired cannabis in private locations.</li>
<li>Buy from licensed retail marijuana stores (once they become operational).</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Initially only medical marijuana licensed facilities will be dual licensed as retail marijuana stores.</li>
<li>Until the retail marijuana licenses are issued by the Department of Taxation, there is no legal place to purchase retail marijuana in Nevada.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Possess retail marijuana related paraphernalia.</li>
<li>Still be held to workplace drug policy and other applicable drug policies.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Adults over the age of 21 cannot:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Use cannabis flower or concentrated cannabis in public.</li>
<li>Transport marijuana across state lines.</li>
<li>Sell retail marijuana without a valid retail marijuana license from the Department of Taxation.</li>
<li>Drive under the influence.</li>
<li>Grow retail marijuana at home if located within 25 miles of a retail marijuana store.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, pursuant to Senate Bill 487 which was passed and signed into law by Governor Sandoval in June, Nevada will assess a 10 percent excise tax at the point of sale of retail marijuana. The 10 percent excise tax on retail marijuana is estimated to raise about $70 million which is earmarked for education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Medical marijuana patient cardholders who purchase medical marijuana will not be assessed this 10 percent tax. While Question 2 legalized the retail use of marijuana, Nevada will continue to maintain and work to improve its medical marijuana program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to numerous medical benefits and a greater understanding of the not so detrimental effects of marijuana, the majority of adults in Nevada feel that the retail use of marijuana should be permitted &ndash; as evidenced by the voters when they passed Question 2 by 54 percent in November.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was high time for a change in policy and government officials and the industry have been diligently working to bring about an effective and safe retail marijuana program. The future for the marijuana industry in Nevada looks bright. &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Nevada’s alcohol wholesalers rain  on pot’s coming  out party</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seventeen years after cannabis first became legal for medical use in Nevada, dispensaries were beginning celebratory preparations for the July 1st opening of the recreational marijuana market. Although not without a last-minute party foul in the form of a court case brought by the Independent Alcohol Distributors of Nevada (IADON) against the Nevada Department of Taxation.</p>
<p>After filing a temporary restraining order against the Nevada Department of Taxation prohibiting it from enforcing an application deadline for marijuana distribution licenses, IADON made their case in front of Carson City Judge James Wilson on June 19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crux of the case began with IADON filing a complaint on May 30th, arguing that the November voter-approved ballot measure, known as Question #2, which legalizes cannabis in Nevada, gives liquor wholesalers exclusive rights to marijuana distribution licenses for the first 18 months of sales in the state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although alcohol wholesalers were to have exclusive distribution rights, in mid-March the Department of Taxation opened the licensing application process to the marijuana industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opening that distributor license up to everyone gives them a monopoly, and I don&rsquo;t believe the voters voted in a monopoly. It would allow them to become vertically integrated and handle everything from start to finish and none of us believe that&rsquo;s what the people voted in when they said regulate marijuana like alcohol,&rdquo; said Peggy Arquilla, IADON member and president of West Coast Wine &amp; Spirits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department of Taxation opened licensing to the marijuana industry because of concerns that there wouldn&rsquo;t be enough alcohol wholesalers to service the industry. Arquilla disputes that. &ldquo;In reality one or two liquor distributors have more capacity to service 100 or 200 customers and the fact that there were 30 who expressed interest, we can all just kinda do the math and I think that answers that question.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the May 15-31 application process, 93 applications were turned in for marijuana distribution licenses -- five were from liquor wholesalers and 88 were from existing medical marijuana establishments, according to State of Nevada Tax Department spokesperson Stephanie Klapstein.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for how many distributors are necessary for the program, there is no way to forecast numbers because Nevada&rsquo;s medical marijuana program does not require distributors. Most medical marijuana establishments are handling their own transportation needs shuttling marijuana between cultivations, production facilities, and dispensaries or they are using Blackbird Logistics Corporation, which is currently transporting medical marijuana on behalf of approximately 60 facilities in the state. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s of no consequence now. Five will have to do because just 10 days before the start date of recreational marijuana sales, Judge Wilson handed down his ruling in favor of alcohol wholesalers, granting liquor license holders exclusive distribution rights for the initial 18 months of the state&rsquo;s new marijuana industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although some thought pot&rsquo;s coming out party was over before it even started, Blackbird will continue serving the medical market and will also be able to serve the recreational market. They have an alcohol wholesalers license and were one of the five companies who applied for a recreational distribution license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Liquor wholesalers say they are also ready. &ldquo;We have everything in place, our operation is extremely simple,&rdquo; said Bevi Beverages&rsquo; Massimo D&rsquo;Arrigo of the July 1st start date.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone will know soon enough. &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Justin Alexander</h4>

<p>As Nevada&rsquo;s burgeoning cannabis marketplace continues to take shape and find its way, many cultivations and production houses are finding their niche -- excelling at producing and growing specific products. Some brands are even becoming well-known among cannasseurs for signature strains or products that set them apart from their cannabis brethren due to a distinct characteristic, unique feature or singular flavor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this month&rsquo;s review, <em>elevate</em> gathered signature strains and products from across the industry and ended up with a mix of flower, edibles, and vapes that will appeal to both patients and recreational users. The benefit of signature products is there is such a wide variety, you will undoubtedly find a gem. Or you may even come across a product you have been hoping someone would make as many of these products were created with a specific purpose or goal in mind. Whether carefully developed through a proprietary algorithm or discovered because of a happy accident, there is something for everyone in this review. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Remedy&rsquo;s Deadhead OG</h3>
<p>A signature strain because of its high yield and easy growth potential, Remedy&rsquo;s Deadhead OG is the love child of SFV OG Kush and Ultimate 91 Chemdawg. &ldquo;The medicine this flower provides is unmatched. The terpenes on this are crazy,&rdquo; says Remedy&rsquo;s Cultivation Manager Chris Welch. That outcome was unexpected, but one the team at Remedy was pleasantly surprised to find. &ldquo;We did expect good test results, be we were very happy to see the wide variety of terps, and, of course, the high THC doesn&rsquo;t hurt either. Also, there&rsquo;s the shape and quality of the product, how well it grew, and to even see characteristics from each of the parent plants,&rdquo; explains Welch of the strain which tests at 29.87 percent THC. One of the most distinguishing characteristics of Deadhead OG is the interesting dreams it produces along with euphoria in the conscious state. In addition to great sleep, it gives the overall body unparalleled relaxation and a tuned-in cerebral effect that comes with an indica-heavy hybrid. On both the nose and palate, this is a hearty, pungent strain.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Naked City OG Rosin Rocket from Oasis</h3>
<p>One of Oasis Medical&rsquo;s best-selling products, the Naked City OG Rosin Rocket, is a solventless hash-infused pre-roll. &ldquo;[Oasis created it to] appease indica lovers and people looking for a powerful OG kush hybrid,&rdquo; says Oasis&rsquo; head of cultivation Don Decatur, who notes, &ldquo;the function of these have been improved over previous Rosin Rocket designs.&rdquo; Infused joints provide an extra strong kick with 24.9 THC for those looking for maximum pain relief and relaxation. While they do burn harsh, they burn slow. Expect a heavy head high and a nice smooth melting into the couch vibe.</p>
<h3>Virtue&rsquo;s Diamond Dust</h3>
<p>&ldquo;The goal of this particular strain was to create a flower with OG Kush effects even though the lineage is not OG. Diamond Dust is a stop on the way to that goal,&rdquo; explains David Holmes, owner of Clade9 and head cultivator at Virtue Las Vegas, of the indica-dominant hybrid that is a product of his proprietary algorithm called the &ldquo;Holmes Matrix.&rdquo; In creating this signature strain, he was pleasantly surprised with the yield and its structure, color and trichome density&mdash;rocky buds in bright, beautiful colors with deep green, purple and orange hairs, all under a blanket of white crystals that offer the appearance of a web of glistening diamonds, hence the name. When sampling the flower, the first thing to take notice of is the distinct pine aroma as well as the smooth sweet and sour taste of Diamond Dust that is finely laced with hints of citrus. Mouthwatering and strong, the high is long-lasting with THC that ranges from the mid- to high 20s and will carry you through many hours in the evening with deep relaxation and muscle release, leading to euphoria and self-reflection.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>KYND CBD Chocolate Bar</h3>
<p>KYND Cannabis Company has made a name for itself with premium flower, edibles and concentrates that are approachable, yet effective for patients who are new to medicinal cannabis. One of KYND&rsquo;s most popular products is their 300-mg CBD Chocolate Bar, offered in the same dark chocolate with sea salt and creamy milk chocolate versions as their THC bars. &ldquo;These chocolate bars were our first foray into infused edibles, and they really are incredible,&rdquo; says owner and CEO Mark Pitchford. &ldquo;Our goal was a high-end infused edible that delivered on taste and consistency. We work with an amazing local chocolatier, and the combination of whole, fresh ingredients and our premium cannabis oils has resulted in something really special. When you start with gourmet chocolate, how can you go wrong?&rdquo; Not having to smoke to enjoy the healing benefits of CBD is one of the bonuses of an edible that makes a sweet marriage of cannabis oil and chocolate. With each square of chocolate, you fall deeper into a relaxed state that takes the edge off with the sensation of a relaxed and happy high without THC or its side effects of paranoia and anxiousness.</p>
<h3>Medizin&rsquo;s Million Dollar Baby</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, Million Dollar Baby, also known as M$B, is Medizin&rsquo;s signature heavy indica strain. Bred and selected by Calco Genetics, Million Dollar Baby is &ldquo;possibly one of the most desired varieties in the city,&rdquo; reveals Vice President and Lead Horticulturalist of Medizin Chris Wren. &ldquo;Upon release, we experience a large rush, and it typically sells out very quickly. Case in point, we launched this new harvest last week and are down to the last pound today.&rdquo; Elevated myrcene levels give this flower its powerful aroma and taste, which has notes of delicious and creamy cake frosting&mdash;a completely unique flavor in the world of cannabis strains. With just one hit, the effects of Million Dollar Baby at 22 to 26 percent THC are like icing on the cake overtaking even the most experienced smokers and creating blissfully sweet couch lock.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Blue Alien from Green &amp; Gold Supply Co.&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Blue Alien is a result of breeding Blue Power and Alien OG&mdash;both requiring extremely cool conditions to grow, according to Mitch Britten, owner of Green &amp; Gold Supply Co. The primary goal was &ldquo;a strong, resinous indica that packs a punch and is a very reliable yielder,&rdquo; Britten says, noting that it is strong in both terpene levels and THC at 21.89 percent. Unique to this varietal, Britten says that the whole plant turns entirely black just before harvest. While flavor and potency are the first things that hit right after a deep draw, a sweet berry taste runs through the lungs and into the head, sending you into a dreamy euphoria that will push even the most stressed people into a good night&rsquo;s sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>W Vapes&rsquo; Holy Grail cartridge&nbsp;</h3>
<p>While Holy Grail is a fairly new strain for W Vapes, the company is well-established in the cartridge world. &ldquo;We provide multiple strains by season with an artisan-style process to give the highest-quality concentrates and vaping experience on the market,&rdquo; says W Vapes co-founder Jeff Nagel. Testing in at 79 percent THC, Holy Grail boasts a full-spectrum native terpene profile with a true OG Kush gas flavor and effect. &ldquo;Our first priority is to ensure the health and safety of our consumers by providing an oil that is free of pesticides, fungicides, plant growth regulators&mdash;or PGRs&mdash;and residual solvents,&rdquo; explains Nagel, who continues, &ldquo;second, we like our products to represent the strain the oil was extracted from.&rdquo; Both novice and experienced smokers will fall in love with this super strain which produces an incredibly mellow and pleasurable high. Pain and nausea float away during a slow smoking session of this vape.</p>
<h3>Cannabiotix Casino Kush</h3>
<p>A cross between Whitewalker OG and Blue Flame, Cannabiotix Casino Kush is an indica-leaning hybrid that wipes away depression and pain. As a signature strain of Cannabiotix, it pumps creativity and happiness into your mental state with every draw. This is a very strong strain at 29 percent THC and .035 percent CBD. Best for moderate to advanced smokers, it will put you out of this world in no time at all and send you into a blissful state. Spicy and robust on the nose, the name is an especially cool recognition point for Las Vegans.</p>
<h3>Dabaratus by O.pen Vape</h3>
<p>Making the dabbing process easier with potent, terpene-rich distillate oil built into a convenient applicator, the Dabaratus is a cutting-edge device that is both clever and stylish. &ldquo;The Star Killer distillate is a perfect pairing to the hardware seeing as it&rsquo;s such a high potency with long-lasting effects, you wouldn&rsquo;t want to consume too much at a time,&rdquo; explains Jonathon Cline, a representative of Bakked, the manufacturer of Dabaratus. &ldquo;This strain is unique in that it has a relatively high CBG content (2.638 percent), which is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid that decreases inflammation, decreases ocular pressure, and acts as an antidepressant making it great for pain relief, IBS, glaucoma and inducing a general sense of well-being.&rdquo; The Dabaratus filled with CO2 Bakked Distillate oil tests at 7.720 percent D9-THC and is for anyone from novice to cannasseur. A full gram will last a long time and this product is measurable so there is much less waste. &ldquo;You can use it as an edible, sublingually, to dab with directly on a nail, refill your handheld vaporizer, or to liven up your joints, blunts, and bowls,&rdquo; suggests Cline. Grab the Dabaratus when micro-dosing or mega-dosing after a long day for Star Killer&rsquo;s intense high with a cerebral creep. This strain makes the day brighter and the stress melt away.</p>
<h3>Redwood Cultivation&rsquo;s Sugar Cookies</h3>
<p>A name as intriguing as Sugar Cookies sets a high bar for a strain of weed, and word has gotten out that it lives up to its reputation. &ldquo;All the hype out there is about the cookie strain, and this is our best yet,&rdquo; offers lead cultivator Jon Annalora of Redwood Cultivation&rsquo;s signature strain Sugar Cookies which tests at 25 percent THC. &ldquo;We always continue pheno-hunting and looking for the next best one.&rdquo; Along with dense, colorful flowers, Sugar Cookies is extra frosty in appearance just as you think it would be based on its name. This product is aimed at the &ldquo;cannasseur&rdquo; who is searching for the best medicine on the market. Tasty is its top attribute with a sweet cookie dough flavor and terps that match its calm, relaxing effects. Expect a soothing high with sleep benefits and an increased appetite that will probably make you reach for real sugar cookies.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Evergreen Organix Fruity Cereal Treats</h3>
<p>If you prefer to consume your medicine as a delicious, fun edible, then consider Evergreen Organix&rsquo;s fruity cereal sativa treat. &ldquo;While we generally consider our cookie and brownie line to be our signature products, our cereal bars have proved to be very popular,&rdquo; says Jillian Nelson, operations manager, Evergreen Organix. Each treat is made by combining marshmallow and cereal into a puff of goodness. Full of true-to-treat flavor, the sweet fruit taste is pleasing and not overpowering. Ideal for those who are smoke-free and want a snack that packs medicinal qualities.</p>
<h3>The+Source&rsquo;s Pennywise distillate&nbsp;</h3>
<p>An indica-dominant hybrid, Pennywise distillate is 99 percent cannabinoids, which means it provides maximum medicinal relief for a variety of ailments. &ldquo;The 99 percent total cannabinoids is a benchmark we have been driving for and it&rsquo;s nice to achieve that potency level with a THC/CBD strain distillate,&rdquo; says Eric V. Vega, The+Source&rsquo;s director of operations. &ldquo;[We wanted to achieve] the highest potency possible so less product will produce the required effect.&rdquo; The Pennywise strain itself is most commonly used to treat arthritis, PTSD, epilepsy, neurological disorders, and cancer related symptoms. It contains a 1:1 ratio of CBD and THC (43.5 percent THC; 49.3 percent CBD) and a luminous appearance, so the psychoactive effects are milder and more relaxing. Expect a euphoric and invigorating buzz with bursts of sharp mental clarity.</p>
<h3>Rove OG Vape Cartridge</h3>
<p>They say you never forget your first one and in the case of Rove, their OG Vape cartridge is a true original as it was their very first product. It was made with the goal of capturing those who love to smoke THC-potent flower at a ratio of 72.94 percent THC/0.16 percent CBD. &ldquo;OG was the first strain Rove developed and is generally our most potent. OG flower has a very distinctive taste and aroma and our oil captures those flavors in such a precise way, it is always a big hit with cannabis traditionalist flower aficionados,&rdquo; says Chris Ellenberger, director of operations for Rove Nevada. Priding themselves on potency, the consistency of the Rove oil is very thick. &ldquo;Hitting a Rove cartridge is a bit like taking a mini wax dab,&rdquo; Ellenberger says. &ldquo;Many cannabis vape oils are diluted with fillers or thinners, but Rove&rsquo;s thick oil is a sign of a commitment to potency.&rdquo; This product is pure, its OG roots with a super stoney high will stop insomnia dead in its tracks. Feel your body lift away and be transported upon a cloud, taking away pain and increasing the need for one last snack before bed.</p>
<h3>Nevada Medical Marijuana&rsquo;s Kabunky Klear Vaporizer Cartridge Strawnanna</h3>
<p>Convenience is a key factor of Kabunky Klear&rsquo;s vaporizer cartridge as you just screw it on and go when it&rsquo;s time for a dose of medicine. Not only is the chamber extra-large with 500mg of concentrate and easily monitored, but expect maximum fruit flavor in the notes with a delicious mix of strawberry and banana. Nevada MMJ&rsquo;s Chris DeGraff says this didn&rsquo;t happen by accident. &ldquo;What I was really trying to go with was a profile that didn't just taste like somebody threw a bunch of terps in a cartridge,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I was going with individual flavors that would taste good to the patient. Something that doesn't taste like every other cartridge on the market right now.&rdquo; Strawnanna offers a nice smooth taste that lingers on the back of your tongue after the hit and is versatile for all types of smokers. &ldquo;If you're a connoisseur in the industry and you're looking for a really, really, really nice top shelf concentrate in a very nice disposable cartridge, it's phenomenal for that,&rdquo; DeGraff says of the 80 percent THC/10.8 CBD vape cartridge. &ldquo;Or if you're a first-time user and you're looking for something that's not gonna completely knock you [out] after one hit in terms of the high, it is uplifting and body-centric without putting you on the couch.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h4>by Riana Durrett, Esq., Executive Director of Nevada Dispensary Association</h4>
<p>As the dust from the Nevada legislative session settles, it&rsquo;s time to take a look at the changes expected to take place in Nevada&rsquo;s marijuana industry. During this past legislative session, the Nevada Legislature focused primarily on issues related to medical marijuana as decisions about &ldquo;retail,&rdquo; or recreational marijuana, will be made by the Department of Taxation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One major focus of the legislative session was to improve and preserve the medical marijuana program. Ahead of the session, Nevada Dispensary Association (NDA) members expressed concern that the medical program could be vulnerable, given the difficulties patients experienced in obtaining patient cards in the past as well as other hurdles faced by the program. With this vulnerability in mind, the NDA sought to improve access for patients, in addition to making other changes meant to ensure the continued sustainability of the program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NDA was fortunate to find a dedicated ally in Assemblyman Nelson Araujo, who sponsored Assembly Bill 422 and Assembly Bill 463 specifically to make changes to the medical marijuana program and ensure its continued viability. When I originally appealed to Assemblyman Araujo in hopes that he might sponsor bills supporting the medical marijuana program in Nevada, I was unaware of how much time and effort the request would demand of him. Fortunately, the Assemblyman was knowledgeable about the program and worked tirelessly to pass bills that would improve patient access and allow for streamlined business operations and regulatory functions. Assemblyman Araujo worked closely with the Godfather of Nevada&rsquo;s marijuana industry, Senator Richard &ldquo;Tick&rdquo; Segerblom, to ensure that both the Assembly and Senate could pass a bill that would allow the program to continue to accommodate the needs of patients and the businesses that are essential to the continued success of <br /> the program.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The highlights of these efforts, which become effective July 1, include: &nbsp;</h4>

<p><strong>Patient Access:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allows patients to access medical marijuana the same day they see a doctor, similar to any prescription medication, by allowing patients to furnish their application for a patient card to a dispensary&nbsp;</li>
<li>Expands who can issue recommendations for medical use of marijuana</li>
<li>Allows patient cards to be valid for up to two years&nbsp;</li>
<li>Reduces the cost of a patient card</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Regulatory Framework:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changes wholesale tax structure to<br /> allow for &ldquo;single stream&rdquo; of medical and retail products (*This was originally in AssemblymanAraujo&rsquo;s AB463, but was moved to, and passed in, Senate Bill 487)</li>
<li>Allows any person over 21 to enter a medical marijuana dispensary&nbsp;</li>
<li>Caps fees and taxes imposed by local governments</li>
<li>Transfers the medical marijuanaprogram, except the portion&nbsp;relating to patient cards, to the&nbsp;Department of Taxation</li>
<li>Clarifies and extends reciprocity to patients from qualifying states</li>
<li>Allows individuals to apply to Taxation to work for, or provide services to, a medical marijuana establishment</li>
<li>Changes requirements for renewing or transferring ownership</li>
</ul>

<h4>Many other bills relating to marijuana were introduced with varying results. The highlights include:&nbsp;</h4>

<p><strong>Passed:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Additional 10 percent excise tax on retail sales</li>
<li>Restrictions on packaging, labeling, and advertising of edible marijuana</li>
<li>Allowing hemp growers to sell directly to medical marijuana establishments</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Failed:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Consumption lounges (this may still be attainable at a local level)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Adding opiate addiction as a qualifying condition for a marijuana patient card&nbsp;</li>
<li>Addressing the concealed carry issue</li>
<li>Allowing organized labor to enter into agreements with medical marijuana establishments tom&nbsp;participate in apprenticeship programs</li>
<li>Expansion of the ability to grow at home</li>
</ul>

<p>Of the 23 bills introduced relating to marijuana--ranging from concealed carry rights to registering to work in the industry--only approximately one-third of those bills passed and, of that third, only a handful were signed into law by Governor Sandoval.&nbsp; While session was ongoing, NDA, along with other industry stakeholders, participated in the hearings, public workshops, and adoption of the temporary regulations (regulating retail marijuana) and in the Governor&rsquo;s Task Force, which will help shape <br /> permanent regulations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NDA is grateful that Nevada lawmakers, regulators and industry stakeholders pulled together to support Nevada&rsquo;s medical marijuana program this session, which has been widely commended as a national model in several areas, including inventory control and testing standards.&nbsp; In addition, the Department of Taxation has accomplished the seemingly impossible task of implementing a new government program (retail sales) in only approximately six months and we look forward to implementation of their well-developed, comprehensive regulations on July 1. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&ldquo;The light didn&rsquo;t come on for me until about a year or a-year-in-a-half ago,&rdquo; Med&middot;a&middot;mints co-founder Gary Garbel admits of discovering cannabis&rsquo; medicinal properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the cannabis entrepreneur first brought Med&middot;a&middot;mints to the Colorado marketplace in 2011, it wasn&rsquo;t that long ago when he realized the healing effects of his product. &ldquo;In my mind it was about getting high and when I was high I knew that I felt good -- it freshened my mind, stimulated my imagination and creativity, and I really enjoyed skiing. I realized what it was doing for me but I didn&rsquo;t think of that in medical terms. By keeping ourselves healthy and avoiding being sick we are maintaining our health, which is a medical benefit,&rdquo; notes Gabrel of cannabis&rsquo; healing role.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gabrel initially entered the cannabis industry because &ldquo;I have entrepreneurism in my blood and have created a lot of different businesses and, having been successful at a couple, it has given me the freedom to work for myself so I have followed my heart and passion and beliefs. My entry into the cannabis business is a reflection of what I believe in and what I think is very important. I am really proud to be a part of the change that&rsquo;s going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A veteran of the restaurant business as well as having experience in product development, Gabrel was interested in getting in the cannabis space so he brainstormed with his wife and friends about the optimal delivery form that would equate to long-term success. &ldquo;People were doing things like ice cream and baked goods and I didn&rsquo;t want to have problems with refrigeration and shelf-life. I forget how we came up with the idea of mints but once we did, it seemed like a terrific way to go and it was a very fortuitous choice because this category has developed to be really solid and one that makes sense. Given our experience with pharmaceuticals and small controlled dose forms, it just makes sense with a potent medicine and drug as opposed to confections and candy,&rdquo; explains Gabrel of Med&middot;a&middot;mints, which is a sugar-free dose with 10 mg THC per mint that he describes as &ldquo;the healthiest product in a dispensary.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As edibles have become more popular, overdosing has been a problem because it&rsquo;s a new form of uptake for most people so there is a learning curve we have to go through both individually and as a society to understand dosing of this particular medicine in different forms. I thought it would be good to dose in small increments and that&rsquo;s perfect for mints and tablets,&rdquo; Gabrel continues, &ldquo;a mint, and ours specifically, is meant to be absorbed in the mouth and not chewed and swallowed. Absorption through the mucus membranes is faster, more consistent, and more potent than medicine that is swallowed. Those are great features of this particular edible product that are not true of other edibles. A problem that many people have with edibles is the slow onset of the medicine, people lose patience or they are not getting the relief they want fast enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gabrel developed Med&middot;a&middot;mints &ldquo;to be good for the core culture, but the emphasis is on people like ourselves, I am a senior citizen now, I just turned 65. I made the product for people like myself -- people who want to use cannabis and they want to do it conveniently, smart and responsibly. We think our target audience is smart consumers -- people who read labels and pay attention to ingredients and are interested in different ways of taking the medicine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A third generation Nevadan, State Senator Tick Segerblom was born and raised in Boulder City, Nevada. An employment attorney, Segerblom was first elected to the Nevada Assembly in 2006 and then to the Nevada State Senate in 2012, where he currently serves as Chair of the Senate Committee on Judiciary. A longtime marijuana advocate, Senator Segerblom has been instrumental in the legislative progress cannabis has made in the Silver State. 
Segerblom comes from a long line of government servants. His mother, Gene Segerblom (née Wines), served in the Nevada Assembly from 1992 through 2000 and was a member of the Boulder City Council. His grandmother, Hazel Wines (née Bell), served in the Nevada Assembly from 1934 - 1936 representing Humboldt County. Segerblom's great-grandfather was William "Johnny" Bell representing Humboldt County from 1906 to 1914 in the Nevada Senate.

It’s a historic moment -- how does it feel to see cannabis become recreationally legal in Nevada?</a></h4>

<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">
I will feel better when today is over, once the court hearing in Carson City is over. Assuming it goes well and the judge doesn’t stop it, it will be one of the most exciting days of my life. It’s hard to believe that it’s finally going to happen. I think it opens a whole new era for Nevada. When you look at how Las Vegas has embraced the Electric Daisy Carnival, it just seems to me we are really looking at millennials as our future and I think marijuana is part of the millennial culture.

<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I knew that it was doable but it wasn’t one of my goals. It didn’t become a real fixture until the 2012 election when Washington state and Colorado voted for recreational marijuana, at that point it just seemed like the time for Nevada was ripe. Everybody still said we would never be able to do it, but truthfully there was no opposition so we moved forward and everyone agreed we should do it.

</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I will be involved but I do think it’s time for me to move on to other things. The technical changes will probably be suggested by the governor. Other than having marijuana lounges or some type of restricted public use I think I have done about as much as I can do. I do think that that’s going to be the next issue: how do we embed marijuana into our tourism culture? It just seems so perfect for Nevada to me that I am not going to stop until we get it accomplished.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Not really, I think it’s something we are going to have to keep our eye on it. If there are not enough medical marijuana patients to keep it alive than we will have to change the tax structure so there’s more incentives for it because it definitely has medicinal qualities and we want to make sure people can afford it. But I think the key is to go forward and get health insurance to cover it, get workers comp to cover it – that will be the way to really make it affordable for people who really need it.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I am working on a legal opinion that says we don’t need state law to allow for the pot lounges.  That’s definitely the number one priority because we must have a place where people can go and consume it after they purchase it. We accomplished most of the things we wanted to accomplish. We can do more as far as research. Even though the bill that had opiates in it didn’t pass, it would certainly fit under one of the other definitions so I don’t think it’s going to be a major issue. Obviously opioid addiction is a central point of it. It’s not a cure-all for addiction but it’s pretty clear it helps people who do have addictions and it’s obviously a much friendlier drug.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

If we can get local governments to realize they have the authority, without any kind of state authorization, then each local jurisdiction is on their own. I have been told that the Clark County Commission has an opinion that they can do it. I am working on a state opinion that says they can do it. At that point, it will just be every city council and county commission on their own with what they want to do. In Carson City the police were in favor of it, the hotels were in favor of it, it was pretty well supported. People don’t realize without that, how are we going to sell it and then tell people you can’t use it? Or they are going to go right back to the hotels or walk down the Strip and that’s not something we want. And without having a place where you use it openly, it really encourages edibles, which if people know what they are doing it’s good but I don’t want people to come here and the first thing they ever do is try edibles. Those can be pretty scary if it’s the first time you have ever used some.

I am very proud to have carried on the family tradition. As far as we know, in checking around the country, we haven’t found any other family with four generations serving in a legislature. There may be somebody but we aren’t aware of that. But it’s a very small position not a fulltime job or anything but it’s still kind of fun to see yourself as part of a family tradition and part of Nevada.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

That’s why I love the marijuana thing because to me if you look back at the history of Nevada we have always been the outlaws, we have always done things other states didn’t want to do. During the Depression we had divorce, we had gambling. We have had all the vices, that’s what we are famous for and it seems like marijuana is probably the last vice we can get on top of and kind of set ourselves away from other places.

<div class="panel-body">

I think we did. We looked at Colorado and Arizona when we were writing the law, we looked for the best things out there, and said let’s go ahead and start with the best since we are starting from scratch. Testing seemed like the way to go. It really does set us apart, Oregon just found out they aren’t testing for pesticides and they have got a real problem there. Colorado is finally getting around to full scale testing and they have got issues. We really do have the best quality control of any place.

The one thing that is my other big issue right now is destroying Glen Canyon Dam. I had a bill in the last two sessions, it’s just a resolution, but it calls on the Nevada Legislature to ask for a study about Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell and whether it should be destroyed. Glen Canyon is the dam that meets Lake Powell above the Grand Canyon on the Colorado River. It works in conjunction with Hoover Dam at Lake Mead, we have these two big artificial bodies of water but the truth is there is not enough water for both lakes so from my perspective we need to get rid of the one which is the Glen Canyon Dam. We got the bill through the Assembly but it died in the Senate, it’s a really fun issue. It’s one of those things where we are kind of looking down the road but that’s one of the issues I have been working on very hard.

<div class="panel-body">

In 2013, I had a goal of doing medical marijuana but really didn’t know how it was going to shape out. This time going into the session we knew exactly what we wanted to do which was to have an early start, merge the two systems, get the tax structure in place, and even though we had a lot of ups and downs, that’s exactly what we accomplished which is huge because Colorado has a medical system and a recreational system with two separate inventories, two separate controls, it’s a mess. The fact that we combined the two and you can just walk into the dispensary and depending on which card you show, that’s what your tax rate is and it’s all one product is really fantastic. It’s really going to make the industry perfect as far it’s good for them and it’s going to diversify the products that are available. It just makes life so much simpler, they can really focus on producing and selling cannabis which will generate a lot of taxes, hopefully.

I would have so say it was clearly the 2013 medical marijuana program, it’s the one that has really changed Nevada and I have to say if I hadn’t been involved, it wouldn’t have happened, at least, at that time. It was going to eventually happen but it was one of those things where I was at the right place at the right time. It really worked out beyond anyone’s dreams.

		<title>WEED EMERGENCY AVERTED Nevada’s Marijuana Distribution Problem Partially Solved</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although the Nevada Department of Taxation has issued a call for the Nevada Tax Commission to issue emergency regulations for recreational marijuana distribution today at 1 p.m., part of the distribution quandary is already moot.</p>
<p>Blackbird Logistics Corporation, one of five companies who applied for a recreational marijuana distribution license in May, had its state inspection last Friday and received its distribution license yesterday. They are now &ldquo;good to go,&rdquo; according to Tim Conder, CEO of Blackbird. Conder was told by the state that the emergency regulations don&rsquo;t apply to Blackbird and upon receiving his distribution license he can start making distribution runs immediately. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As of Monday afternoon Peggy Arquilla, president of West Coast Wine &amp; Spirits and one of the five applicants for a marijuana distributorship, hadn&rsquo;t been contacted by the state for inspection and says, &ldquo;it really doesn&rsquo;t matter because come Thursday it could all be a moot point. The reality of it is if the Governor signs his emergency rule around legislation on Thursday -- they just continue to keep enacting regulations to go around the initiative. Every time it doesn&rsquo;t go their way, they hold another emergency session which is what they are doing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are two very separate issues at hand. According to a press release issued July 7, emergency regulations are necessary to provide a structure to allow the Department of Taxation to determine whether there are enough liquor wholesalers to serve the marijuana distribution market.&nbsp;&ldquo;Those emergency regs &ndash; all they do is provide the Department with a way to define sufficiency,&rdquo; says Conder. &ldquo;They are a means to solve the problem but they don&rsquo;t solve the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s one issue and will be decided this afternoon by the Nevada Tax Commission. The other issue is actual licensing of distributors so dispensaries have the ability to restock shelves and not run out of product. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Blackbird&rsquo;s Conder is not concerned from his end, saying, &ldquo;We will be able to get every dispensary in the state stocked and keep them running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is good news for dispensaries. Some are running out of product but there are those who have adequate supply. &ldquo;I would say we have about a good month and maybe a little more,&rdquo; says Demetri Kouretas of The Grove, noting, &ldquo;I'll have product to distribute once the ban is lifted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Same is true for Shango. &ldquo;It was definitely an insane first week but we&rsquo;re doing great,&rdquo; says Shango's Virginia Martino. &ldquo;We are not running out of product and we will have product to move once this distribution model gets up and running.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<h2>ARKANSAS</h2>Patients and caregivers can begin enrolling in Arkansas’ medical marijuana program now, although cards will not be immediately available. While patients can apply for program enrollment now, their ID cards will not be issued until 30 days before medical cannabis becomes available from dispensaries for purchase. The Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission estimates that dispensaries should be open by the end of the year or early 2018. The cost for a patient card is a nonrefundable $50 application fee. Caregivers must also undergo a $34 criminal history check. Due to an amendment to the program by the Legislature, members of the Arkansas National Guard and the U.S. military are not permitted to enroll in the program as either patients or caregivers.

<h2>HAWAII</h2>
Hawaii Governor David Ige signed a bill to expand the existing medical marijuana dispensary program. H.B. 1488 adds rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis to the list of qualifying conditions and allows patients and caregivers to access testing facilities. Patients and caregivers will be allowed to cultivate three additional plants of any maturity, for a total of 10 plants. The phasing out of caregivers’ ability to grow marijuana plants for patients has been pushed back five years, to the end of 2023. The new law, which went into effect on June 29, also authorizes the Department of Health to permit current licensees to open one additional dispensary — for a possible total of 24 statewide — and allows them to cultivate more plants at their production sites. It also amends certain deadlines and relaxes restrictive laboratory standards to accelerate implementation.

<h2>LOUISIANA</h2>
In June, Governor John Bel Edwards signed SB 35 into law, Senator Yvonne Colomb’s bill to prevent workers employed in the medical cannabis sector from facing felony criminal charges for going to work, which is a change to legislation that was first enacted in 1978. Legislators still need to fix other medical regulations. Specifically, the state continues to disallow the vaporization of cannabis, and state regulations actively require doctors to put their DEA licenses at risk in order to recommend patients for the program. Meanwhile, the two universities granted licenses to operate marijuana cultivation centers continue to move forward; Louisiana State University has indicated it expects medical cannabis to be available for patients before the end of the year.

<h2>NEW YORK</h2>
The New York Senate took an important step toward improving the state’s medical marijuana program by passing S 5629, which would add post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a qualifying condition. The Assembly had already overwhelmingly passed an identical bill, A 7006 in May (131-8). The Senate passed S 5629 50-13. The Senate’s approval means the bill now heads to Governor Cuomo’s desk. Twenty-six of the 29 states with medical marijuana programs allow patients with PTSD to qualify. In one of the states that do not, Alaska, marijuana is legal and regulated for adults 21 and older. Bills to add PTSD to state medical marijuana programs have been approved and signed into law in Colorado and Vermont this year. Legislation to add PTSD has also been approved in both chambers of the New Hampshire Legislature and is currently awaiting the governor’s signature.

<h2>WEST VIRGINIA</h2>
West Virginia’s limited medical marijuana law officially took effect in July, although patients will not benefit from the new law for two more years. Passed earlier this year and signed into law by Governor Jim Justice in April, Senate Bill 386, also known as the West Virginia Medical Cannabis Act, will allow seriously ill patients to access medical marijuana if their doctors recommend it once the program is up and running. Qualified patients will be allowed to access cannabis-infused products, such as oils, pills and tinctures, but will not be allowed to grow their own cannabis or possess marijuana in herbal form. Dispensaries will not be allowed to sell marijuana-infused edibles, but cannabis products could be mixed into food or drinks by patients themselves. Vaporization (of oils) is allowed, but smoking is prohibited.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Justin Alexander</h4>

<p>The sweet taste of nostalgia. It suddenly hangs in the air. Maybe it&rsquo;s because recreational cannabis became legal on July 1 or, perhaps, we are all just collectively hankering for a time when things were simpler. With recreational cannabis now available legally, a lot of people who tried marijuana when they were coming of age or experimenting in college are in search of those carefree days. They aren&rsquo;t just seeking reminders of days gone by, but for a way to revisit those times. However much they would like to relive their younger days, some may be hesitant because they wouldn&rsquo;t have the same experience. Concerned that today&rsquo;s strains are more potent than what they enjoyed back in the day, consumers are on the hunt for old-school strains with lower THC ratios. Depending on what decade you might have participated in the marijuana culture, THC could range anywhere from below 10 percent to somewhere in the low 20s. <em>elevate</em> has rounded up some of the market&rsquo;s most prevalent legacy strains from the &lsquo;60s, &lsquo;70s, &lsquo;80s, &lsquo;90s and aughts for a guide that seen through the lens of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Kabunky Klear&rsquo;s Acapulco Gold cartridge</strong></p>
<p>Swinging since the flower power of the &lsquo;60s, the origin of this strain is reflected in its moniker: Acapulco, Mexico. Commonly referenced in film and television, the name alone jars memories of a much simpler time&mdash;but it is becoming rare because it is difficult to grow inside. The effects of smoking are dually healthy for the mind and body. &ldquo;Kabunky's newest addition [is] Acapulco Gold&mdash;engineered to provide a clean and convenient method for pain management,&rdquo; says Trevor Moss, Kabunky budtender. &ldquo;This cartridge contains no terps; meaning that while it may not deliver a trendy, candy-like flavor, one can enjoy the medicinal effects while avoiding couch-lock or becoming anxious.&rdquo; Great for day or nighttime use, after smoking, notice that what ails&mdash;such as body pain, headache, or nausea&mdash;slips away. At a ratio of THC: 167 mg 33.33 percent and CBD: 490 mg 49 percent, you won&rsquo;t become sucked into a high that will drag you down for an extended period of time. Plus, non-functionality will never be an issue so use at home or away from home. A few puffs and you will be singing a happy song and doing a happy dance, reminiscent of the free love era from which it originated.</p>
<p><strong>Kannabis&rsquo;s Master Kush flower</strong></p>
<p>On the lips of smokers since the mid- to late &lsquo;70s, Master Kush is bred in Amsterdam and originates from the Hindu Kush region. It came up in the coffeeshops and is unique because it is a tetraploid strain&mdash;with four times the number of chromosomes&mdash;making it bigger and stronger in its biology. If you have trouble sleeping and need help falling into a deep and relaxing state then reach for the indica-based Master at 23.02 percent THCA. However, one of its best attributes is that, even with all that, you won&rsquo;t experience any mind numbness&mdash;in fact, quite the opposite. The taste is as down to earth as the high and can be characterized as deep and sweet. Recommended for patients who are fighting cancer, anxiety, depression, insomnia and lack of appetite, it is ideal for nighttime use. Also expect stimulated appetite so grab some popcorn!</p>
<p><strong>Durban Poison flower from Waveseer&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you just have to go with what you know. &ldquo;In the market today, cultivators have to really be tuned into the trends and requests of their patients,&rdquo; says Gareth Nelson, operations manager at Waveseer. &ldquo;It would be negligent to not want to experiment with some of the new hot ticket items, but strains like Durban Poison are tried and true.&rdquo; Dating back to the 1970s in South Africa, Durban Poison, a sativa, has had a long and steady rise to popularity throughout the years because of its super social characteristics. Perfect for those who need relief during the day, it holds notes of perfume, spice and chocolate. Like downing a double espresso without any of the jittery effects, this will wake you up and get you going. This is a type of high that everyone needs for mental clarity; plus, it is recommended for ailments such as nausea, headaches, pain, anxiety and stress. &ldquo;With the strain carrying over 150mg of terpenes, like terpinolene and ocimene, it suits many customers -- from those suffering with chronic pain to lack of agility,&rdquo; Nelson says of Durban Poison, which is 22.7 percent THC and .046 percent CBD. &ldquo;The strain lends a hand in helping reduce inflammation, increasing appetite, and, also, raising brain function.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Midnight from Tikun Olam&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The beautiful purple flowers may be the first thing you notice about Israeli cannabis cultivator Tikun Olam&rsquo;s Midnight but based on its low THC content, its vibe will transport you back to the &rsquo;80s. &ldquo;Midnight was developed as a THC/CBD balanced strain to specifically address certain medical issues,&rdquo; says Jyl Ferris, the company&rsquo;s creative director. &ldquo;Tikun Olam has developed its strains as a result of double-blind medical studies and anecdotal results from [a] nurse-run clinic.&rdquo; This strain is especially popular with Baby Boomers who used cannabis as teens and are now returning to it for medicine. At equal parts THC:CBD, running at approximately 8-12 percent for each, it is also recommended for those who are less experienced with cannabis, especially older patients. &ldquo;Veterans use Midnight as a daytime option,&rdquo; Ferris says. &ldquo;It has an uplifting and invigorating effect and may help with mild pain, gastrointestinal diseases like Crohn&rsquo;s disease and colitis, Fibromyalgia, cancer, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and PTSD.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Green Crack from State Flower Cannabis&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>With origins out of Athens, Georgia in the 1990s, the hybrid Green Crack strain migrated to California later that decade and the rest is history&mdash;thanks to Snoop Dogg changing its name from Green Kush. It is thought to be a cross of an &rsquo;89 SSSC Skunk #1 and an unknown Afghani indica. &ldquo;It wasn't until about 2003 that it became one of the most commercially viable and sought-after strains in California,&rdquo; says Daniel Wacks, co-founder of State Flower Cannabis. &ldquo;There are many phenotypes floating around that vary greatly in terms of potency. Our pheno typically ranges from 17-23 percent THC.&rdquo; State Flower has been growing it for nearly 15 years, Wack says, and the demand from patients just keeps accelerating. All the buzz around this product is directly related to its uplifting properties&mdash;this is pure sunshine. Expect sharp energy and focus and an unparalleled mental buzz. On the palate, find notes of mango, grapefruit and jelly beans. &ldquo;Green Crack is the perfect daytime medication for patients treating fatigue, stress, and depression,&rdquo; adds Wacks. Feel your mind elevate among the clouds as the urge to get stuff done becomes a top priority.</p>
<p><strong>Kynd Cannabis Company&rsquo;s Sour Diesel cartridge&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Sour Diesel, a hybrid strain that promotes alertness and mental clarity, came to prominence in the early &rsquo;90s as a possible descendent from Chemdawg 91 and Super Skunk. Most people never forget their first Sour Diesel experience because it does indeed capture the pungent and intoxicating scent of diesel fuel. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fast-acting strain, and its dreamy effects [make it] absolutely deserving of its legendary status,&rdquo; says Mark Pitchford, CEO and owner Kynd Cannabis Company. &ldquo;With long-lasting relief from pain, stress, and depression, it&rsquo;s a leading choice for medical patients.&rdquo; Devotees characterize this as a &ldquo;Jedi level&rdquo; high that makes you happy, uplifted and euphoric all while promoting relaxation but not inducing sleepiness at a THC of 76.5 percent and CBD of .15 percent. This is a strain of the people as most everyone can appreciate the lack of couch lock and the way it helps you seize the day. Capturing this in cartridge form has not only put a new generation in touch with its legacy, but also sparked nostalgia in long-time smokers.</p>
<p><strong>High Roller OG flower from Las Vegas Cannabis</strong></p>
<p>Cannabis lovers have been consuming High Roller OG since the late &rsquo;90s and the strain name itself is a great one for Las Vegas devotees, where everyone wants to feel like a high roller. The genetics are from Afghani and Northern Lights #5. &ldquo;High Roller OG is the definition of a legacy strain -- I have had this cut since the summer of 2000,&rdquo; says Las Vegas Cannabis&rsquo; Brian Schwager. &ldquo;The THC potency has ranged from 20 to 27 percent. The terpene profile of this strain is exquisite&mdash;high in B-Myrcene, B-Caryophyllene, Limonene and a-Humulene.&rdquo; The High Roller, represents the best of both worlds without being too much of one thing. It elevates into a full body high while still helping you to maintain focus. The buds are super sticky have a super skunky aroma and it is a very potent smoke so a little goes a long way. Schwager says word-of-mouth regarding strains has become an important marketing factor <br /> in the weed world, but he still stresses that it is all about the grow and that strains can be very profound based on that factor. &ldquo;People look for strains that they hear and read about but if they are not grown and cured correctly than it can cause a lot of confusion of what the strain should actually be,&rdquo; explains Schwager.</p>
<p><strong>Remedy&rsquo;s Blue Dream&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Quite literally a dream come true for daytime smokers, Blue Dream came to fruition in the early aughts. Its genetic origins are Blueberry indica and Haze sativa. This was, of course, the era before the world was so weed savvy and, while we have always loved this strain, it wasn&rsquo;t until much later that we fully realized why. This sativa-dominant hybrid provides a rare form of energized pain relief in a sweet and delicious package. Gently coaxing the mind into a state of engagement, there is nothing in this slow smoking varietal that could be considered heavy or sedative. &ldquo;Most favorable is the taste and smell of the blueberry, and the overall calming effect for both body and brain,&rdquo; says Chris Welch, cultivation manager, Silver Sage Wellness. A great strain for both beginners and experienced smokers to explore, it packs a THC punch with a level of 28.18 percent. One hit and you will be floating in a pleasant and lucid dream, similar to the effects of how one feels after an invigorating guided meditation.</p>
<p><strong>Cannabiotix&rsquo;s Bubble Gum</strong></p>
<p>Cannabiotix has been growing the clone-only Bubble Gum strain for about 12 years, but it has been said the strain originated in Indiana and then migrated around the country before heading to Holland. &ldquo;The overall effect and flavor profile are really what makes it special. It's definitely one of our more original, old-school cuts like the Super Silver Haze and Master Kush,&rdquo; says Neema Samari, cofounder and chief operating officer of Cannabiotix. &ldquo;Those are all strains that we've had in the fold for over 10 years.&rdquo; Smoking this strain will really put you at ease. It is a very relaxing and euphoric high that starts in the head and then hits the body. &ldquo;Anybody that's smoked it, knows that the effects are very heavily indica leaning,&rdquo; says Samari of Bubble Gum which is 22.57 percent THC and .039 percent CBD. &ldquo;Gives heavy eyelids, total body relaxation, and a couch-melt feeling.&rdquo; Bubble Gum is as its same suggests, a sweet smell equal to its sweet high. &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&ldquo;Living here literally feels like the sun on your face if you have been in the dark cold winter for a long time,&rdquo; explains 42-year-old Connie Rose of her life in Nevada. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Connie Rose moved to Las Vegas in 2013 after living in Indiana her entire life. But it wasn&rsquo;t just living in the cold Midwest that Rose metaphorically references. She also alludes to living with HIV, which she acquired from her husband 21 years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At my first appointment with my infections disease doctor she introduced herself and said she had just transferred from UCLA and that they were doing studies about how cannabis slowed the progression of HIV,&rdquo; recalls Rose. &ldquo;She asked if I smoked it, I said I didn&rsquo;t, and she said I highly recommend that you start and added that if we were in California she would write me a prescription right now. So, I went home and started smoking cannabis. Of course, it wasn&rsquo;t medical grade back then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only was it not medical grade, but it tasted like soap. &ldquo;They were shipping it to us in boxes of soap because it was still being smuggled in. Those poor people, that&rsquo;s how they still live. I have waited my whole life just to be able to get medical grade cannabis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At one point, Rose grew her own cannabis when she was still living in Indiana. &ldquo;I only grew one or two plants at a time. I was just trying to cut down on costs by growing my own and not have to buy crappy weed that tasted like soap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, she was caught and charged with cultivation in 2010. &ldquo;I started growing my own and got in trouble for one plant with three leaves,&rdquo; she reveals with a laugh. &ldquo;Growing it was illegal but buying it came with a higher charge. I received a year probation and house arrest.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In spite of the challenges involved with using a federally illegal drug, the upside is cannabis has kept Rose&rsquo;s HIV in check. &ldquo;In 21 years, I have never had a problem with my HIV. I have always been very healthy. In 1996 you weren&rsquo;t given medication unless your T-cells were under 500. Without getting HIV medication my only option was to control this virus holistically so I used cannabis. My T-cells never dropped below 1,000 and my viral load never got higher than 200,000 and there are people, who in the first year of testing, have a million-count viral load. I can&rsquo;t prove that it was the cannabis that was slowing the progression but something was keeping my viral load at 200,000 and it not going to one million.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had it not been for Rose&rsquo;s doctor advising her to try cannabis, she never would have. &ldquo;I grew up in Indiana and I grew up being told pot is bad, that&rsquo;s drugs. So, I literally grew up never doing it. I drank because that was legal, I didn&rsquo;t even smoke cigarettes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite her upbringing, Rose decided it was in her best interest to give cannabis a try. &ldquo;I stood there thinking am I going to believe a doctor from L.A. or am I going to believe these hypocrites who don&rsquo;t know anything about marijuana? All it took was her telling me and me knowing she was a doctor from UCLA -- I took her word for it and I have been blessed ever since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although admittedly blessed, Rose has experienced her share of dark days. &ldquo;I used to live with so much pain, I was tired 100 percent of the time. I finally reached a point in my life where I want to live, living with HIV in Indiana I didn&rsquo;t want to live. But I just couldn&rsquo;t die, I wasn&rsquo;t that sick, I tried multiple times but now that I am here and I live somewhere so free -- in a place so accepting and encouraging -- I will do whatever it takes,&rdquo; she says of living in Las Vegas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That acceptance has allowed Rose a fresh start she could have never imagined. &ldquo;I only live on $1000 a month and I can survive in Las Vegas. Anyone can start over here, I came here and became a writer and I have never been a writer in my life,&rdquo; she says of her regular writing gig with A&amp;U, an AIDS magazine. &ldquo;My life is completely different now. I attribute that to moving to Nevada and a complete environment change and gaining access to medical grade cannabis because I don&rsquo;t take half of the pills I took in the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Due to Rose&rsquo;s limited budget she was turned on to ShowGrow dispensary&rsquo;s &lsquo;Patients Helping Patients&rsquo; program that subsidizes medical marijuana patient cards. She applied and got her patient card within two weeks. Before that Rose was buying marijuana on the street because she couldn&rsquo;t afford a card.</p>
<p>She uses between a half and full gram of cannabis daily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t use very much. I use RSO oil. Sometimes if I can afford it, I use the concentrate. I am trying to medicate at a cellular level and to do that you have to eat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She prefers sativa because she deals with fatigue from living with HIV. &ldquo;If I am having a high anxiety day or because I live with psychosis issues from all the trauma of living with all the horrible things people do to you over 21 years of living with HIV, I deal with a little bit of crazy but not in a bad way. Kind of like if you don&rsquo;t laugh at it, you cry kind of stuff. On those days, I use an indica or a hybrid. I have slept so much of my life, I don&rsquo;t want to sleep anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since moving here my life has completely changed for the better and people are so accepting of the fact that I use medical cannabis. I don&rsquo;t hide it. I volunteer multiple places and they all know I am smoking medical cannabis, they all know I am part of a program. They know me personally and they know that I literally see it as medicine and I have from day one,&rdquo; explains Connie Rose, who volunteers at The Center and for AFAN. &ldquo;I love that about Las Vegas, I love that if you do something within reason people are so understanding and accepting and non-judgmental. I would rather volunteer for a company who knows my status than ever have to work for anybody again that I have to lie about who I am. That&rsquo;s the point I am in my life.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By chef Yzabetta Sativa </h4>
<br>
<br>
<p>In her newest cookbook, &ldquo;Baked 2,&rdquo; chef Yzabetta Sativa has compiled over 80 cannabis recipes. Dividing them into dairy-free, gluten-free, sugar-free, and vegan recipes, Sativa&rsquo;s cookbook is for people who want to eat their high without sacrificing good taste.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sativa was a lifelong smoker who found that ingesting cannabis prolonged the effects on her system and allowed her to avoid unhealthy smoke inhalation. As a chef, she recognized that others could benefit from healthier, diet conscious, and delicious recipes so she began supplying edible cannabis treats to Compassion Clubs and her experience eventually led to compiling this cookbook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What truly pushed me to write the cookbook was that I couldn&rsquo;t quit smoking cigarettes without stopping smoking pot as well,&rdquo; acknowledges Sativa on the cookbook&rsquo;s introduction page, who notes she hasn&rsquo;t smoked anything in over a decade. &ldquo;When I started experimenting with different recipes to get high without the lung damage, I asked a lot of people to test my recipes with me and I discovered I wasn&rsquo;t the only one with a passion for edibles. Many people would prefer to eat pot rather than smoke it.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Cornucopian Vegetable Salad </h2>
<h3>Five-a-day in a brand-new way</h3>
<h4>INGREDIENTS:</h4>
1 head of broccoli, broken into florets
1 head of cauliflower, broken into florets
2 cups cherry tomatoes
1 medium English cucumber, sliced
1 medium Vidalia onion, thinly sliced
1 cup fresh carrots, sliced 
1 cup ripe olives, drained and sliced
1/2 cup pimiento-stuffed olives
1/2 cup Mary Jane Mayo 
(see accompanying recipe)
2 Tablespoons red wine vinegar
3 Tablespoons fresh lemon juice
1/3 cup “Oregano” Oil 
(see accompanying recipe)
1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon dried basil
1-1/2 teaspoons white sugar
2 ground cloves garlic, chopped 
2 cups mozzarella, shredded



<h4>Directions:</h4>
<p>In a large salad bowl, combine broccoli, cauliflower, tomatoes, cucumber, onion, carrots, and both types of olives.</p>
<p>In a small bowl, whisk together Mary Jane Mayo, vinegar, lemon juice, &ldquo;Oregano&rdquo; Oil, Worcestershire sauce, oregano, basil, sugar, and garlic until evenly combined.</p>
<p>Pour salad dressing over vegetable mixture and toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Stir in the mozzarella just before serving.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Mary Jane Mayo</h2>
<h3>The real thing, now medicated</h3>
<h4>INGREDIENTS:</h4>
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon of finely minced garlic
1 Tablespoon of freshly squeezed 
lime juice
1 teaspoon of prepared Dijon mustard
3/4 cup of “Oregano” Oil (see accompanying recipe)
sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper 
to taste 


<h4>Directions:</h4>
<p>Mix egg, garlic, lime juice, and Dijon mustard together in a blender or food processor. Blend until smooth, then blend on low speed while pouring the &ldquo;Oregano&rdquo; Oil into the blender in a fine stream as the mixture emulsifies and thickens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep refrigerated and be aware that one tablespoon of MJ Mayo is enough to get you baked.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>“Oregano” Oil </h2>
<h3>An infusion with a real kick</h3>
<h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
2 cups of olive oil
1/2 ounce of good cannabis ground to a powder (grind the cannabis up using 
a coffee grinder)


<h4>Directions:</h4>
<p>Place the powdered cannabis and oil in a regular crockpot. A mini crockpot&nbsp;</p>
<p>(11/2-quart) is best. Regular size crockpots are only good if you&rsquo;re making a lot of &ldquo;Oregano&rdquo; Oil at one time. Make sure the heat on the crockpot is on the lowest setting.</p>
<p>Heat the oil and powdered cannabis together in the crockpot on low for at least 12 hours, but ultimately for 24 hours, covered. Allow the oil to cool then strain through a strainer, lined with a layer of cheesecloth, into a large bowl. Twist the pulp in the double layer of cheesecloth to get out all the oil. Refrigerate to quicken cooling. When cool, pour the oil back into its bottle, or another clean bottle, making sure to label it; you don&rsquo;t want someone to mistake it for normal oil and accidentally dose themselves.</p>
<p>I personally don&rsquo;t strain the oil when it&rsquo;s done, if not out of abject laziness then for the added fiber to my diet. The only thing you have to be careful of, if you choose not to strain, is that 1/3 cup of &ldquo;Oregano&rdquo; Oil with powdered cannabis in it does not actually measure 1/3 cup of &ldquo;Oregano&rdquo; Oil. I measure 1/3 cup plus a bit more, if you will, to even out the score.</p>
<p>It used to be that people would use &ldquo;shake&rdquo; or low-grade pot for making &ldquo;oregano&rdquo; oil. However, more recent studies show that the superiority, potency and staying power of the final product are greatly improved by using good cannabis as opposed to &ldquo;shake.&rdquo; In Canada we&rsquo;re able to purchase some wonderful hydroponically grown pot, which is my personal preference.</p>
<p>This &ldquo;Oregano&rdquo; Oil will keep a long time in the fridge and you can use it just as you would use any oil in any recipe, be it savory or sweet. You can enjoy it in the same regard that you would any other oil. Extra virgin olive oil is mostly used as a salad dressing and as an ingredient in salad dressings. It is also used with foods to be eaten cold. If uncompromised by heat, the flavor is stronger. It also can be used for saut&eacute;ing. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Seafood Ragout</h2>
<h3>Featuring the best flavors of the sea</h3>
<h4>INGREDIENTS:</h4>
1/3 cup “Oregano” Oil (see accompanying recipe)
4 ground garlic cloves, minced
3 stalks of celery, chopped
1 large onion, sliced
1 (15-ounce) can of whole tomatoes
1 cup balsamic vinegar
1 lb. lobster tails
1 lb. sole fillets
1 lb. medium shrimp, peeled and deveined 
3 Tablespoons lemon juice
3 cups Pinot Grigio
5 cups fish stock
2 bay leaves
3 sprigs of fresh basil leaves, roughly torn 
4 Tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped
sea salt and pepper to taste


<h4>Directions:</h4>
<p>Cut lobster and sole into one-inch chunks. Combine lobster and sole with shrimp and lemon juice, set aside.</p>
<p>Heat &ldquo;Oregano&rdquo; Oil in a large stew pot over medium heat. Add garlic, celery and onions, cooking until translucent. Pour in tomatoes, vinegar, and wine and let liquid come to a simmer. Cook for about 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pour in fish stock and add marinated seafood and fish along with basil, bay leaves, and parsley. Simmer ragout for about 20 minutes, until lobster has cooked through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Season ragout with salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately with crostini. This recipe is enough to get four people baked.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Please remember when cooking with medicinal cannabis you are cooking with a medicine and the medicine amount and portions of the food ingested should always be taken into consideration. Always start out with small portions or doses and wait 30 minutes to an hour before eating any additional portions of food that has been medicated.</em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>In the Land of  Herb and Honey</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Timothy Keenan will be the first to tell you he is a self-proclaimed honey aficionado. Growing up, Keenan&rsquo;s parents were beekeeping enthusiasts who kept a couple of backyard hives. &ldquo;Those are some of my earliest and fondest memories of collecting honey when I was a child so that kind of stuck with me throughout the years,&rdquo; explains Keenan. &ldquo;As I have traveled the world over the last 10 years I have tried to collect as many honeys as I could -- like honey from Africa and Amazon and southeast Asia. I have a love for it, same as cannabis in a sense.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, it only makes sense that Keenan, who as Sales/Outreach Manager for Cannabella, would take the lead on the edible company&rsquo;s honey product line when it was proposed earlier this year. &ldquo;When we decided to do honey, I was lucky enough to be put in charge of finding the honey I wanted. I looked at different varietals, and looked at the various regions they were from, such as orange blossom versus sage,&rdquo; says Keenan of his search which began in February. &ldquo;I was after color, consistency, and flavor -- I wanted light and floral almost fruity versus a dark, robust honey. I wanted it to be nice and light and local so we can all benefit from local pollen for allergies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During his research Keenan tried varietals from a half-dozen beekeepers with most being from Northern Nevada. &ldquo;Varietals will change throughout the year based on different harvests and different places. I ask what region it&rsquo;s from. It&rsquo;s not going to be 100 percent Manzanita Brush or Orange Blossom; as an example, bees only fly two to eight miles to get their honey. Beekeepers put all of their hives next to an orchard farm knowing that&rsquo;s where bees get a majority of their honey from and there might be a little bit of wildflower mixed in too.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keenan eventually selected a Manzanita Brush honey from Reno beekeeper Al Sindlinger who started with just two hives 20 years ago and now has 200 with some hives playing host to as many as 100,000 bees. &ldquo;In the summertime, I fight fires and I do the beekeeping in between all that. I keep the bees or more like they keep me,&rdquo; Sindlinger offers with a chuckle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He, too, got into beekeeping as a hobby but it quickly went from a sideline hobby to a sideline business that he spends an average of 30 to 40 hours a week on, depending on the time of year. &ldquo;I was living out in Elko and I had a garden and I really didn&rsquo;t have any pollinators for it. I had a bunch of cucumbers growing with no pollinators so I thought maybe I should get some bees to pollinate. That&rsquo;s kind of how it started. So, I picked up some books and taught myself through trial and error and I learned how to keep bees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now residing in the Reno area, Sindlinger starts the year by taking his bees to the almond orchards &ldquo;because that&rsquo;s kind of nice to help them build up. Almond contracts are kind of tricky because they want mid-summer strength bees at the first of February so you have to kind of keep your bees pretty healthy and stimulate them and feed them so they start building up,&rdquo; expounds Singlinger, who lets his bees collect their own honey and feed themselves. &ldquo;I will feed them sugar. I don&rsquo;t use high fructose corn syrup. I don&rsquo;t like the generic connotations of feeding them that. I think it wreaks havoc on a bee&rsquo;s immune system.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an average year, Sindlinger produces between 10 and 12 55-gallon barrels of honey. Although in recent years it has been on the lesser side due to the five-year drought that plagued Northern Nevada. &ldquo;It was discouraging during the drought because a lot of your bees die off. We had a drought from 2012 to 2016 that just broke this past year. I had to move my beehives and be kind of crafty during the drought and find places way up in the mountains where there was a little bit of water and moisture so the bees could make the honey,&rdquo; adds Sindlinger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noting honey has medicinal qualities, Sindlinger shares a story of a couple of people with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease who started using his Rabbit Brush honey and were, in turn, able to stop using medication for the disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The medicinal qualities of honey made it a perfect fit for Cannabella&rsquo;s mission of providing the highest quality, scientifically-based health products to cannabis dispensaries throughout Nevada. Noting his values align with Cannabella&rsquo;s, Keenan explains, &ldquo;part of my personal motivation for looking at things like honey or products with natural sugars is my mom is diabetic and so this is something that I can offer to her that is more diabetic-friendly with the natural sugars,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>In addition to diabetics, Keenan notes that Cannabella&rsquo;s honey works well for cancer patients. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s best used for people who can&rsquo;t tolerate eating or have throat or stomach cancer or just have digestive issues in general. They can&rsquo;t handle an edible and don&rsquo;t want to smoke but I have been hearing feedback from cancer patients that it is the only thing that they can consume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the lighter side of the ailment spectrum, Cannabella&rsquo;s Sierra Nevada honey is also used by those who prefer not to smoke, seasonal allergy sufferers, and as a sleep aid used in tea at nighttime or taken by the spoonful. Keenan&rsquo;s favorite way to eat honey is straight. &ldquo;I am such a honey fan I enjoy it in lieu of candy. When I get that sweet tooth at night, I will feel a lot less guilty having a teaspoon of honey instead of eating a Snickers bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Noting he has a palate for honey and cannabis but not for beer, wine or anything else, Keenan is &ldquo;pleased with what we have out there because it&rsquo;s nice and light. It doesn&rsquo;t have an overly weedy flavor. I like our honey over others. I have tried many cannabis honeys and many are very cannabis forward, very weedy flavored. We wanted something more subtle with just enough cannabis flavor to know it&rsquo;s in there. That&rsquo;s the way our whole product line is, there&rsquo;s just enough of the cannabis flavor to know it&rsquo;s in there,&rdquo; he says, adding that it needs to be good enough for mom or grandma.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keenan sees the possibility of more Cannabella honey varietals. &ldquo;We might look into different flavors or a darker more robust Rabbit Brush honey which has medicinal properties and do that in the future,&rdquo; he reveals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But for now, it appears Keenan has found his sweet spot. &ldquo;Cannabis and honey have been two of my loves for the majority of my life and to see them come together and get attention is wonderful,&rdquo; concludes Keenan. &ldquo;The more people we can help, the better I will feel about it all.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Chef Deborah L. Costella shares a bittersweet story of healing and love in the age of cannabis. As Costella reveals her journey of cooking with marijuana to feed the comfort cravings of the ailing, she discovers a homecooked meal can be just the salve to soothe a broken body.</i>
<p>We all heard him whistling from the bathroom. A mindless melody so pleasant it reminded me of the orchestra of birds that sing and chirp each morning outside my bedroom window. But it wasn&rsquo;t morning, rather it was dusk. Mother had just walked in bearing a bottle of red wine, Aliya was sitting on the full-size bed we had moved to the living room weeks prior. It now served as the couch. His new bed was one of those rented hospital versions. It served his needs better now. Aliya sat cross-legged, her head down, knitting yet another hat for him. He was always cold. I stood in the small kitchen waiting for the grapeseed oil I had just poured into the cast iron skillet to shimmer indicating it was hot enough. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Cut up pieces of chicken had been marinating in a buttermilk bath overnight, a mixture of dried herbs and spices merrily swimming in the tangy milk anticipating their future as supporting cast in this special meal. Steamed Yukon Golds sat at the ready in a large mixing bowl awaiting their mashing with more of the reserved milk. Onion and garlic powder, salt, pepper, and a good dollop of sour cream would be added to the potatoes making for the richest and creamiest of side dishes. He&rsquo;s loved mashed potatoes since he was a baby. There was a jar of commercially prepared gravy sitting on the counter. A blatant indication of my inability to make gravy that doesn&rsquo;t separate. A crisp green salad was chopped, tossed and wrapped, chilling in the fridge. &nbsp;</p>
<p>He asked me to prepare this selection of comfort foods the day before. I pointed out digesting such a heavy meal would be nearly impossible considering his current state of health. But his heartfelt plea, accentuated by the look in those big brown eyes, expressed such desire, my logic faded. So, I conceded. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I wondered, as I moved pieces of chicken from tins of dry, wet, dry to the now hot oil, if my brother held the same fond food memory I did. As children, our father instigated several days dedicated to the picking, slicing, pitting and drying of apricots. At the end of these long days we were rewarded with a meal of KFC. Our entire family, including grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins, reveled in this take-out feast of soggy fried chicken, one dimensional mashed potatoes, fluffy, air-like biscuits and too smooth gravy. But after a day of sweat, hard work and downright fun, the ending was always looked forward to and was always delicious. I never got around to asking Lawrence, but figured the memory must&rsquo;ve dwelled somewhere inside him, as it did <br /> within me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As adults he was the healthiest among us. Lawrence held the most sensible approach to eating. He applied little if any dressing to his salads. Ate only steel-cut oats with lots of nuts and fresh fruit mixed in for breakfast. Drank no alcohol and nary a piece of candy or dessert touched his lips. He consumed very little fat but rather ate tons of vegetables. So why was he the one struck with cancer? My siblings and I regularly consumed pounds of sugar, plenty of carbs, an abundance of bad fats and me, the worst, with my go-to dinner of wine and M&amp;Ms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If food really is medicine, why were we spared while my little brother suffered the indignities of cancer? How is it, the one who ate all the right foods, in the right quantities, in addition to climbing on his bike to cycle miles upon miles along Skyline and beyond, ended up sick? What kind of perfect storm raged undetected until we found ourselves standing behind and beside him as he faced off against chemotherapy, surgeries and more chemo? I still don&rsquo;t have an answer to that question. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But on this particular evening, now in his early 50s, wheelchair bound with tubes and bags attached to his torso like a makeshift hula skirt, Lawrence puttered in his bathroom whistling a happy tune. It was clear to Mother, Aliya and I, he was eager to partake of a meal prepared just for him. The aromatic scent of chicken frying in hot oil, the sound of thick gravy burping and bubbling on the stove, and eye-pleasing biscuits browning in the oven offered each of us a kind of emotional reprieve from our current reality. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I had occasionally spent time visiting and helping my brother in the months prior to this evening. But during the last three months of his life, I became a more prominent fixture in this gladiator&rsquo;s arena in his fight against cancer. Between changing bags, physical therapy, doctor&rsquo;s visits, errands and cooking, our days were very, very busy. However, by five o&rsquo;clock each evening, my brother would wheel himself from his favored spot, in front of the fireplace (an effort to warm his chilled bones), to a corner window and partake of his preferred medicine, marijuana. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As he gazed out the open window and lit his water pipe, he would call, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for your wine Webbie.&rdquo; Webbie, a childhood nickname derived from Debbie when he was a toddler, unable to pronounce Deborah. My parents allowed for Debbie, but evidently, he couldn&rsquo;t pronounce that either. He would open the widow wide, waving his hand to encourage the smoke to wind its way to the street below. He did this to appease the home-visiting doctors, nurses and therapists who made it clear they didn&rsquo;t condone smoking but understood the medicinal properties marijuana held for Lawrence and others like him. Especially in easing the pain and nausea my brother continuously suffered. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That evening as Lawrence made his way to the window, calling out the wine bell for Mother, Aliya <br /> and myself, I watched as he deeply inhaled the herbaceous medicine. By the time Lawrence was finished and secured his pipe back in the cupboard, Mother, Aliya and I had plated our dinner, then gathered together on the bed-couch for a make-shift picnic. Lawrence rolled up alongside us and balancing his plate on his lap, turned on &ldquo;Judge Judy.&rdquo; The four of us commenced eating. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Not even the scolding and admonishments from Judge Judy to those poor plaintiffs and defendants could drown out the &ldquo;mmmm&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;yum&rsquo;s&rdquo; emanating from my brother and the others. I smiled from ear to ear, happy I could give my brother something he so wanted. It was a simple and small gesture on my part but one with grand reward. I think of that night often. Mother can&rsquo;t talk about it without crying. That night was the last time any of us heard Lawrence whistle. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward almost a year after his passing, it suddenly occurs to me, I could&rsquo;ve easily done more to ensure my brother&rsquo;s food really did serve as medicine. I happened to be at a party with some friends. There was a woman I was introduced to whom I discovered went to the same college I attended, Foothill Junior College. Crazy as those meetings can turn out to be, she had heard of me, but not as Deborah Viariseo rather as Cosmic Muffin (another nickname, given to me for obvious reasons, if you know me). Someone standing nearby overheard our conversation and laughed then teasingly asked, &ldquo;So what kind of muffins were you cooking up?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s when it happened. Bells went off in my head, lights, bells, and sirens -- all of it. How could I not have thought to do that for Lawrence? Of course, back in those college days, I&rsquo;d thrown half a &ldquo;lid&rdquo; into a package of dry brownie mix, added oil, water and an egg then baked the mixture up according to package directions. I carefully frosted them with chocolate icing then dotted each brownie with an M&amp;M so people would know they were &ldquo;laced.&rdquo; This was my signature contribution to many a college party. Those days were long gone, and it hadn&rsquo;t occurred to me to cook with cannabis since. But in that moment, with the strobe light of ideas going off in my head, it was as if Lawrence was there asking me from wherever he was: &ldquo;Yeah, what about those muffins?&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>For over three years now I have been experimenting and honing my skills as a chef of healing foods. Taking cues from my brother, I prefer to focus on infusing foods that do a body good.&nbsp; Not just brownies, Rice Krispy treats, cookies and candies. Instead, I do my best to infuse foods that are healthy, more savory in nature. I prepare gluten-free, vegetarian, vegan, and of course, fried chicken. Whatever type of food is needed by those who have decided to integrate holistic medicine with traditional treatments. People who, like Lawrence, are suffering debilitating diseases, chronic pain or other maladies inhibiting their ability to fully think and function are told this is the &ldquo;new normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been my experience during recent years, as I prepare a variety of infused foods, how much good ingesting medical cannabis can do. From providing temporary pain relief in the form of a balm to reducing more severe pain from surgery and illness and bringing it to a level that is at least tolerable. Ingesting medical marijuana means no smoke in their lungs or the environment they spend their time in and seems to do a better job in alleviating nausea while increasing appetite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many are already familiar with Charlotte&rsquo;s Web, a well-known CBD-dominant strain bred to reduce seizures in a young child. It is this same medicine that when ingested in the form of food can help with insomnia, allowing much needed sleep to sweep into their ailing bodies. And, let&rsquo;s not forget the added dose of joy certain strains of medical marijuana can provide, juxtaposing a kind of paradigm shift in the mind and therefore the spirit by inducing a chuckle or eliciting laughter, a nearly forgotten response for many and their caregivers. How I wish I&rsquo;d thought to do this for Lawrence when he was here. Instead I do it for others. Because this I know for certain -- food really is medicine.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cosmic Muffin’s Infused Fried Chicken</h2>
<h4>Ingredients for Chicken Seasoning:</h4>
(Yield: 1 to 1-½ cups of this mixture)
2 Tbsp. cayenne pepper		
6 Tbsp. granulated garlic (not garlic salt)
3 Tbsp. paprika 			
3 Tbsp. onion powder
3 Tbsp. kief 				
2 Tbsp. dark brown sugar
2 Tbsp. kosher salt			
1 Tbsp. cracked pepper

<h4>Ingredients for Chicken and Marinade:</h4>
1  4 lb. whole chicken, cut into 8-10 pieces            
4 cups buttermilk – separated 
2 Tbsp. Frank’s Hot Sauce                                       
1 cup or bottle of dark beer - divided
¼ cup of Chicken Seasoning recipe (above)
4 cups infused grapeseed, peanut or vegetable oil 
for frying 

<h4>Ingredients for Dredging Flour:</h4>
2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour                     
¼ cup of Chicken Seasoning recipe (above)

<h4>Ingredients for Wet Mixture:</h4>
1 large or jumbo egg                                                
1 tsp. baking powder
½ tsp. baking soda                                                     
1 Tbsp. mustard

<h4>Ingredients for Glaze:</h4>
¼ cup of Chicken Seasoning recipe (above)
1 cup of reserved infused frying oil
Kosher salt to taste


<h4>Method:</h4>
<p>In a medium bowl, whisk together all ingredients for Chicken Seasoning, mixing well. Set aside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a very large bowl, combine 3 cups of buttermilk, hot sauce, &frac12; of beer and seasoning mix. Add chicken, making sure chicken pieces are completely submerged. Cover and place in fridge at least 4 hours or overnight. After chicken has been marinated, begin by placing a wire rack over a sheet pan, then set chicken pieces on rack to drain.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, whisk together flour and seasoning mix <br /> in a cake or pie pan. In a separate cake or pie pan, <br /> whisk together the remaining cup of buttermilk, the <br /> other half of the beer, egg, baking powder, baking soda and mustard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a heavy cast iron skillet or Dutch oven, over medium heat, add about 2 inches of infused oil and heat to about 350&deg;. Begin by dipping the chicken pieces, one at a time, into the flour mixture, coating all sides, then into the egg mixture. Shake off excess then place chicken, skin down first, into hot oil. Do not overcrowd the skillet/pot. Fry chicken until a rich brown crust has developed before turning, about 15-20 minutes per side. If your pot/pan is too small to hold all the chicken, allow the oil to heat back up to 350&deg; before adding the next batch. While chicken is cooking, add about 1 cup of frying oil to what&rsquo;s left of the seasoning mixture and whisk until smooth (this is your glaze). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Transfer fried chicken pieces to a clean cooling rack, set over a sheet pan and brush with prepared glaze. Sprinkle chicken, while still hot, with a dash of salt and serve hot or at room temperature.</p>
<p><em>Makes 8-10 servings with approximately 35 mg THC <br /> per serving.&nbsp;</em></p>

		<title>Evergreen Organix brings FlavRx vapes to Nevada marketplace</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In late July, Evergreen Organix introduced California-based vape brand FlavRx into the Nevada marketplace with a launch at Silver State Relief in Sparks. &ldquo;The Evergreen Organix model is to focus on the top, most winning strains and the things that consumers and patients like the most. So, with that in mind, we decided to create a strategic alliance with FlavRx,&rdquo; explained Jillian Nelson, Evergreen Organix Operations Manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it wasn&rsquo;t without first embarking on quite a bit of research before creating the strategic partnership. &ldquo;We tried various brands, did a lot research, and studied the four markets of Colorado, California, Oregon, and Washington. We found that the most volume and that the largest and most respected names came from California, even though they were medical,&rdquo; said Nelson. &ldquo;On the medical side, there were three that continuously shined, and one of those was FlavRx. We like the way they marketed, the way they branded themselves, and that they used topnotch ingredients. So, we did a California taste test and they were by far the most desired.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>A producer of medicinal cannabis oil for vaporizers and edibles, FlavRx is well-known for Tropical Trainwreck, which is the most popular in the California market, followed by Gorilla Glue, Blueberry, and Granddaddy Purple. FlavRx is focused specifically on the core component of the vaping experience, and as such, has created a line of lab-tested, strain-specific, solventless, and delicious oils. They offer 31 different strains, each with its own unique terpene profile, and ensure safe, clean products that are glycol-free, guaranteeing no PPMs or unwanted residuals.</p>
<p>"Our product is brand-new in the sense that no other competitor <br /> offers true strain-specific oils, nor has taken strides to ensure such consistent quality. It's critical that patients know what FlavRx is, what makes it special, and most importantly, where to find it," said Steven Dang, founder of FlavRx.</p>
<p>In addition to offering tasty strain-specific oils, FlavRx manufactures a quality vape cartridge product. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the things we tested with FlavRx,&rdquo; offered Nelson. &ldquo;Their cartridges have one of the lowest leak rates. We haven&rsquo;t had any problems, we have run them through heat testing and, so far, they have not failed. It goes to their ample experience, and that&rsquo;s another benefit to partnering with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a veteran of the cannabis industry with almost 10 years of experience, FlavRx &ldquo;has been through multiple types of cartridges over the years so we are leveraging off of their experience to deliver a quality product,&rdquo; explained Nelson. &ldquo;They also bring their expertise in the laboratory to allow us to properly manage our CO2 extraction and our short-path distillation process to not only service the vape pen market, but also to get us the highest quality of extracted and purified oil for our chocolate and candy products.&rdquo;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>JUICED-UP Getting the buzz on the next big  health trend</title>
		<link>https://elevatenv.com/juiced-up-getting-the-buzz-on-the-next-big-health-trend/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Julie Monteiro, RN, BSK</h4>
<p>Get ready to add the next big superfood to your juice concoction. <br /> Those who treat their bodies as a temple and leave no stone unturned when pursuing avenues of optimal health are adding fresh cannabis leaves to their green juicing regimen. <br /> Green juicing which primarily includes Popeye&rsquo;s favorite leafy greens of kale and <br /> spinach now has one more nutritionally-rich component in raw cannabis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many routes of administration for consuming cannabis, all of which are beneficial for the body in providing health and bringing balance. Choosing the best route for you as a patient will be dependent on a variety of factors that specifically fit your lifestyle and your desired outcome. I personally enjoy juicing raw cannabis leaves daily -- raw cannabis is cannabis that has been uncured and unheated -- simply for the fact that there are <br /> no psychoactive effects because to experience a psychoactive high from cannabis, the <br /> bud or leaves need to be heated. Also, as important, fresh cannabis provides more bang <br /> for your buck in its nutritional values and overall desired outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Juicing fresh cannabis leaves offers a natural approach to health and wellness in providing balance to your Endocannabinoid system (eCS). Cannabis leaves are particularly rich in phytocannabinoids CBDA and CBG, while juiced flower can offer the benefits of THC-A, or tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, which is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid found in raw and live cannabis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cannabinoids offer significant anti-inflammatory, neuroprotection, and pain relief benefits that are hard to get from &ldquo;activated&rdquo; or heat-processed cannabinoids like delta-9-THC and CBD. Additionally, the body tolerates larger dosages of cannabinoids <br /> when cannabis is consumed in the raw form providing <br /> a system-wide therapeutic and nutritional benefit. There&rsquo;s only one downside. Acquisition of fresh fan leaves from cannabis plants can be challenging. Nevada&rsquo;s testing requirements state that the moisture content of cannabis products must be less than 15 percent moisture to pass testing, and fresh leaves typically contain about 80 percent water, so they aren't available in dispensaries. For those who live in a state that allows personal marijuana cultivation, an outdoor greenhouse or indoor grow closet is recommended to produce fresh cannabis for juicing.</p>

<h2>Juhlzie Juice</h2>
<h4>INGREDIENTS:</h4>
½ cup water and/or fruit/vegetable juice (i.e. apple juice, carrot juice)
½ cup ice
6-8 berries (blueberries/raspberries/blackberries) 
2-4 strawberries
15 fresh cannabis leaves 
2 large raw buds (2-4 inches long) harvested when THC glands are clear (rather than amber/cloudy)
6-8 fresh spinach leaves
1-2 fresh asparagus stems
2 baby carrots
2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime or lemon juice 4oz. organic yogurt
1/8 tsp of powdered turmeric 
1-tablespoon honey/agave (used as a sweetener - if desired)




<h4>Instructions:</h4>
<p>Use a juicer or blender (i.e. NutriBullet or kitchen blender) to mix ingredients until well blended. Make sure ingredients don’t overheat as it may cause decarboxilation of the cannabis which gives you a euphoric “high.” Add water/ice as necessary for desired thickness. Makes two 16oz. servings. Store unused portion in covered container/jar in refrigerator for later use.</p>

<h4>Helpful Hints for Juicing Cannabis:</h4>
<ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
<li>Juiced cannabis should always be diluted with water or another type of fruit/vegetable juice, as it will be extremely acidic. Juice cuts down on the bitterness of the raw cannabis.</li>
<li>Plant material must be fresh. Leaves that have been dried or stored for extended periods are not recommended.</li>
<li>Most likely, your local dispensary will not have a fresh supply of raw cannabis available but many patients and caregivers do grow their own medicine.</li>
<li>When gathering ingredients, fresher is always better. Vegetables begin breaking down and losing valuable enzymes from the moment they are harvested. To get the most out of a juicing cannabis, it is recommended that only the freshest produce, including cannabis, be used.</li>
<li>Juicing has no inherent health risk, although you do want tobe careful to watch your sugar intake (especially if you are diabetic) as juicing has a fast absorption rate and may increase your sugar levels rapidly.</li>
<li>Be very careful to keep heat exposure to the plant as lowas possible to prevent psychoactive effects.</li>

		<title>Day One Ushering in recreational cannabis with State Senator Tick Segerblom</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Photo by Hector Leyva</h4>
<p>As the countdown to midnight approached Saturday, July 1, a line of over 1,000 people snaked around the 165,000-square-foot Reef Dispensary location at 3400 Western Avenue in Las Vegas. A DJ was spinning cannabis-centric tunes near the entrance as Nevada State Senator Richard &ldquo;Tick&rdquo; Segerblom arrived amidst the excitement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A flurry of media followed him inside where he&rsquo;d be the first legal recreational marijuana customer when the clock struck 12. As Nevada&rsquo;s biggest supporter of legalization, it was only apropos he would make the first purchase on the historic occasion. As fireworks punctuated the sky signaling &ldquo;Day 1&rdquo; of legalized recreational cannabis, Segerblom purchased the sativa strain named after him: Segerblom Haze.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very exciting,&rdquo; Segerblom tells <em>elevate</em> of the festivities. &ldquo;To see it actually happen and realizing that you can actually buy and use cannabis is pretty amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think the most rewarding thing was just the show of support we got from the community and how many people came out on opening night,&rdquo; says Matt Morgan, CEO of Reef Dispensaries/Tryke Companies. &ldquo;It had a huge wow factor to it and it made all the hard work leading up to that day definitely worth it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was impressed,&rdquo; Segerblom says of the turnout. &ldquo;We had no idea what it was going to be like. Our goal was to have it look like that but we weren&rsquo;t sure it would,&rdquo; he <br /> says. &ldquo;Obviously word had gotten out and the demand is <br /> out there and everyone was very excited. It was like New Year&rsquo;s Eve.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing Segerblom was wowed by? His strain namesake. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t actually try it early Saturday morning, but I have tried it and it works,&rdquo; he laughs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recreational cannabis had such a high demand in the first week that it created hiccups throughout the Valley thanks to liquor distributors not being prepared to handle distribution on July 1. While Nevada&rsquo;s medical cannabis business has a tried and tested process in getting product from growers and manufacturers to shelves, recreational rules prevented the recreational side of dispensaries from implementing the same system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The biggest problem is because we sold so much we&rsquo;re going to have to refill the dispensaries and to do that we have to have a distributor process in the works,&rdquo; says Segerblom. &ldquo;Right now the liquor distributors are the only game in town given the court ruling&hellip;so they need to expedite that process and get them up and running so they can deliver from the grows and from the edible companies to the dispensaries as soon as possible because some of the dispensaries are running on fumes right now they sold so much.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, unlike some dispensaries that sold out of product, Reef was prepared. &ldquo;We went into this thing with eyes wide open and we&rsquo;re pretty&mdash;I guess you could say flexible&mdash;on demand,&rdquo; says Morgan. &ldquo;We went in thinking the demand may be a two multiplier, maybe an eight multiplier, we didn&rsquo;t know for sure, but we were prepared for all scenarios and we were prepared to have an issue with transportation for a month or more if need be,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not allowed to transfer from one room to another, even in a vertically integrated site,&rdquo; Morgan explains. &ldquo;Essentially how the law is written is an alcohol distributor would have to come into the building and walk it from one room to another, which is about 100 feet,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s madness; makes no sense whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On July 7th numerous empty shelves prompted Governor Brian Sandoval to declare a cannabis state of emergency upon which the state&rsquo;s tax commission voted to expand distributor licenses to more than just liquor distributors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though the state is on board with making things run smoothly, as a good portion of the taxes from recreational will go to helping Nevada&rsquo;s next-to-last ranking schools, there are concerns that Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a vocal opponent of marijuana, may try to make an example out of Nevada and go after recreational cannabis. &ldquo;Personally I&rsquo;m not [worried],&rdquo; says Segerblom. &ldquo;I think if he wants to go after Nevada he&rsquo;ll bite off more than he can chew,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You can tell by the crowds that you can&rsquo;t put this genie back in the bottle. It&rsquo;s a losing battle.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Morgan also isn&rsquo;t stressed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not overly worried just for the simple fact I feel Nevada has the strongest regulations in the country,&rdquo; Morgan says. &ldquo;I feel like if he were to make an example, I think it would be a different state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As far as consuming marijuana, you still can&rsquo;t light up in public or even hotel rooms, thus many tourists are opting for vape pens and edibles. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve definitely seen a spike in sales of both of those, especially the closer you are to the Strip obviously,&rdquo; says Morgan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But will we see consumption lounges for the pungent flower any time soon? &ldquo;The bill I had died,&rdquo; says Segerblom, &ldquo;but it appears that the local jurisdictions have authority and they can do anything, so it&rsquo;s really going to be up to the City Council and the County Commission to decide whether they want to do it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I think, frankly, the hotels like it, the police like it and the demand to have some kind of lounges or coffee shops or whatever is going to be there, but it&rsquo;s going to take a while.&rdquo; With Segerblom setting his sights on running for the Clark County Commission next, perhaps a cannabis coffee shop isn&rsquo;t too far off in the future.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Public education campaign on adult-use marijuana launches in July</h4>
<p>The organizers of Coalition to Regulate Marijuana like Alcohol or Question 2 have launched a public education campaign at <em>knowthefactsnevada.com</em> to inform Nevadans and tourists about the new recreational marijuana law and regulations that went into effect on July 1.&nbsp; &ldquo;Know the Facts Nevada will work with industry leaders to ensure that these first few months of adult-use marijuana sales roll out smoothly,&rdquo; said Joe Brezny, campaign spokesperson for Know the Facts Nevada. The campaign will run partner with local media to provide information about consuming marijuana safely and responsibly, while highlighting the dos and don&rsquo;ts of the new law.</p>
<h4>Recreational marijuana distribution licenses awarded</h4>
<p>Crooked Wine, a federally licensed liquor distributor based in Reno, who partnered with Blackbird Logistics, the main distributor for Nevada medical marijuana establishments, received the state&rsquo;s first marijuana distribution license. Crooked Wine will hold the license while Blackbird acts as its agent for retail marijuana distribution. A second distribution license was awarded to Las Vegas-based Rebel One.</p>
<h4>NDA launches campaign to educate public about edibles</h4>
<p>The Nevada Dispensary Association (NDA) has launched a new website, <em>goodtoknownv.com</em>, to educate Nevadans and tourists on the state&rsquo;s new recreational marijuana law. &ldquo;We are heeding the advice of Colorado lawmakers and regulators to be proactive about public awareness and education on responsible consumption of marijuana,&rdquo; said NDA Executive Director Riana Durrett.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To aid in the education process, the NDA announced the launch of the &ldquo;Good to Know&rdquo; Nevada information campaign, which seeks to provide useful facts to tourists and Nevadans on subjects ranging from edible safety to youth prevention. Retailers will also find a copy of the written notification (updated as of July 1, 2017) that must be distributed to customers who purchase product.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Objections Overruled: Overcoming Common Cannabis Customer Challenges</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Mark S.A. Smith</h4>
<p>An important aspect of sales acumen focuses on overcoming customer objections. When a customer says &ldquo;no,&rdquo; how do you continue the conversation? When you and your sales team can turn a higher percentage of the &ldquo;no&rsquo;s&rdquo; to &ldquo;yes&rsquo;s&rdquo; you can instantly increase sales and profits, plus you can satisfy the reason for the customer to come into your store.</p>
<p>To routinely overcome objections, you need to understand four things:</p>
<p>1) The customer came in to the store to accomplish a specific outcome. If they leave without accomplishing that outcome, they may never come back. Your job is to make sure they leave satisfied, including overcoming any objections that might arise that prevents them from doing so.</p>
<p>2) Until a salesperson speaks, there are no objections, only unmet customer desires. Objections arise when a salesperson makes a claim the customer finds undesirable. Understand and sell to your customer&rsquo;s wanted outcome and few, if any, objections appear.</p>
<p>3) Most negative responses from customers aren&rsquo;t really objections. Legendary sales trainer Zig Ziglar sagely pointed out, &ldquo;Every sale has five basic obstacles: no need, no money, no hurry, no desire, no trust.&rdquo; Your sales job becomes helping them clarify their need and desire, helping them understand urgency (rarely a problem when selling cannabis), match their budget, and, along the way, create trust.</p>
<p>4) The four steps to overcoming objections: a) Create agreement &ndash; it&rsquo;s easier to move from agreement to agreement than from disagreement to agreement. b) Ask them to consider another option, being open to thinking about a different way to achieve their desired outcome. c) Give them a surprising or delightful insight about the new option that resets&nbsp;their expectations. d) Invite them to try the new option at little or no risk.</p>
<p>With these ideas in mind, consider some responses to common objections, such as: &ldquo;I can get it cheaper somewhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement is routinely used &ndash; whether it&rsquo;s true or not &ndash; to get merchants to lower their price or sweeten the deal. You must brush this off at least once or twice to hold your price. Try these responses:</p>
<p><em>--&ldquo;When you say cheaper, how much cheaper?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>--&ldquo;If prices were all the same, who would you choose?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>--&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always a possibility, yet, I&rsquo;ve found that often there&rsquo;s a reason why it&rsquo;s cheaper, and it&rsquo;s not always a good one. With cannabis, you want the best possible quality, the freshest product, and the highest purity. Don&rsquo;t you? And that doesn&rsquo;t come cheap. What price-point do you have in mind?&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Another common objection is &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have my favorite brand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never knock their favorite. Instead, understand what makes it a favorite and then offer them an upgraded option. I recommend using the phrase &ldquo;upgraded&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;better&rdquo; as it creates less resistance and doesn&rsquo;t feel judgmental about their preference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Oh? What&rsquo;s your favorite brand? Why do you like it? What do you wish it would do? Would you consider trying something very similar and a little upgraded from that?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the easily transcended: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to spend that much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Oh, I understand. There are a few options. If you&rsquo;re celebrating and want something of this quality to treat yourself, then we can go with a smaller quantity. You&rsquo;ll find it goes along way. Under what circumstances would you be willing to spend <br /> that much?</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Make a list of the most common objections you hear. You&rsquo;ll probably find that there aren&rsquo;t that many, you just hear them all the time. Then create responses using these ideas, testing and fine tuning them until you maximize your success helping change your customers&rsquo; minds. And if you want some help, contact me.&nbsp;</p>

		<title>DB Labs Becomes First ISO/IEC 17025:2005 Accredited Lab in Las Vegas</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>DB Labs, a cannabis-testing laboratory, has become the first and only ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accredited marijuana-analysis lab in Las Vegas. Consumers might be asking themselves, so what does that mean for me?</p>
<p>ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation is a standard used by testing and calibration labs, accreditation is required by most countries. Outside of the United States, calibration and test results will not be accepted from unaccredited labs. Within the United States, having the accreditation raises the bar for testing standards and assures customers that their products have been rigorously tested to ensure the safety and health of users. Unaccredited labs would be wise to follow suit, because ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation could become compulsory soon. Currently, one other lab in Nevada has the accreditation &ndash; 374 Labs &ndash; but no others laboratories in Vegas have received a certification.</p>
<p>Susan Bunce, President at DB Labs, says, &ldquo;As the first cannabis-testing laboratory in Nevada, DB Labs has always taken&nbsp; patient safety very seriously and has always tried to raise the bar. Now, being the&nbsp; first lab in Las Vegas to receive the ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation, we are setting the standard and want to set a good example for other labs that can provide this high level of testing for users.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bunce continued, &ldquo;The world of cannabis testing is often compared to the Wild West: each lab uses state regulations to set their own standards, but this leaves a lot of room for subjective interpretations and leniency. The accreditation removes the ambiguity and guarantees a consistent level of testing to users. We are proud to be a part of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Nevada, cannabis labs are required to test for certain contaminates like pesticides, heavy metals, mycotoxins, residual solvent, and microbials. However, these requirements do not list the same rigorous standards the accreditation requires. Bunce stated, &ldquo;Eventually Nevada&rsquo;s new, recreational users will realize that their cannabis contains more than the advertised THC number, and that it could contain harmful molds or other contaminates. There is so much more to cannabis that users need to be aware of, including the potential benefits of different strains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"We at DB Labs are proud to become the first cannabis testing facility in Southern Nevada to accredited to ISO/IEC 17025:2005. It's awesome to see that all the long hours, late nights and months of hard-work are paying off and being recognized," stated Glen Marquez laboratory manager for DB Labs.</p>
<p>DB Labs recommends that patients ask their local bud-tender at a dispensary which strain will offer the best benefits for their needs, such as appetite suppressant or enhancement, antimicrobials, anti-inflammatories, or other alternatives. Those who are new to cannabis use are encouraged to pick up a DB Labs brochure from their local dispensary titled &ldquo;Consumer Guide to Cannabis.&rdquo; DB Labs prepared this brochure to educate users on potential benefits and drawbacks of different strains, as well as potential deleterious ingredients in untested cannabis.</p>
<p>Dr. Ben Chew, the new regional lab manager for DB Labs, joined the team in anticipation of the increased demand for recreational marijuana. &ldquo;I wanted to ensure quality cannabis for users of DB Labs products, because untested or badly tested cannabis can have serious negative effects for users. Although medical patients are more fragile and require more rigorously tested marijuana, DB Labs provides that same level of testing to recreational users, too. DB Labs sought the ISO/IEC 17025:2005 accreditation as a guarantee to our users that our products are the gold standard <br /> in cannabis.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standardization in testing means that users can expect the same level of high from the same amount of product consistently. For those who have felt the overwhelming sensation of consuming too much of an edible, this assurance will be a huge relief. Additionally, for consumers who have ingested cannabis and felt ripped-off by the underwhelming effects of a product that claims to have a high THC number, this standardization will provide comfort that their investment is fair.</p>
<p>Kelly Zaugg, laboratory manager, stated, "now that cannabis cultivators and production facilities, as well as medical marijuana patients have an accredited laboratory to partner with, they can be confident that the results from DB Labs are the most accurate and reliable. We are happy to show our continued commitment in providing high quality service that the community can depend on."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Chew stated, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud to work for a lab that doesn&rsquo;t sell test results. Our clients know that they will receive rigorous testing and results that are accurate. In other states labs have been accused of THC inflation, passing cannabis that is below standard, and other issues: at DB Labs, our accreditation puts users&rsquo; minds at ease, because they know their cannabis is safe.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Drawing from her two decades of professional experience across the pharmaceutical, mental health, non-profit, and cannabis industries, Lezli Engelking founded FOCUS, Foundation of Cannabis Unified Standards. After 12 years with Eli Lilly and as executive director of the first chain of vertically integrated cannabis operations in Arizona, Engelking’s experience in the highly-regulated pharmaceutical industry and the unregulated cannabis industry led her to develop a third-party validated, cannabis specific standards company.

Why did you start FOCUS? </a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">
I could see a lot of the problems with not having a set of standards to follow as a business owner. It’s a hard thing, you come from wherever your background is and you end up with an [MME] license and immediately you are not just a business owner, you are a farmer, a HR manager, a brand marketing director, an accountant, an attorney -- you have got so many different aspects of the responsibilities of the business and it’s really difficult to navigate. In any another industry like pharma or food, there are guidelines to follow and the reason I started FOCUS was because public health and consumer safety are my priorities. I wanted to give businesses some guidance on that.

What challenges did you encounter when trying to start FOCUS? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

When I started talking about standards in early 2014, people were afraid of me. I felt like I had a target on my back all the time. They thought I was trying to push for heavier regulations and inviting government into their business and taking away some of that freedom when it’s exactly the opposite of that. Standards are the way to create sensible regulations and to protect industry. At the end of the day, the consumer or patient is always the highest priority. We want to put something in place that the federal government can use to regulate and it’s a system they are already comfortable using in other industries. We are just here to make sure as this progresses it’s done in a safe manner.

</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I felt like I really wasn’t able to help patients anymore because of some of the different regulations [in pharma]. I wasn’t sure what direction I was going to take. That’s when medical [marijuana] passed in Arizona in 2010 and friends were applying for licenses and they asked me to work on that because of my background in pharma. I worked in public health in Arizona prior to pharma so I had a good feel for the regulatory climate and how it worked. At first, I said no, it literally took them a couple of months to convince me to do it just because I didn’t know anything about cannabis. I didn’t have the background and it is federally illegal. They sort of wore me down with data, I just kept reading all of these medical benefits which you don’t really hear about. If you are not in the space you don’t hear about the medical side or at least not in 2010. Once I started reading about that I thought it would be a real opportunity to help people and get myself back in a space where I felt like I was in pharma and don’t have the ability to be anymore.

How long did it take to formulate the standards for FOCUS? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Standards themselves, if they are voluntary consensus standards like FOCUS’s, are suitable for adoption into regulations through accreditation bodies. Then they are continually updated to reflect the changing needs of the industry. But as far as the core standards we developed, it took about two years. It’s not a fast process. The requirements for developing those standards guidelines are pretty intense, everybody has to have a say, you have to get balanced input from all stakeholder groups. We couldn’t just get a bunch of cannabis industry experts together and say, ‘Hey these should be the standards, let’s self-regulate.’ We had to build a safe legal cannabis industry that works on a global level.

What has been a challenge in formulating accredited industry standards for an illegal industry? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

To develop the standards that we did, we had to use stakeholders from all industry groups. And, at that point it’s 2014, people are still nervous and skeptical. I think the whole attitude toward cannabis has changed dramatically in the last few years so making sure we pulled the right experts in from other industries and do the right thing was a challenge at first. 
Remember, when I set out to do this, I honestly had no idea what the hell I was doing. I don’t have a background in this. I just knew I had a really good basis of knowledge from my years and years in pharma and I knew there was a super big need for it. I did tons of research when I was developing my business plan to look at what existing organizations were out there that might be a good business model to follow.

How many cannabis companies have FOCUS certification? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Right now, none have finished the process but there are 14 companies going through it. If you decide to go through certification with FOCUS or any other party, it can’t happen overnight because it literally addresses every aspect of your business from top to bottom, from HR policies to product specifications. We estimate it takes about six months. We have got a lot of clients working on it. Everything we do is designed to hold hands with the business and make sure we are not just handing them a bunch of standards or a bunch of SOPs. We really want to make sure its integrated into the day-to-day activities of the business. When a state audit is conducted they give you two weeks’ notice and it’s sort of a scramble at the facility to make sure they have all of their documentation and all of their ducks in a row. Our goal is to make sure no matter what, a FOCUS-certified client could be inspected for a drop-in audit and never have a problem.

What’s the most important thing for people to know about FOCUS? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

To me the most important thing in creating a certification body was to remove any implications of impropriety. If I take money from a cannabis company or from a company that is also funding the cannabis industry, that takes away some of the legitimacy of who we are. We have worked really hard to stay independent. Personally, that’s been one of the biggest challenges because I have done this through my own savings and with the help of family and friends. FOCUS is really the health and safety organization for this industry so we want to be able to back up everything we say and do.

What has been one of FOCUS’s most notable achievements in 2017? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

FOCUS was designed to be a collaborative organization. We are not competitive, we always want to work with other people because the best thing for this industry is to have one set of unified standards that people can use as a baseline, which is the reason we are so excited about collaborating with ASTM [American Section of the International Association for Testing Materials], and development of their standards. It’s one of the largest standards development organizations in the world; it predates ISO [International Organization for Standardization] and they recently decided to move into this space and work on cannabis standards. They have asked FOCUS to contribute our standards as the baseline for development of their standards. It truly is a global harmonization effort to bring standards to this industry but also to regulatory bodies around the world so that everybody can work under the same framework.

<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

We are working with a lot of different agencies around the world to bring unity to this. My goal is to see third-party certification as a part of this industry to give regulators the confidence they need. At the end of the day, it’s the patients and consumer who need to be sure they have a safe, consistent quality product and I don’t think we are there yet. Now we are just trying to get out there and get the certification processes happening. We would really like to work with consumer organizations to help drive awareness and the importance of a certified product whether its FOCUS-certified or any other agency.

<div id="collapseTen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Standards, in general, in any industry are the baseline and the international language for trade. They are the reason why our bankcards work in in every bank machine around the world even if it’s in a different county and a different language. There is a reason why import and export can happen. If you look at Canada, Holland, Israel and all these other countries, they are already exporting and importing and creating alignments in other countries. The only way to do that is prove that your product was produced in a manner that was appropriate and was safe and effective and that you have got a recall process in place so that if someone were to go wrong, you could pinpoint the problem and find out why and who was effected by it. I definitely think a globally harmonized standard is the best thing for this industry.

Is setting the standards for the cannabis industry different from other industries?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEleven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Standards in the cannabis industry are all over the place with all the different regulations in different jurisdictions across the U.S. To go into other states, you have to partner with someone and you don’t know what their ethics and values are or what their practices are, so truly standard regulations will make everything so much easier for this industry. It also gives guidance on how to do things. The state regs. regulate who can buy it, who can sell, but they don’t tell you anything about how to make that product safe and that’s kind of the difference in standards.

Do you see this industry as a collection of disruptors to either pharmaceutical companies or the black market? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwelve" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Certainly, this industry is being disruptive. The hope is that if we can regulate it properly it would be disruptive or destructive to the black market. I don’t think we are there yet. As for pharma, we are never going to change the need for pharmaceutical, pharmaceuticals change lives. Cannabis is not going to replace all that but it certainly has a place in the treatment of many many ailments. FOCUS standards are like cannaceuticals in how to make cannabis standards similar to a pharmaceutical standard. But you don’t go and look at pharmaceutical standards to do that because they are not applicable to whole-plant medicine. The FDA can’t see through that whole plant medicine idea. If you look at the nutraceutical industry or dietary supplements they have had so many problems with quality and safety that we really want to put an important framework into place so we don’t have those issues with cannabis as medicine.

What has surprised you the most about cannabis since you became involved in the industry? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThirteen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

The biggest surprise to me was that there were no quality and safety standards like there are in other industries. My background is in compliance and to find out this entire industry exists on a global level as well across the U.S. and there were no quality and safety measures behind it -- that is crazy. That was the reason for starting FOCUS. How is it that something that is called medicine, that people are using who have compromised immune systems, does not have any of the controls for quality and safety in place and still be called a medicine? FOCUS standards aren’t for medical only. In my mind, you need one standard. We don’t want people who are using cannabis recreationally to turn into patients because their immune system is compromised because of tainted cannabis. It’s for everyone but, certainly, on a medical level that’s an even more important factor.

<div class="panel-body">

Getting this industry to think about standards in the first place. When I started this people were so afraid of me, they thought I was trying to overregulate them. So, I had to step back and say clearly there is some education needed here. So, I quit talking about FOCUS for a year-and-a-half and started talking about the difference between standards, regulations, laws and what standard-based regulation looks like, and why that’s important to an industry. I certainly wouldn’t take credit for it all happening because of me. The development and growth in the industry and all the problems we have seen with the recalls has definitely expedited that understanding and created a demand and need for it but I think that’s probably the biggest thing I have been able to contribute, changing some thinking around that. We are here to talk about health and safety. We are in a really good position to change some of that dialogue and education is the key to doing that.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span >For this Grow Op Overview, Grower&rsquo;s Network heads to Nevada to speak with Tryke CEO Matthew Morgan and Darren Carpenter, Director of Cultivation, for </span><a href="http://trykecompanies.com/"><span >Tryke Companies</span></a><span >, the holding company doing business as </span><a href="http://reefdispensaries.com/"><span >Reef Dispensaries</span></a><span >, which has three dispensary locations in the Silver State. </span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Tryke is the holding company for Reef Dispensaries, our trade name,&rdquo; explains Morgan of the &nbsp;&nbsp;three different Tryke companies, each located in a specific geographic location: Arizona, Southern Nevada, and Northern Nevada. &ldquo;The same executive operating team runs all three companies, and each Tryke does business as Reef Dispensaries. We currently have 10 office directors and 250+ employees spread over the three entities.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span >Tryke is currently operating about 100,000 square feet of cultivation space between Arizona and Nevada, with the potential to grow another half million square feet based on demand.</span><span ><br /></span><span >&ldquo;Tryke originally started in Phoenix, Arizona but we wanted to be financially stable,&rdquo; says Morgan. &ldquo;When we saw that there was a good chance to go recreational in Nevada, we found a building close to the Strip where we could have a flagship indoor cultivation.&rdquo;</span><span ><br /></span><span >Of their choice to go with an indoor cultivation, Carpenter explains, &ldquo;Our operations are designed for indoor cultivation, because of location and regulations. In the Southwest, we have cooling issues to deal with. If we built a greenhouse in the middle of Phoenix, the costs would be as much as an indoor grow.&rdquo; </span></p>
<h3><strong>The Plants</strong></h3><span >Reef&rsquo;s two</span><span > facilities combined are growing about 30,000 different plants. &ldquo;Our genetics lockers have about 200 strains, but we are currently growing about 50-60 strains. Our strains are selected based on supply and demand with an extra rotation to keep our retails fresh with new inventory so that our patients don&rsquo;t get bored of the same flavor,&rdquo; offers Carpenter. </span>
<p><span >Reef has a building management system that runs automatic nutrient dosing and automatic feeding systems in addition to environment controls. &ldquo;It was custom designed for us by a controlled environment engineer,&rdquo; offers Morgan. </span></p>
<p><span >Supplying details, Carpenter says, &ldquo;We use a top-down, drip-fed, drain-to-waste system. We grow with Coco Coir and Grodan rockwool. We make our own nutrients. While the mixture is proprietary, we keep it fairly basic. The mother plants are treated more delicately, so they get a different feeding regimen. We use a preventative IPM strategy that allows us to pass state requirements. Every room gets looked at every day. I can&rsquo;t disclose too much more because it is one of our competitive edges.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Carpenter estimates that about 10 percent of their facility is propagation, and another 15 percent is for veg, and the flowering rooms are about 75 percent of each facility. &ldquo;We follow the industry standard: T5 bulbs for propagation, metal halide lights for veg, and HPS DE for flowering. HPS in veg also works well. We use a custom paint spec for higher reflectivity,&rdquo; reveals Carpenter. </span></p>
<h2><strong>INDUSTRY CHALLENGES</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>MJ Freeway and the Repercussions</strong></h3><span >Morgan: We lost seven figures in revenue because of the MJ Freeway fiasco. People were working 18-hour days to move us over to a whole new platform, but we had no choice. Now we&rsquo;re using</span> <span >a hybrid system of </span><a href="https://www.biotrack.com/"><span >BioTrackTHC</span></a><span > and Microsoft accounting software for midsized companies. </span>
<h3><strong>Trump Administration </strong></h3>
<p><span >Morgan: What&rsquo;s going on in the White House is really making it difficult to plan our future moves. Our business model requires a thriving recreational market in Nevada, and we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happening with the current administration.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Growth</strong></h3>
<p><span >Morgan: Tryke is our biggest success. We&rsquo;ve grown from one person to over 250 employees. We&rsquo;re in great shape for our third anniversary.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Sunshine State </strong></h3>
<p><span >Morgan</span><strong>: </strong><span >Our biggest regret is not lobbying harder in Florida. We had high hopes and they were dashed by their regulations. Put it this way: A cannabis company cannot succeed under Florida regulations. Everybody there is hemorrhaging money. They&rsquo;re receiving a ton of public backlash right now. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Richard S. Gubbe</h4>

<p><span >Kyle Turley is all too familiar with the stigmas attached to smoking marijuana. Clawing his way into pro football was accomplished without ever smoking a joint. On his way to becoming NFL All-Pro, he embraced cannabis as a way to relieve the pain that came from all the clawing. While he is still very much an advocate and partaker of cannabis, Turley says he has discovered a cure for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative disease suffered from repeated blows to the head, without using cannabis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Despite advancements in medical marijuana, Turley has circumvented the stigmas that accompany cannabis by creating cannabidiol- or CBD-driven products from hemp. &ldquo;I knew cannabis was medicinal the first time I smoked it,&rdquo; Turley told </span><em><span >elevate</span></em><span >. Along the way he learned about CBD and the entourage effect. But medical cannabis isn&rsquo;t legal everywhere and using a psychoactive drug isn&rsquo;t well received by NFL hierarchy. The same ingredients are found in hemp and hemp has a more respectable reputation with its many legal uses.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;CTE is why I&rsquo;m doing this and I can&rsquo;t deny what CBD has done for me,&rdquo; Turley said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been my mission.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >A year and a half in the making, Turley put his cannabis knowledge to work firsthand and helped create hemp-rich Neuro Armour products. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve gotten so many of my friends off of pharmaceuticals -- guys I played football with who were in a lot of pain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They all deal with suicidal tendencies and rage. When you have grown men, who thought they were bulletproof, calling you in the middle of the night and you have to talk them off the ledge, I had to do something more. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m doing this.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Not until recently did the truth come to light about what price players pay. While an NFL vet lives longer than the average male in this country, their lives are often a torture chamber from the effects of the concussive blows they have absorbed. They go from physical torture to pharmaceutical torture to, often, suicidal endings. A survey of findings published in the </span><em><span >Journal of the American Medical Association</span></em><span > in July found that 110 of 111 brains of NFL players studied posthumously suffered from CTE. That&rsquo;s just one of the tortuous and demeaning fates that await such mental anguish, there&rsquo;s also PTSD and dementia. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >While bonding with teammates, Turley learned of the underground network that could supply players pot in the different cities they played in to combat pain. &ldquo;When I was in college, I didn&rsquo;t want to risk it,&rdquo; Turley recalled. &ldquo;In my second year in the NFL at age 23, I had my first experience with cannabis. When I was playing in all those cities, every now and then something would come along through the pipeline.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >The AMA&rsquo;s recent finding of CTE in 99 percent of brains tested from deceased players has sparked even more interest in the use of natural products such as THC and CBD in the NFL. ESPN reported recently that a letter from the NFL to the National Football League Players Association offered to work together on a study to find ways to combat chronic pain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Turley says researchers at Neuro Armour have found huge benefits by removing any trace of THC and reintroducing the plant&rsquo;s natural terpenes and other valuable cannabinoids.</span></p>
<p><span >Whether it&rsquo;s hemp or cannabis, Turley wants to bring what he says is a cure for CTE to anyone who has had a concussion, and as a preventative, using liquid CBD. To outsmart the naysayers who will never accept cannabis, he uses the same ingredients but they are derived from a blend of proprietary terpenes he formulated.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Terpenes are definitely a factor but CBD is the key along with rapid absorption,&rdquo; Turley said. &ldquo;We have a 50-state legal opportunity and we have to get this to the people.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Turley, while keeping his proprietary secrets, did reveal to </span><em><span >elevate</span></em><span > that he uses whole strains of hemp that fit the profile he is seeking before adding his preferred ingredients of more terpenes to accompany the full-spectrum CBD in his various mixtures.</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;If people could understand that even with hemp we can solve this,&rdquo; he expounded. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t leave out the entourage effect. We use full-spectrum CBD and keep the strain the same.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Neuro Armour products include a sublingual tincture, concentrated MCT oil, a vape product that uses a syringe for cartridge fills, and CBD capsules. Neuro Armour uses no food flavorings. Soon to follow will be a skin product, dab wax for asthma patients, and bottled water.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Neuro Armour CBD is lab-tested and 100 percent THC-free. CBD has been shown in studies to have neuro-protective and antioxidative properties. Turley thinks it will help anyone suffering from chronic pain and adds that it&rsquo;s never too early for prevention. Prevention for Turley means guarding a child&rsquo;s brain from any early trauma.</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;We can potentially stop this disease [CTE] from happening by introducing CBD to our kids as a form of prevention,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
<p><span >He also wants to tackle Alzheimer&rsquo;s. &ldquo;There is nothing in western medicine that deals with Alzheimer&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Studies have shown CBD can stop the progression </span><span ><br /></span><span >of the disease.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Turley played eight seasons in the NFL, selected 7th overall in the &rsquo;98 draft by the Saints&rsquo; Mike Ditka. He was All-Pro in 2000 was invited to the 2001 Pro Bowl.</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Kyle Turley is a great kid,&rdquo; said Ditka, who serves on the board of Gridiron Greats Foundation with him. &ldquo;He always has his heart in the right place and looks out for his brothers. If it&rsquo;s legal and it helps people? We are all in.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >&nbsp;&ldquo;CBD has played an important role in allowing me to personally manage pain, cope with CTE-like symptoms, improve my overall health and eliminate the need for prescription opioids that nearly cost me my life due to long-term use side effects,&rdquo; Turley said, who played five seasons for the Saints and a year with the Rams before a serious back injury sidelined him in 2004 and 2005. He returned for two years with the Chiefs, retiring in 2007.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;If we can allow players and veterans to recover naturally with proper dietary and organic therapies, we should be doing so. Our communities have suffered needlessly with the inherent risks in accomplishing greatness.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Turley relates the story of how his CTE and chronic pain was so bad he couldn&rsquo;t be around electrical lighting of any kind. He was visiting California dispensaries up and down the state collecting and sampling cannabis profiles &ldquo;then I hit it &ndash; Jack Herer,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lighting stopped hurting my eyes. I&rsquo;ll never forget it. I was standing under a big chandelier and the lights were really bright and I was talking to my wife and I found myself staring into the lights saying, &lsquo;look, I can stare into the light.&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Turley looks tremendously fit and pronounced himself cured. He walks with ease and says he has no mental issues. &ldquo;Jack Herer is the best psych medication,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to bottle it up and take it to every doctor and say &lsquo;beat that.&rsquo; You can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Neuro Armour products are available at Shango dispensaries. Proceeds from sales go toward Ditka&rsquo;s Gridiron Greats Foundation. The partnership perpetually commits significant proceeds from Neuro Armour product sales and will include donated product exclusively implemented in programs and studies facilitated by Gridiron Greats and the After The Impact Fund, which serves military veterans, former NFL players and their families by facilitating neurocognitive and behavioral treatment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >&nbsp;&ldquo;We now have the NFL&rsquo;s support and not from what I&rsquo;ve said but from what they have seen. It&rsquo;s the biggest thing to happen to healthcare since cannabis became part of the discussion. If the NFL follows through and they hold to the research and the media holds them to it, medical marijuana and CBD can change healthcare in America,&rdquo; Turley explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got hope again.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>By Derek J. Connor, Esq </h3>
<p><span >A significant portion of my law practice is dedicated to providing clients with legal advice regarding Nevada&rsquo;s complex marijuana laws and regulations. One issue that frequently comes up involves the relationship between marijuana, firearms, and the Second Amendment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Our right to possess firearms is protected by the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which states: </span><em><span >A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p><span >A mere 27 words long, this simple sentence has perhaps caused more controversy than any other in the entirety of constitutional jurisprudence. No matter where you fall in the firearms debate, the U.S. Supreme Court recently held that the Second Amendment does in fact guarantee the constitutional right of the individual to keep and bear arms, unconnected with service in the militia [see, </span><em><span >District of Colombia v. Heller</span></em><span >, 554 U.S. 570 (2008)]. Shortly thereafter, the court held that the individual right to bear arms is incorporated by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment and applies to the states [561 U.S. 742 (2010)]. Since </span><em><span >Heller</span></em><span > and its related cases, the Supreme Court has been relatively reluctant to take on new cases challenging local firearm laws, denying writs of certiorari in several cases.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>he Federal Prohibition of Marijuana&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span >While several states have relaxed their marijuana laws in recent years, federal law remains entrenched. Marijuana patients, business owners and recreational users must understand that pursuant to federal law it is illegal to cultivate, possess or distribute marijuana. The federal government does not recognize the medical use of marijuana nor does it recognize state laws legalizing recreational marijuana which are in direct contradiction of federal prohibition. Given that federal law trumps state law pursuant to the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, federal authorities are under no obligation to recognize a medical marijuana patient card or any other state issued certification allowing the bearer to possess, distribute, or produce marijuana.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Firearms and Marijuana under Federal Law</strong></p>
<p><span >It is uncontestable that 18 U.S.C &sect; 922(g)(3) prohibits any person who is an &ldquo;unlawful user of or addicted to&rdquo; any controlled substance as defined by section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802) from possessing firearms or ammunition. Quite simply, under federal law, marijuana users are not allowed to own or possess firearms or ammunition. Legally speaking, we need go no further than this. An attorney should advise their clients that they are federally prohibited from owning, transporting, or possessing firearms if they are a marijuana user, whether they have a state issued patient card or if they are in a state where marijuana has been legalized for adult use. Irrespective of the federal prohibition, some individuals are quite undeterred and will continue to use marijuana and firearms no matter what their government tells them.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Department of Justice Policy regarding Firearms </strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>and Marijuana&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span >In a letter to federal firearms licensees, Arthur Herbert of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) elaborated the Department&rsquo;s position on medical marijuana patients and firearms in an open letter to all federal firearms licensees in 2011 available at www.nssf.org/share/PDF/ATFOpenLetter092111.pdf and [hereinafter &ldquo;Open Letter&rdquo;]. In a nutshell, the DOJ does not believe medical marijuana users are allowed to possess firearms or ammunition, nor does it permit federal firearms licensees to sell firearms or ammunition to known medical marijuana users. While the 2011 Open Letter speaks mainly to medical marijuana users, it follows that the same logic will be applied to recreational marijuana users as the federal restriction applies to each.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Plaintiffs seeking to challenge the federal restriction on marijuana users have met with little success. In </span><em><span >Wilson v. Holder</span></em><span >, Judge Gloria Navarro of the Nevada District Court granted the government&rsquo;s motion to dismiss a challenge to the federal restriction on firearm ownership by a Nevada medical marijuana patient. Also, </span><em><span >United States v. Dugan</span></em><span > held that 18 U.S.C &sect; 922(g)(3) did not violate the defendant&rsquo;s right to bear arms under the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Thus, until we have a change in the status of marijuana at a federal level, it appears unlikely that firearm owners who use marijuana will find relief in the federal court system.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Purchasing Firearms as a Marijuana User&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span >Nevada recently mandated background checks for all firearm transfers in the state of Nevada, although enforcement has been delayed under the current Nevada Attorney General. When purchasing a firearm over the counter from a federally licensed dealer, buyers are required to fill out ATF Form 4473. Question &ldquo;11(e)&rdquo; of Form 4473 asks buyers whether they are &ldquo;an unlawful user of, or addicted to, marijuana or any depressant, stimulant, narcotic drug, or any other controlled substance.&rdquo; The form was updated to include the following language: &ldquo;Warning: The use or possession of marijuana remains unlawful under Federal law regardless of whether it has been legalized or decriminalized for medicinal or recreational purposes in the state where you reside.&rdquo; As stated in the Open Letter, the DOJ believes that patients must answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the question and that failing to do so could result in a perjury conviction. Consequently, patients and recreational users who answer &ldquo;no&rdquo; to question 11e are taking a serious risk.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Federal Sentencing Enhancements</strong></p>
<p><span >The penalties under federal law for crimes involving firearms and marijuana can be very severe. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &sect; 924(c), if you are found to be in possession of a firearm during the commission of a drug trafficking offense, the mandatory minimum penalty for a basic offense is five years; if the firearm is a short-barreled shotgun or a semi-auto &ldquo;assault weapon,&rdquo; the penalty is ten years; if the firearm is equipped with a suppressor, the sentence is 30 years. In addition to the above, convictions of felony marijuana violations could result in the loss of voting rights and prohibition of future firearm ownership among others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >As a practical matter, most patients and recreational users are unlikely to come under federal scrutiny for marijuana possession. The federal authorities simply do not have the budget or the inclination to pursue low-level marijuana users. However, in a large western state like Nevada, where much of the land is held by the federal government, patients and recreational users are more likely to have interactions with federal law enforcement officers than in other states.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Marijuana and Firearms under Nevada State Law</strong></p>
<p><span >Surprisingly, Nevada state law is relatively silent on the issue of marijuana use and firearms. There is nothing in Nevada state law that would expressly prohibit a medical marijuana patient from owning or possessing a firearm. However, NRS 202.360, prohibits the ownership or possession of firearms by certain prohibited persons including convicted felons, fugitives from justice, or persons who are an unlawful user of, or addicted to, any controlled substance. Marijuana patients have relied on this language to argue that they are not &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; users of marijuana under state law and should therefore be permitted to possess firearms under Nevada state law. It follows that recreational users should be given the same protection as their use of marijuana is no longer prohibited.</span></p>

<p><strong>Use of a Firearm by an Intoxicated Person</strong></p>
<p><span >It is basic gun safety that you should never be under the influence of any intoxicating substance while using a firearm. While it does not mention marijuana specifically, NRS 202.257 prohibits persons from being in &ldquo;actual physical possession&rdquo; of a firearm while under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances to such a degree that would render them incapable of safely exercising control of the firearm. Notably, the statute does not prohibit &ldquo;the actual physical possession of a firearm by a person who was within their personal residence and had the firearm in his or her possession solely for self-defense.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Concealed Carry Permits and Medical Marijuana Patients</strong></p>
<p><span >The most common query that comes up more than any other is: Can I get a concealed carry permit if I am a marijuana patient? Pursuant to NRS 202.3657, Nevada residents and non-residents may apply to the county sheriff for a permit to carry a concealed weapon. Nevada is what is commonly referred to as a &ldquo;shall issue&rdquo; state, meaning that once a person has demonstrated that they are otherwise qualified under the law, the sheriff must issue them a license to carry a concealed firearm. However, the sheriff must deny an application if it is demonstrated that the applicant has within the preceding five years &ldquo;habitually used intoxicating liquor or a controlled substance to the extent that his or her normal faculties are impaired.&rdquo; See, NRS 202.3657(4)(d). It is presumed that a person has so used intoxicating liquor or substances if during the preceding five years, the person has been convicted of driving under the influence or submitted to civil protective custody. Therefore, people whose faculties are not impaired should qualify for a concealed carry permit so long as they are not otherwise precluded. However, some marijuana patients have reported that local sheriffs have denied their concealed carry applications with the sheriffs arguing that the patients are &ldquo;prohibited persons&rdquo; under Nevada state law and due to the federal prohibition&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >of marijuana. Some counties (including Clark County) have even updated its conceal carry application forms to expressly state that marijuana patients do not qualify for conceal carry permits. The county does not provide their reasoning and it remains to be seen if such a denial would survive a legal challenge. It is also unclear how the sheriffs would have determined that the applicants have patient cards as the list of patients is supposed to be strictly confidential. Because there is no such list of recreational users, it is unlikely that recreational users would be flagged on a background check for a concealed carry permit. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Pursuant to federal law, marijuana users may not own or possess firearms or ammunition. Federal prohibition notwithstanding, because marijuana use is legal in Nevada, users cannot be considered &ldquo;unlawful&rdquo; under state law and should therefore be permitted to possess firearms without the fear of prosecution by state authorities. Although there have been many positive steps towards cannabis legalization in recent years, until there is a change in the scheduling of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act, users who choose to possess firearms will continue to face legal risks and uncertainties. &nbsp;</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span >Go big or go home. That sums up the business philosophy of the Las Vegas Paiute Tribe. By the end of the month the Southern Paiutes will be opening the doors of their 15,800-square-foot dispensary, Nuwu Cannabis Marketplace, which will house 10,000 square feet of retail space. Located in their tribal colony in Downtown Las Vegas at 1253 Paiute Circle, the dispensary will be one of the largest in the United States.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Las Vegas Paiute chairman Benny Tso says that&rsquo;s the way he and fellow tribal members pursue their business ventures, which include the two largest smoke shops in Las Vegas, and three Pete Dye-designed golf courses as well as a 50,000-square-foot clubhouse at the tribe&rsquo;s golf resort on their Snow Mountain Reservation. &ldquo;With this venture, why not keep that mantra going? If we are going to do it, we are just going to go big.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Tso says this philosophy is a result of trying to increase the tribe&rsquo;s footprint. &ldquo;Our Southern Paiute people laid claim to Southern Utah, Northern Arizona, Southern Nevada and Southern California &ndash; this was all Southern Paiute country and over time that has slowly but surely been taken from us. That&rsquo;s the whole idea of why we do things. Go big. We left a footprint here in the beginning and we definitely want to leave a footprint going forward for the future.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Leaving that financial footprint has not been without its challenges. One of the biggest was getting buy-in from the rest of the tribe, which numbers 56 members. &ldquo;The hardest part is educating our tribal membership because of the stigma that cannabis has and going through the process of talking to my relatives and everybody on this council talking to their relatives about this medicine,&rdquo; says Tso.</span></p>
<p><span >That might seem at odds with Native American culture but cannabis has never been significant to the Southern Paiute people. &ldquo;We had to teach our membership and our elders about cannabinoids and terpenes and that everything about this plant has a healing nature. Everybody knows about the THC part of it but they don&rsquo;t understand or know about the other makeup of the cannabis plant. Our Creator put things like those medicinal plants here for us to use. Upon research and learning about it, every human being, each two legs that walks this earth, is embedded with cannabinoid receptors so this is where the natural part comes for us, collecting the herbs. We had to reeducate ourselves about it. The whole education process was the hardest part for us.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >The opportunity to get involved with cannabis came at a fortuitous time for the Paiutes. &ldquo;There is a lot of weight on our shoulders now because of things going on with federal legislation, federal grant dollars are starting to fall by the wayside and so this is our way to make our tribe fully self-sufficient. We were once taught opportunities don&rsquo;t go away, they just knock on other people&rsquo;s doors, and if you are not there to open it up when they knock, then you just miss it. We decided that this was a chance of risk vs. reward and I think this risk we took was well worth the reward for our tribe,&rdquo; explains Tso.</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;That footprint that our ancestors created for us like the smoke shop and golf resort, they left that footprint for us so it&rsquo;s up to this Council to create more footprints with that,&rdquo; Tso concludes of the dispensary. &ldquo;We are creating that footprint to lead our tribe into the future and better our tribe as a whole.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>By Danny Axelrod </h3>
<p><span >Las Vegas is currently abuzz with the possibilities associated with legal marijuana. It&rsquo;s like it was the Summer of Weed, with dispensaries flowing and the entrepreneurial energy palpable. One company, Cannabis Tours, gave people a chance to come together for group sessions and walk away with self-made masterpieces. Their weekend Puff, Pass &amp; Paint/Pottery/Pastry classes allowed guests to bring their own pot and get high while taking a lesson in how to create.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >The link between marijuana and creativity can be traced back centuries. Recently, ancient cannabis scholars have unearthed a tome of a 5th-century BC Chinese philosopher by the name of Stone Tzu. Entitled </span><em><span >The Art of Weed</span></em><span >, this relatively unknown treatise explores the link between getting high and high art. As I explore these classes, I turn to the wisdom of this timeless work to guide me on my quest for creativity. I also turn to my friends at The+Source Dispensary for some pre-rolled indica strains to get me super stoned.</span></p>

<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Creation is a journey the artist makes alone, but that does not mean he should be isolated.&rdquo; ~Stone Tzu</em></strong></p>

<p><span >My journey begins with a Lyft ride to a nondescript residential neighborhood on the southside of town. They say there are no accidents in life, definitely with ridesharing, and I am immediately greeted with the pungent skunky scent of high grade weed the moment I sit down in the back seat. The drive across town is serene and uneventful as I make small talk and explain what I am up to. The driver is very interested in the Puff, Pass &amp; Paint program, and I mention his car smelled like he may have already attended a class or two.</span></p>
<p><span >I arrive at a typical stucco-covered Vegas domicile and I am greeted at the door by a very amicable guy named Mike. The front area of the house is open and tiled with several long tables covered to allow for artistic mess making. He has me sign a waiver explaining that I understand that they are simply an artistic organization and not a licensed dispensary. It also has me affirm that I am just a weed-puffing individual with no intent to sell anything to anybody during our time together. I am on board with all that, so I sign and take a seat at a table of young people ready to fire up their imaginations.</span></p>
<p><span >I mean, literally. No sooner do I sit down than a handmade pipe is passed my way. I do accept it, but I draw lightly, knowing that this is going to be an hours-long experience and I need to remember it well enough afterward. From the very beginning, these classes are designed to bring like-minded strangers and groups of friends together for a shared experience. I have come alone, but the ladies at my table are co-workers enjoying an alternative girls&rsquo; night out. At another table are a mother and daughter enjoying making art together. Another young couple just heard about it on Facebook and decided to give it a try. Master Stone Tzu&rsquo;s words ring true as I consider the important connection between creativity and community.</span></p>

<p><strong><em>&ldquo;The supreme art of weed is to subdue one&rsquo;s intentions and let creation guide one&rsquo;s spirit. Let the art encourage the hands as to how it would like to emerge. The uncarved block always echoes yes.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p><span >After everyone has had a moment to get good and baked, Mike and his associate Kristal begin the class by distributing clay and water and shaping tools. Since it&rsquo;s a Friday night, the class is pottery, with Saturday&rsquo;s devoted to painting and Sunday brunch focused on cooking. I&rsquo;m not sure what was passed around earlier, but all of a sudden I am very into shaping the clay with my hands. I dip my fingers in a cup of water and slowly caress the, as yet, unformed block. The girl next to me is making&hellip;big surprise&hellip;a pipe. She&rsquo;s not the only one, and I decide that I need to find my own way with the clay. But where&hellip;?</span></p>

<p><strong><em>&ldquo;In the midst of chaos, there is also opportunity.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p><span >That&rsquo;s actually a quote from another ancient philosopher, Sun Tzu, but it just fits with what happens next. I hear a noise at my feet and look down to see a small pig grunting and sniffing under the table. Her name is Kaos and she is giving me the once over with deep, soulful eyes. I think of my daughter and her love of animals and use my phone to send her a video. At that moment, the pig&rsquo;s eyes tell me all I need to know and I set about making my piece.</span></p>

<p><strong><em>&ldquo;If you know the canvas and know yourself, you need not fear the result of either a hundred efforts or a single one.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p><span >I separate my clay out into strips and roll it as if I was making pasta noodles. I then lay out a flat strip and start stacking my layers in hoops one on top of the other. I am creating something that, at best, resembles a chopped off beehive, and at worst, might end up looking like a pile of poop. The important thing is that I feel like I know what I am doing. I light up the SFV OG pre-roll from Remedy (Kristal informs me that the &ldquo;SFV&rdquo; stands for San Fernando Valley), take a puff and pass it around as I set to making a jewelry box for my little girl. Mike and Kristal are very encouraging to all the aspiring artists. Like the best instructors, they give pointers but let the participants make their own choices. I really like them as people. I am extremely high. They don&rsquo;t mess around in the SFV.</span></p>

<p><strong><em>&ldquo;One feeds the body as the smoke feeds the mind and the hands feed the creation. The art of weed is best achieved on a satisfied belly.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p><span >Munchies! They are coming on strong and there is a cornucopia of stoner snacks to satiate. There&rsquo;s also plenty of beverages, including beer and box wine. My tablemates brought their own and are mixing Washington Apple cocktails with whisky and apple liqueur. Typically, I don&rsquo;t think mixing strong weed and hard alcohol is a wise idea, but what the heck, I&rsquo;m taking a Lyft home. Cheers!</span></p>
<p><span >As my piece takes shape I listen to Mike&rsquo;s repetitive suggestion to just keep adding water and smoothing it out. I look around and see that at least two other people are doing more or less the same thing as I am! I begin to get a little peeved, but instead light up the Ultimate Chemdawg91 from Remedy. It&rsquo;s a deep, dark indica that brings the whole pace of the room down as the group achieves new levels in stoniness. Who cares if we shared a good idea?</span></p>

<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Appear high when you are low, and slow when you are high. This is the way of the weed.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p><span >As the class wraps up, Mike and Kristal share with us how we can pick up our pieces in a couple of weeks and how all are welcome to try the other classes. They also share how smart it is to call an Uber or taxi to get home, which I am pleased to see everyone thought ahead. It takes a while to get everyone loaded up safe and on their way, and as I am the last one to bid my hosts and their pig farewell, a final quote from Stone Tzu crosses my crisscrossed mind.</span></p>

<p><strong><em>&ldquo;The art of weed is applicable to all endeavors. It permeates the senses as sounds, sights, smells, and tastes are joyously fashioned.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p><span >&nbsp;It is the art of life, well-lived.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span >Hugh Hempel opens his 2015 Ted Talk at the University of Nevada, Reno asking the audience what they would think if he told them his 11-year-old twins were using marijuana? After a pause, he continues, asking how is it possible for 11-year-olds to even get access to pot?</span></p>
<p><span >Hempel goes on to reveal to a rapt audience in an auditorium where you could hear a pin drop that up until two years ago, he was completely ignorant about marijuana. All of that changed after 2007 when his twins Addison and Cassidy, 13, were diagnosed, at almost four years old, with a fatal disease called Niemann-Pick disease type c, a rare progressive genetic disorder characterized by an inability of the body to transport cholesterol and other fatty substances (lipids) inside of cells, and often referred to as childhood Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</span></p>
<p><span >With the rare diagnosis Hempel, 59, and his wife Chris, 48, began a &ldquo;medical odyssey.&rdquo; &ldquo;Many families go through years of trying to get a diagnosis and it could be eight or 10 years before they find out what is wrong with their kids. It took us about 18 months with us being really diligent with medical professionals and trying to get to the bottom of it,&rdquo; says Chris of the twin&rsquo;s Niemann-Pick diagnosis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >A byproduct of Niemann-Pick disease is seizures, which is where cannabis enters the Hempels&rsquo; medical odyssey -- and where the couple &ldquo;go from propagandized by the war on drugs to being advocates almost overnight,&rdquo; explains Hugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Our main focus since our kids were diagnosed was just looking for anything that was available that we could actually give them,&rdquo; says Chris. &ldquo;Prior to getting involved in cannabis, we spent five or six years developing another drug for our twins that then went through the FDA process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;The twins were the first in the world to get a compound called Cyclodextrin. So Hugh and I had already been focused on finding any available option for our twins; whether it be having to make a drug ourselves, which we did with top doctors going more the pharmaceutical route, all the way down to natural types of therapies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;For us it was not really an issue to pursue cannabis, there was enough research on it and its anti-inflammatory effects. If your kids are facing debilitating seizures you will just about try anything, so to us it really wasn&rsquo;t a difficult decision to make.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Hugh adds, &ldquo;We had spent six-plus years reading research journals, understanding medicine and biology so we had a big leg up when it came to finding the research that was available on cannabis.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >The Hempels were alerted to the medical attributes of cannabidiol (CBD), which is a non-psychoactive cannabis compound with medical benefits, after seeing Dr. Sanjay Gupta&rsquo;s 2013 &ldquo;Weed&rdquo; documentary. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we were contending with with the twins,&rdquo; explains Chris of seeing one of the documentary&rsquo;s main storylines, Charlotte Figi, take Charlotte&rsquo;s Web, a CBD-dominant cannabis oil, to combat her seizures resulting from Dravet&rsquo;s Syndrome. &ldquo;They were having very severe seizures from grand mal, tonic-clonic, petit mal, and we were having a lot of trouble controlling those seizures with standard pharmaceutical medications,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Chris compares Addison and Cassidy&rsquo;s seizures to a natural phenomenon. &ldquo;We relate seizures to earthquakes, so if you are in an earthquake zone and, obviously, with two kids having seizures every day, you are racing over to deal with one, and then deal with another seizure, it kind of makes the magnitude of the seizure like an earthquake, maybe a 4.0 versus a 2.0.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Addison and Cassidy were fortunate to experience results from CBD oil &ldquo;pretty quickly. It was within days, more or less -- either you see results or you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; relays Hugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Chris continues, &ldquo;Some people have had really stunning results where CBD has stopped the seizures altogether, but for us it was more of a dampening down of the seizures. You might still have the seizure, but you see some of the intensity decreasing.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Hugh expounds on the earthquake metaphor, adding that &ldquo;the Richter scale factor played in. They had fewer seizures, the seizures were less aggressive and we were able to remove some amount of the zombie cocktail which made them brighter-eyed and gave them a better quality of life. In our twin&rsquo;s case, because they are not Dravet&rsquo;s kids or kids who are seizing 40 or 50 times a day uncontrollably, the results weren&rsquo;t as dramatic, but even subtle results are hugely important.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Hugh&rsquo;s reference to the zombie cocktail is a mix of pharmaceuticals the twins were taking for their seizures and another important consideration regarding cannabis&rsquo; effect. &ldquo;The zombie cocktail thing, don&rsquo;t underestimate that either. The zombie cocktail made them sleepy and groggy, listless, they didn&rsquo;t have fire in their eyes or turn their heads when you walked in the room. There&rsquo;s just a lot of things that became better as a result,&rdquo; he says of the cannabis oil Cassidy and Addison take, which is a combination of CBD and THC administered at a dose of 35 milligrams twice a day.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >For many parents giving a child cannabis is a nerve-wracking proposition, but the Hempels were more fearful about making their daughters&rsquo; cannabis use public than actually giving it to them. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s scary,&rdquo; offers Chris. &ldquo;You heard horror stories in some of the other states where parents were getting arrested and CPS was getting involved. But we felt we needed to stand up and be public about it. The more momentum that was generated, the more people were willing to try it.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;But let&rsquo;s not forget,&rdquo; Hugh interjects, &ldquo;we have only been at it for four or five years, there are people who have been at it double or quadruple that amount of time. It felt very scary for us to come out of the green closet even five years ago and now look at the rate at which people are potentially jumping on board and taking a stand.</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Ironically, the place where we find the most pushback in some way is the traditionally trained Western medicine types. I think they find it either threatening or on whole, because it&rsquo;s more complex, something they don&rsquo;t know about. It&rsquo;s the fear of the unknown and clearly there is some amount of displacement going on, frequently people are using cannabis instead of Western medicine.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Almost simultaneously to their girls starting to take cannabis, the Hempels considered becoming a part of the very industry that would offer their daughters&rsquo; relief. &ldquo;When Sanjay Gupta did that documentary it fit exactly our scenario and that&rsquo;s about the time we started seriously considering not only CBD for the kids, but also becoming part of the industry. It just happened to coincide with when they started talking about the licensing and making it formal here in Nevada,&rdquo; says Hugh of the couple&rsquo;s idea to set up a relatively small-scale grow and dispensary in Reno in the fall of 2013.</span></p>
<p><span >Chris and Hugh became interested in the idea of entering the cannabis industry when they &ldquo;quickly realized there was no professionalism in the creation of the medicine and we thought we were well suited to go there because of our background with technology and medicine and NIH (National Institutes of Health). And, just generally speaking, being business professionals we saw an opportunity to do good for society. That&rsquo;s a lot of what started it all and at the same time, perhaps, do well financially for ourselves and our investors.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >One of the professional considerations the Hempels wanted to bring to the industry included cannabis that was medical grade quality. &ldquo;A lot of the products are not tested for pesticides, molds and microbials. When you are dealing with kids who are already challenged neurologically, you certainly don&rsquo;t want to be putting any medications in them that might have molds or pesticides,&rdquo; details Chris.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Hugh expounds, &ldquo;Even the most diligent home growers frequently don&rsquo;t even know what they don&rsquo;t even know. I would worry that no matter who we would try, we would still have pesticides or whatever that blew in from next door. So we really choose to go the commercial, professional route. The reality is we really didn&rsquo;t have a ready supply of medicine for our kids locally, which was a challenge.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >The Hempels&rsquo; dream of a modest marijuana endeavor in Reno quickly evolved into operations in three jurisdictions. &ldquo;We won licenses here (Nevada), and those were awarded at roughly the same time rec was starting to take hold in Washington and Colorado so we increased our investment levels in those jurisdictions and began building out really world-class facilities,&rdquo; explains Hugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Since entering the industry in 2013 with the formation of their cannabis brand management company Strainz, Chris and Hugh's companies in Colorado, Washington, and Nevada are &ldquo;making similar, if not identical, products in those three jurisdictions and expanding beyond.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Hugh, who serves as CEO of Strainz, sums it up as &ldquo;one thing led to another and we got licensed in Vegas and we started this national company and everything has snowballed from there. We have gone from relatively modest ambitions to relatively large accomplishments in the four years we have been at it.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Although their entrepreneurial endeavors grew quickly, it&rsquo;s still been a tortuous trudge to get to the end product. &ldquo;The reality is even after all the promises and families that moved to Colorado (seeking CBD oil), I would agree that even today the supply of good CBD medicine is still very difficult. It&rsquo;s literally taken us four years to get to a place where we can actually offer commercial grade CBD product that has THC in it to lots of folks on a relatively predictable basis,&rdquo; explains Hugh. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget if you are going to take kids off benzos or the zombie cocktail, you have to know for sure that you have got the marijuana medicine that&rsquo;s replacing those drugs available to you at all times. You can&rsquo;t take your kids off that stuff and then not have the medicine.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Hugh continues, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s still shocking that the scarcity of high-CBD ratio products like 18 or 20 to 1 is still hard to get. Even to this day, we are finally just growing ourselves in Nevada after being in the industry for four years. We don&rsquo;t have enough of it to supply what we believe is the strong demand that is out there.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >The dearth of cannabis-based medicine was illustrated this past May when the Hempels launched their first products in Nevada. Within three weeks of bringing their Bullet Concentrate brand of hemp seed oil-based tinctures to market, which are almost identical to the products the Hempels have been giving their daughters over the years, they sold out of the distillate-based vape pens made in three different ratios (20:1, 1:1, 1:5).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Product scarcity is a result of the challenging environment the cannabis industry operates in. Between the constantly changing regulatory environment and the banking restrictions, not to mention marijuana being federally illegal, making medicine becomes almost a secondary pursuit.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >One example is what the Hempels refer to as sticker-gate, which is the near constant packaging changes required in each jurisdiction. &ldquo;If you talk to anyone in the cannabis industry, they can tell you about all the costly and very labor-intensive stickers and things they have to put on the products due to the constant regulatory changes,&rdquo; explains Chris, who is co-founder and VP of Communications for Strainz.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Both Hugh and Chris have backgrounds in high-tech having worked at Netscape during the Internet&rsquo;s coming of age in the &lsquo;90s and launching various start-ups in Silicon Valley and, yet, they call the cannabis industry the toughest by far. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not regulatory consistency across the jurisdictions, everybody wants to reinvent the wheel,&rdquo; explains Hugh. In turn, each jurisdiction has its own idea about everything from containers and labels to packaging symbols. For instance, Washington&rsquo;s symbol for THC is different from Colorado&rsquo;s, therefore requiring different packaging.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >As a brand management company, Strainz endeavors to understand the complexities and struggles of the industry to make short order of the challenges it faces. &ldquo;We are on the cutting edge of how we are structuring and how to expand into the various markets because we are dealing with so many complex regulations and state line issues,&rdquo; bottom lines Chris of Strainz. &ldquo;As you want to bring a tincture from Nevada, Colorado and Washington, you have to deal with people that have other partners who have the licensing, cultivation, production, the right kind of equipment, standardized equipment, etc., in order to make the product consistent across state lines unlike a Coca-Cola, which might have a regional bottling plant that can serve multiple states at once.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Hugh compares Strainz to other brand management companies citing Nestl&eacute; and Frito-Lay as examples, noting that, &ldquo;at that level we make recipes, packaging and provide those branded services to our operating partners in each one of the jurisdictions, and these are completely individually owned and operated companies that are affiliated but there is not cross ownership.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Strainz&rsquo; current portfolio includes Bullet Concentrates; Honu, a Washington-based topicals and edibles maker; and Silver State Trading, a cultivator and manufacturer based in Sparks, Nevada producing California Finest, House of Jane, Jimi&rsquo;s Cannabis Collection and Trokie brands. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >In spite of the Hempels&rsquo; big vision for Big Cannabis there is still a lot to understand. &ldquo;We have got a lot to learn about routes of administration, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics -- all these things we have learned about in the drug development stage. We haven&rsquo;t even really begun to scratch the surface of cannabis on that,&rdquo; shares Hugh. &ldquo;Both Chris and I super passionate about the next five years because we can actually really begin to find out how to use the medicine, how to make it more intelligently, how to drive costs down, how to make it more available to more people, how to have to take less of it.</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;That will be the big story of our lifetime, how broadly this plant can help people,&rdquo; concludes Hugh. &ldquo;The deeper we dig into it, the more we uncover potential. Every time we scratch the surface, we come across new applications or we stumble across new things that it helps with.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >While the future is bright for medicinal cannabis, it is gradually dimming for Cassidy and Addison no matter how much their parents further the potential of the plant. &ldquo;They are very severely neurologically compromised and every year we see small signs of progression of the disease. So, at some point, they will cease being able to swallow effectively and will succumb to pneumonia or something similar. That&rsquo;s just reality for us and we just have to face up to that and try and cope with it,&rdquo; explains Hugh.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Most children in their condition don&rsquo;t live past 10 years old,&rdquo; adds Chris. &ldquo;They are 13 years old so we are just grateful for every day we have with them.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Justin Alexander</h3>

<p><span >With the multitude of terpenes available in cannabis, it is important to know what the health benefits are of each. By far the most dominant is myrcene which is well-known for its sedative quality. After that it&rsquo;s a potpourri of terpenes that provide a potpourri of effects. From anti-inflammatory, anti-tumoral and antidepressant properties to analgesic, anti-anxiety and antibiotic effects, there&rsquo;s a terpene for just about every condition.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >The industry is becoming more and more aware of the capabilities of terpenes. Don Decatur, director of operations for City Trees, says he couldn&rsquo;t be happier that the industry and the patients are really embracing the world of terps. &ldquo;[There are] indicas that have uplifting effects as well as sativas that have relaxing effects,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The terpenes are what modulate the effects of THC and other cannabinoids. These are much more important than monikers that are more to differentiate growth traits rather than effects.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Those monikers include the categories by which we have been identifying cannabis strains. &ldquo;Sativa and indica only tell part of the story,&rdquo; says Daniel Wacks, co-founder of State Flower Cannabis. &ldquo;Considering that the majority of the commercially viable genetics are hybrids these days, it's important to look to other indicators, such as terpenes and some of the lesser known cannabinoids, for classification purposes.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Read on as </span><em><span >elevate</span></em><span > checks out some of the market&rsquo;s terpene-heavy products.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Cherry AK from State Flower Cannabis</strong></p>
<p><span >Although rich in the terpene myrcene at 13.24 mg, well-known to be a sedative, don&rsquo;t be deceived by Cherry AK-47&rsquo;s aggressive name. &ldquo;The cherry phenotype of the classic AK-47 strain has many positive qualities,&rdquo; Wacks says of the strain. &ldquo;It is an effective analgesic and the terpene medical efficacy is similar to that of opium, only without the addiction. Myrcene is also known to have antiseptic, antibacterial, antifungal and anti-inflammatory qualities.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Myrcene&rsquo;s sleep inducing quality depends on the amount. &ldquo;Strains containing more than 0.5 percent Myrcene are sedative indicas; strains with less than 0.5 percent Myrcene are typically sativa,&rdquo; offers Wacks.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Another terpene, caryophyllene, also found in Cherry AK and testing in at 4.53 mg, is known as an antioxidant and is good for the treatment of muscle spasms, pain and insomnia.</span></p>
<p><span >State Flower Cannabis&rsquo; philosophy is that terpenes are just as important as cannabinoids and when they harvest their flower, the idea is to preserve both in equal value. &ldquo;Terpenes are classified as VOCs (volatile organic compounds) and they're as delicate as their name implies, which means we take every precaution possible&mdash;from harvesting early when trichome and terpenoid production is at its peak&mdash;to carefully handling our cannabis so that it never touches a bare hand until you open our packaging,&rdquo; says Daniel Wacks, co-founder of State Flower Cannabis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Just when you were starting to understand terpenes, the next big thing will be flavonoids, according to Wacks. &ldquo;The unique smell and flavor of a cannabis strain is actually produced in part by its flavonoids, the aromatic molecules with names like quercetin, luteolin and kaempferol,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;These compounds are found in many plants but cannabis has their own unique class of them called cannaflavins, and they don&rsquo;t just smell good, they are pharmacologically active as well. For example, cannaflavin A has been found to reduce inflammation by inhibiting the inflammatory molecule PGE-2, and it does this 30 times more effectively than aspirin.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>Medizin&rsquo;s Mango Live Resin</strong></p>
<p><span >An indica dominant strain testing at 69.25 percent THC, Mango Kush Live Resin relieves stress, depression, and pain. With its uplifting effects and delicious tropical mango flavor, it has become a go-to for concentrate lovers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >One reason for its popularity is that Mango Kush Live Resin packs lots of the terpene that really delivers best for Las Vegas patients: Myrcene, at a hearty 19.2 mg. &ldquo;Because of its sedative and relaxing indica-like effects, I do feel people love the medicinal qualities of myrcene after a long day in this city that never sleeps,&rdquo; says Dave Farris, general manager of Medizin medical marijuana dispensary.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Mango Kush also has 5.92 mg of limonene (elevated mood and stress relief) as well as low amounts of B-pinene (1.08 mg) and linalool (1.21 mg).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >When talking terps, Farris predicts that limonene is on the rise. &ldquo;Many people love the sweet citrus aroma it translates,&rdquo; he says. His favorite, however, in the ongoing conversation about the aromatherapy of cannabis, is linalool for its ability to reduce stress and deliver anti-anxiety benefits.</span></p>

<p><strong>The+Source&rsquo;s Sin City CBD vape</strong></p>
<p><span >Sin City CBD vape embraces the notion that CBD works best in conjunction with THC to reduce negative side effects such as paranoia and anxiety while working in perfect harmony to reduce inflammation, pain, anxiety, psychosis, spasms and many other ailments. It&rsquo;s all the goodies in one package at a CBD:THC ratio of 1:2.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >But it&rsquo;s not without a strong terpene profile of the ever-popular sleep-inducing myrcene with its earthy, clove-like aroma at 6.78 mg as well as caryophyllene (anti-anxiety and anti-depressant) at 7.17 mg, and 2.98 mg pinene (anti-inflammatory and natural bronchodilator).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Terpenes are such an important factor that in taking flower to an oil, they can often be compromised if not treated carefully. &ldquo;Through trial, error, testing and analytics, we have dialed in a process from extraction through post processing that allows us to preserve much of that original terpene profile that would otherwise be destroyed,&rdquo; explains Sin City&rsquo;s extraction specialist Mark Lucas, who notes while they can&rsquo;t be created, they can be enhanced. &ldquo;What I can do is use different techniques in the lab throughout the extraction and processing that will preserve as much of the natural terpene profile as possible.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >As for other popular terpenes, Lucas points to the interesting borneol terpene with a cool soothing scent that he describes as similar to camphor or eucalyptus. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been used medicinally for ages as a natural anti-fungal and anti-oxidant. It&rsquo;s also a natural pest repellent,&rdquo; says Lucas. &ldquo;Sometimes terpenes aren't there for their smell and they have some other purpose, in this case, keeping bugs away.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Personally, Lucas is also a fan of linalool for its sweet candy-like, floral aroma. &ldquo;Found heavily in plants such as lavender and cocoa, it has been shown to be a major anti-inflammatory, so it helps with pain and arthritis,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Research has also shown linalool can help with anxiety and insomnia due to its sedative properties. Linalool also shows promise in helping fight cancer, MS, epilepsy, leukemia, and even acne.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Giddy Up Extracts&rsquo; Strawberry Fields Terp Sauce</strong></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;I have been saying for 20+ years that it is about the whole experience: smell, taste, and high,&rdquo; says Tony Gentile, Nevada Medical Marijuana&rsquo;s Head of Production. &ldquo;Before I was aware of terpenes, I knew there was a therapeutic effect when you inhale and have a sensory overload from the flavor of the weed. Terpenes are a big part of cannabis but not one terpene is responsible for making any strain what it is.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Strawberry Fields, as a strain, is known for relieving anxiety, asthma, bipolar disorder, chronic pain, depression, headaches, insomnia, migraines, muscle spasms and PTSD. With a rich terpene profile of myrcene (sedative) 14.6 mg, caryophyllene (anti-inflammatory and analgesic) 9.7 mg, humulene (anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory) 2.9 mg, limonene (elevated mood and stress relief) 1.3 mg, and linalool (anti-anxiety and antidepressant) 1.3 mg, Strawberry Fields offers users a rich variety of terpenes to treat numerous conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >As far as looking into his terpene crystal ball, Gentile says there is still so much to be discovered. &ldquo;Right now, the state of Nevada tests for 21 different terps and last time I checked there are 157 plus terps in the cannabis plant.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>Green and Gold Supply&rsquo;s Kosher Kush</strong></p>
<p><span >One of the ideal strains to mellow out those who are high-stress all the time is Kosher Kush. It has a rich and varied terpene profile of limonene (4.30 mg), b-caryophyllene (4.12 mg), and myrcene (1.78 mg) that&nbsp; come together to form a symphony that causes stress to slip away with every inhale.</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;We spend a lot of time with medical patients and adult-use customers explaining terpene profiles and why they are important,&rdquo; says Thrive Nevada&rsquo;s Mitch Britten.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >While he somewhat agrees that the classifying of strains based on indica or sativa to denote the smoking experience is a bit dated, he says that it is still a convenient way for people to understand general categories. &ldquo;As people start to understand how important terpenes are and the role they play, I think we&rsquo;ll see the days of indica/sativa as main identifiers fade away.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >He isn&rsquo;t quick though to jump on the idea of strains being named for their terpenes to make it easier for patients to find what they need. &ldquo;Since I&rsquo;ve been involved in the industry, I&rsquo;ve seen fads come and go&mdash;people naming products for their effects versus naming them for their lineage, etc. I think the names are here to stay and people identify the feeling they want with a popular strain name,&rdquo; concludes Britten.</span></p>

<p><strong>City Trees&rsquo; Terpene-Infused Disposal Vape Pens</strong></p>
<p><span >Named for what they are designed to do, City Trees&rsquo; vape pens relieve pain, induce relaxation, energize your mood, or inspire a blissful state. City Trees&rsquo; newly launched terpene-infused disposable vape line features pure distilled cannabis oil mixed with specific blends of terpenes to create and aid specific effects: pain, relax, bliss and energize. &ldquo;Each one tastes amazing and parodies wonderful effect,&rdquo; offers Don Decatur, director of operations for City Trees.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >City Trees&rsquo; Relax vape is aptly named with an impressive 54 mgs of myrcene. Other terpenes in its profile include linalool (14.65 mg), also a sedative, and d-limonene (5.95 mg), known for its calming effect. With a- and b-pinene as the dominant terpenes (20.30 mg and 13.61 mg, respectively) in City Trees&rsquo; Energize vape, it provides focus and alertness as primary characteristics.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Decatur says he couldn&rsquo;t be happier that the industry and the patients are really embracing the world of terps. &ldquo;[There are] indicas that have uplifting effects as well as sativas that have relaxing effects,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The terpenes are what modulate the effects of THC and other cannabinoids. These are much more important than monikers that are more to differentiate growth traits rather than effects.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>By Richard S. Gubbe</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Snake oil salesmen used to roam the country selling concoctions of who knows what with the pitch, &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll cure whatever ails ya.&rdquo; The same could be said of marijuana before categories and terpene profiles arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anecdotal and scientific evidence streaming in have shown that certain strains of cannabis can indeed help with specific ailments or needs. This new science, still in its infancy, shows strains of cannabis contain distinctly different cannabinoid and terpene profiles that combat everyday maladies as well as life-threatening illness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Advancements in cultivation and changes in testing procedures have created soaring terpene and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) percentages. Additional terpenes and cannabinoids can be added to concentrates for more dramatic effects. Growing techniques are crucial to testing outcomes, but the process begins with the selection of the seed of the strain itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nevadans have the advantage of lab-tested cannabis and with that edge comes a detailed terpene and cannabinoid profile that shows content percentages: THC </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in percentages and terpenes in milligrams. The results aren&rsquo;t exact as batches of cannabis can vary slightly and tests aren&rsquo;t always accurate. Tests supply the guidance necessary to take out much of the guesswork of picking strains for specific purposes as each batch comes with a certificate of analysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The onset of strain analysis started with two basic categories (indica and sativa) that created a third in hybrids, with myriad choices to crossbreed plants. The coolest part is there is little harm in trying things, with the exception of giving anxiety patients an accelerant.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>There&rsquo;s High and Higher</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The star power for most cannabis smokers is THC count, while most purists and growers point to the terpene profile as more of a healing guide. If the terpene count, measured in miniscule amounts, doesn&rsquo;t contain a decent quantity of the terpene that synergistically supports the goal, then why smoke it? The novice smoker believes that THC is the key and, yet, it would be a challenge to taste test the difference between 22 and 26 percent THC. The new goal should be terpene stats. All plants have THC so if more THC is necessary, then smoke two joints instead of one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THC percentages have soared, but sometimes testing procedures are altered to create a higher number. After all, THC count dictates the price a dispensary can get for flower. In the past decade, THC percentages have soared over 20 percent to reach as high as 36 percent. Many growers, including Serenity Wellness&rsquo;s Don Decatur, doubt their authenticity, adding the methods change from lab to lab. There are 11 licensed labs in Nevada.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&ldquo;The CBD number or the amount of terpenes didn&rsquo;t matter to most and pricing was dictated by the THC number more than anything else, and still is,&rdquo; Decatur says.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While THC is plentiful in flower, terpenes not so much. If the profile is weak on terpenes, pain relief and nausea that rely on THC will still be effective. Terpenes, however, have been found to be the driving healing force in many strains. Pink Frost, for instance, has a THC count in the teens, but provides significant impact due to terpenes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Pink Frost is one of the best overall strains we have,&rdquo; says Matthew Gardner, VP at Shango, &ldquo;it is a gentle, smooth hybrid with myrcene dominating the terpene profile along with notable amounts of linalool and a dash of limonene. This frosty blend, like others with THC between 15 and 20 percent, is sold at a reasonable price and proves sledgehammers aren&rsquo;t always necessary.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>Sativa vs. the World</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One Internet description of a sativa claims: &ldquo;This mighty sativa delivers upbeat effects while relaxing the mind and melting away stress.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funny, that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a mighty sativa. How can it be both?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a general sense, pure sativas have an energetic, uplifting effect, yet each strain can vary based on the dominant terpenes in each. The old axiom was more than .05 milligrams per gram of myrcene means it came from an indica or an indica-dominant hybrid. Now there are sativas with high myrcene counts over 2.0.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sativa and indica were divided into whether a plant is an accelerant or provides a calming nature. Myrcene for indica strains and limonene for sativas are the driving forces for those results. Myrcene provides tranquility, helps alleviate stress, aids with sleep and provides pain relief, all very similar traits to an indica. Limonene, a source of near-endless energy, matches well with sativas, which bring energy, creativity and focus.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The differentiation of sativa versus indica resulted because both plants differ structurally. &ldquo;People need to stop categorizing strains in that way only,&rdquo; Gardner admonishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decatur agrees. &ldquo;There is a lot more to it than the growth pattern or leaf structure,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There is a lot of miseducation. We can forget about just using these (indica and sativa) classifications.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><strong>Voted Most Popular</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New strains are being created weekly, many of which come from California and, in turn, are sold only in California since Nevada dispensaries can only sell Nevada-grown plants. As a cannabis expert, Decatur believes the most potent and best healing strains come from California.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With generations of crossbreeding and male-female separation, old strains exist in name only. These are popular sellers:</span></p>
<p><strong>Girl Scout Cookie (GSC):</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Girl Scout Cookies is an OG Kush and Durban Poison hybrid cross whose reputation grew too large to stay within the borders of its homeland.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This California creation has won numerous Cannabis Cup awards. &ldquo;Cookies is the new OG,&rdquo; Decatur reports, adding, &ldquo;GSC has become a mega strain.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">GSC strains can feature high THC doses for pain relief and nausea, yet still provide energy. The high amount of caryophyllene combined with limonene and humulene form a potent mix of healing and activity that make any cookie strain enticing. Now there&rsquo;s spinoffs: Platinum, Cookies and Cream, and Thin Mint Cookies.</span></p>
<p><strong>OG Kush: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">A venerable strain found on the West Coast that is the genetic parent of many since, the strain helps with stress, migraines and, most certainly, anxiety.</span></p>
<p><strong>Durban Poison:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Originally from the coast of South Africa, this strain remains in name only. Mentioned in the Humble Pie song &ldquo;30 Days in the Hole,&rdquo; this strain is worldly in popularity with high THC and terpene percentages wherever it may hail from now. </span></p>
<p><strong>Sour Diesel:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> A sativa-dominant strain that can stimulate the body, relax the mind, and help with stress and anxiety while staying active.</span></p>
<p><strong>Jack Herer:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This award-winner from the Netherlands is a global favorite with a sativa-dominated, cerebral high and powerful healing capabilities. Jack Herer is said to enhance creativity, along with Chemdawg, Jilly Bean, Purple and all orange strains.</span></p>
<p><strong>Blue Dream: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the world&rsquo;s most popular strains, the sativa-based hybrid comes from California and is found in many Nevada dispensaries. With genetics of Sativa Haze and Indica Blueberry, Blue Dream is a good place for beginners to gauge whether they like the euphoric high from myrcene, pinene and caryophyllene along with a little spring in their step. With its wide profile, availability and big yields, this may be the state&rsquo;s best seller. Which is a bonus since, according to Decatur, &ldquo;Blue Dream has great medicinal properties.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the following strains aren&rsquo;t quite as popular, they do have beneficial attributes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Cherry Pie:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The offspring of the venerable strain Granddaddy Purple (GDP) and Durban Poison, Cherry Pie enhances appetite with a fruity flavor and the stress relief of GDP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>XJ-13:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Combines Jack Herer&rsquo;s genetics with G13 Haze to create a stimulating strain with mellow overtones.</span></p>
<p><strong>Bruce Banner:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Harnessing the punch of the Incredible Hulk with a powerful THC explosion for a daytime buzz that comes with pain relief, Bruce Banner&rsquo;s genetics are OG Kush and Strawberry Diesel.</span></p>
<p><strong>Gorilla Glue:</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> With four strains of its own, descending from Chocolate Diesel and Sour Dubb, that are hard-hitting indicas and Cannabis Cup Award winners.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>What&rsquo;s in a Name?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where have you gone Acapulco Gold, Panama Red and Durban Poison?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decatur warns that many of the old favorites</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">appear now in name only. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true Durban Poison -- that&rsquo;s been gone for many years,&rdquo; he reports. &ldquo;Unless you are a world traveler, you&rsquo;d have to be an old-timer with a vast collection of seeds.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acapulco Gold is a dominant sativa and, yet, its profile is myrcene, pinene and caryophyllene. Panama Red is a straight indica and has a sedative effect. Both are not from their native lands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;&ldquo;They are not sought by breeders because they </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">are so unstable,&rdquo; Decatur warns of indigenous plants. &ldquo;If they didn&rsquo;t produce seeds on their own, they would be extinct.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what if the name doesn&rsquo;t sell? &ldquo;Some dispensaries are changing the names to whatever they want if it&rsquo;s not selling,&rdquo; Decatur explains.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">elevate</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> backs up his claim through multiple sources, which makes expanding the profile more important.</span></p>

<p><strong>Know More than Your Budtender</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To make strains more potent, genome mapping, DNA sequencing, and early plant testing are new additions to the science of medical cannabis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;The hippies came up with the most popular varieties, now we can advance it so much faster,&rdquo; Decatur says, adding that he&rsquo;s been approached by companies seeking certain profiles for concentrates.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The state of Nevada tests for 11 terpenes, but there are three key terpenes not on the list: Valencene, Eucalyptol and Citral.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Valencene, present in Valencia oranges, contributes to a plant&rsquo;s citrus aroma and is found in all orange strains. Valencene could be the most dominant terpene in a profile, according to Decatur.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eucalyptol isn&rsquo;t a common terpene but can be found in small amounts in Super Silver Haze and </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is good for treating sinus problems. Citral is the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">scent used in cleaning agents but also is found in citrus strains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Citral increases the effect of myrcene by ten times and labs don&rsquo;t test for that,&rdquo; offers Decatur. &ldquo;Several cannabinoids aren&rsquo;t being quantified in </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">these results, either. Hopefully, they will start testing for those.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember, this is just a sampling. The strain just has to be grown here and there are no restrictions as to what can be grown as long as it&rsquo;s tested. If a favorite healing strain isn&rsquo;t listed, then keep it a secret. Shhhhhhh!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look at menus online as well as to Weedmaps, Leafly or others for descriptions. Some dispensaries are more secretive than others about terpene percentages and stats often have to be requested. Recently, there have been labels seen with only the top two terpenes listed. If those two are both under 2.0, the strain is weak and should be turned into vape cartridges or used for edibles.</span></p>

<p><strong>The Future is Now</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Decatur and others are devising delivery systems such as drinks and tinctures with combinations of terpenes, THC, and/or CBD for ailments and weight loss. Forget having to find a strain with an abundance of humulene when it&rsquo;s in a bottle, can or vape pen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Decatur is producing terpene water and vape pens without cannabinoids for specific uses that include pain, energy stimulation, relaxation, and bliss for a new company, City Trees, a subsidiary of Serenity Wellness. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s botanically derived, non-GMO, organically produced, 100 percent from non-cannabis plants,&rdquo; he reveals to </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">elevate</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gardner says Shango is mixing terpenes with cannabinoids in new cartridge varieties and others are following suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Former NFL player and cannabis advocate Kyle Turley has produced a hemp product with CBD and a proprietary mix of terpenes called Neuro Armour that is legal across the United States (see page 10 for full story). He uses the same formula with a range of delivery systems that is promising in the area of treating CTE and PTSD.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These innovative products from City Trees and Neuro Armour provide new options for solutions to old problems. &ldquo;The intricacies of cannabis go deep,&rdquo; Decatur concludes. &ldquo;If you are not learning every day, you are falling behind.&rdquo;</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Field Report:</strong><span > Dab Another Day </span><span ><br /></span><strong>Agent: </strong><span >#00710 Bong, James</span><span ><br /></span><strong>Mission:</strong><span > TheFirefly2 &amp; The Icarus OG Kush</span><span ><br /></span><strong>Status:</strong><span > 00710 APPROVED</span></p>

<p><span >The name&rsquo;s Bong. James Bong, 00710. To prepare for my latest mission, Dab Another Day, I checked into the Greenlane Dispensary Services Lab where I was greeted by HighQ, who outfitted me with the latest secret weapon to help me solve the mystery of the Icarus OG Kush.&nbsp; I was presented with the Firefly 2, a high-tech, palm-sized vaporizer, available in a multitude of colors. I selected Jet Black so it would camouflage well with my new V12 Vanquish Aston Martin.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span >To start, I had to activate the device. I downloaded the FireFly app, connected to the device and named it Jinx. Next, I popped off the magnetic glass top with ease and revealed a mirror platform with a deep glass bowl ready to be loaded with flower or concentrate. I was immediately taken with the design, noting how easy it would be to load even while in hot pursuit of Gustav Graves. This was the work of some stellar canna-craftsmanship.</span></p>

<p><span >Now for the real test&hellip;how does it vape? I gently pressed a concentrate pad (included with device) into the bowl and loaded some Gorilla Glue#4 Cake Badder by Matrix NV, cause that&rsquo;s how I roll. I learned that flower can be broken into small buds and packed directly into the bowl, but concentrates must be placed on the pad to avoid clogging the laser-drilled microjets. I was careful not to skip this step &ndash; Bong Girls don&rsquo;t like clogged jets.</span></p>

<p><span >Through the app, I selected my desired heat setting &ndash; this, I learned, is mission critical to achieving the perfect flavor profile. Then, I waited for the blinking green light at the top of the device to turn solid, indicating that my desired temperature was reached. I held down the two-touch sensor triggers and took a few deep puffs, watching the bowl radiate a brilliant red glow&hellip;and BAM! My face melted faster than the Ice Hotel when it was hit by the Icarus OG Kush. That first hit launched me to an alternate dimension of terpene profiles. I wanted more, and fast. Like the double agent I am, I interchanged flowers, concentrates, cake badder, shatter, live resin and sap, each one sending me on a flavor journey that elevated my cannabis experience to a whole new level&hellip;not to mention, I got high as hell.</span></p>

<p><span >To be blunt, there are a few issues with the Firefly2 that may cause an aspiring secret agent to abort the mission. First and foremost is the price. It&rsquo;s an investment at $329.99, but well worth it for the serious double-0-dabber. And trust me, after a few practice rips, you&rsquo;ll understand why. I would be lying if I said it didn&rsquo;t take me, 00710, some time to perfect the Firefly 2 &ndash; the battery overheats quickly and the mirror platform can get sticky from the concentrates. But after an incredible session with Lemon Cookies Oil by Matrix NV, it earned a permanent spot in my canna-arsenal.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span >I cannot reveal the whereabouts of the Icarus OG Kush, but I can tell you that without the Firefly 2, I wouldn&rsquo;t have lived to dab another day. As I sit back, relax and prepare for my next mission, I feel confident with this impressive piece of technology by my side. With the Firefly 2, there&rsquo;s no terpene profile too complex, too elusive, or too intricate that I can&rsquo;t handle. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span >Until the next toke, my friends, this is James Bong, 00710, saying &ldquo;I like my concentrates shaken, not stirred.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Firefly 2 Retail Price: </strong><span >$329.99</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span >&ldquo;Before, I had to eat potatoes for a whole month to be able to get the license, literally, and that ain&rsquo;t no joke or lie,&rdquo; explains Ken Zalut, 54, of scrimping and saving to apply for his state of Nevada medical marijuana patient card. &ldquo;The first year I had to get my license it cost me $500 but now a patient can get it for about $200, depending on which doctor they go to. But considering I get $1000 a month from social security that&rsquo;s 20 percent of what I get.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >This year, Zalut was able to avoid eating a monthlong starch-fueled diet thanks to a local program called &lsquo;Patients Helping Patients.&rsquo; The goal of the free program, which was started by ShowGrow dispensary last December, is to financially assist 10 patients each month in applying for and receiving their medical marijuana patient card from the state of Nevada.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;We realized a lot of the patients that were coming in here and receiving help for their chronic illnesses had many friends and acquaintances, whether it be at their support groups, pain relief centers or Comprehensive Cancer Treatment Centers, who were going through the same things and were unable to afford a fairly expensive fee to become part of the state&rsquo;s medical marijuana program,&rdquo; details James Hammer, manager of ShowGrow dispensary. &ldquo;They are people with really high medical bills as it is and we wanted to do something to assist those people so they could receive an alternative form of treatment to assist them in actually relieving pain or easing their symptoms.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >To date &lsquo;Patients Helping Patients&rsquo; (PHP) has been able to aid more than 40 people suffering from a severe disease or condition to receive their medical marijuana patient cards. It&rsquo;s a group effort for the program to work. Referrals for the program come from nonprofits, pain clinics, cancer centers, or people from support groups. Sun Valley Certification Clinic donates the doctor recommendations necessary to apply for a patient card.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;Sun Valley consults with the patient and provides them with a free doctor&rsquo;s recommendation and then the money we generate at ShowGrow pays for the state filing fee of $100,&rdquo; explains Hammer of the funding sources for PHP.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Zalut, who uses medical cannabis to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) and to keep lymphoma and testicular cancer at bay, received his patient card in May through the PHP program. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in remission,&rdquo; Zalut relays of his cancer which was first diagnosed in 2003, &ldquo;but the MS is raging. It&rsquo;s a matter of quantities and stress, I have to go into debt right now to pay for my medicine. I am living on credit cards trying to make ends meet. It&rsquo;s been pretty rough, between money and transportation. Yesterday, I had to take seven buses to get to Canopi just to get a little medicine.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >According to PHP participant Stacey Julian, medical cannabis has saved her life. &ldquo;I now use THC oil daily and I am able to function. On the days I run out, I start going backwards so I never want to stop. The health benefit has made the difference in life and death for me,&rdquo; she explains, adding, &ldquo;my experience getting my marijuana card was smooth and with the help of the PHP program I was able to renew my license when I couldn't afford it due to my disability from an assault.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span >Elaina, who didn&rsquo;t wish to disclose her last name, is another cannabis patient who got her card through PHP. Born with cataracts which had to be removed when she was a baby, Elaina developed glaucoma later in life. &ldquo;I was also born with skeletal dysplasia, scoliosis, and arthritis. My glaucoma was so out of control that even with three different eye drops I became blind in my left eye. My pressures were in the high 50s and the doctors didn't know what else they could do. The pain from all of my other issues was extremely severe even though I was given narcotic medication to help ease the pain,&rdquo; explains Elaina.</span></p>
<p><span >After receiving her medical card through &rsquo;Patients Helping Patients,&rsquo; &ldquo;the pressures in my eyes are now in the low teens and my pain is bearable. I do not use marijuana to get "high," I use it to help my pain and lower my eye pressures so that I no longer get severe headaches from it,&rdquo; Elaina explains. &ldquo;My life has changed for the better and I have this amazing program to thank for it, otherwise, I would have not been able to afford getting the card on my own.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >If you know someone suffering from a severe disease or condition who is in need of a Nevada medical marijuana patient card, contact ShowGrow about the &lsquo;Patients Helping Patients &rsquo; program at 702.227.0511.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Neal Levine’s philosophy for life has always been focused on the journey, not the destination. “If you try to do the right thing, everything else will take care of itself. I was going to be a rock star and then work in third-party politics so it’s not like I had a career path really well planned out,” Levine wryly notes of his foray into the cannabis industry. “I was trying to do the right thing and it led me to the place I was supposed to be. It was about being on the adventure.”

Why did you get involved in the cannabis industry?  </a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">
Way back when, when I was in my early twenties I was going to be a rock star, turned out I wasn’t. I ended up going to Minnesota for a record deal, I didn’t get the record deal but I did get caught up in Jesse Ventura’s campaign for governor. After Jesse was elected, I was in my early 20s, I was elected as the chair of the 5th Congressional District for his party. So, I am this 24-year-old kid on the state executive committee of the third party that controls the governor’s mansion. From there I started to get hired to work on campaigns and at the end of 2002 I was hired by the Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) to run all their statewide and local ballot initiatives; and, in that role, I had the honor of leading the teams to pass a bunch of these laws. 
I left MPP in 2009 to work at R&R Partners, from there I went into private practice and worked on ballot initiative stuff and had some cannabis clients I was working with on regulatory and ballot initiative stuff. I was part of the lobbying that helped get the Nevada dispensary laws through the Nevada Legislature in 2013, I ran the signature drive that qualified the legalization measure for the ballot in 2016, I ran that signature drive in 2014. And I ran the Alaska campaign in 2014 and did a bunch of cannabis stuff. Then being one of the national experts in the field, I formally moved into the industry with LivWell.

When did working in the cannabis industry become more than a job? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It took about eight months on the job before I became completely dogmatic about and radicalized on the issue. I can tell you the exact moment I became radicalized. In 2004, I was overseeing the state lobbying campaign that would pass the first medical marijuana law in Vermont. I was filming a TV ad with a multiple sclerosis (MS) patient. This MS patient’s wife had passed away from cancer, he had two teenage sons and the state had taken away his sons because he was unable to care for them because his MS was so severe. Through the recommendation of a friend he started taking cannabis illegally and was able to wean himself off almost all of his prescription medication and was able to get his kids back. 
So, I am filming this gentleman for an ad to support our lobbying efforts at the state capital and while I am filming him, I am thinking I am going to put this on TV and he could lose his kids, and it’s really starting to get to me. During a break in the filming he leans in and he asks me, ‘Do you know why I am doing this?’. I said, ‘I didn’t,’ and he said, ‘cause it’s the right to do.’ And he says, ‘I want you to promise me one thing. I want you to promise me that when you go back to Washington, D.C. and you are back in your office, you are going to work nonstop to get this law passed because, yes, by doing this I could lose my kids. This isn’t so much for me as for the people who come after me. So, if you make me that promise I will sign any release that you have.’ 
With tears running down my face, I promised on the spot and I did exactly what I promised I would. A couple of months later we passed the first medical marijuana law in the state of Vermont in 2004. That was the exact moment it went from being a job to me to being about something that became my life’s work that I care passionately and deeply about.

How has the cannabis industry changed since you entered the space? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It didn’t really exist. When I started at MMP (Marijuana Policy Project) in 2003 there were eight medically legal states and the only industry that really existed was the unregulated industry in California, which, at the time, was the subject of active DEA raids. It was nothing like the industry that exists today. Since I started doing this work, the laws have become more and more defined and created an industry with real regulations.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Demographics and exposure. If you take a look at any polling on the issue, the Greatest Generation is really opposed to cannabis, Baby Boomers are a coinflip, Gen Exers are in favor, and Millennials are really in favor. As Baby Boomers become retirees and Gen Exers become middle-aged, you are just seeing the polling move with the demographics. I think that’s a large part of it. The other part of it is exposure. The Greatest Generation was not exposed to cannabis, whereas Millennials have grown up in a society where more than half the states have regulated cannabis and have been without prohibition in some form.

Why did you form the New Federalism Fund (NFF)? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

 As an industry, it all comes down to the fact that we are illegal under federal law. Coming out of the election with the names that were being floated for Attorney General and as a one-party government, we realized that we could be entering a potentially precarious time as an industry. The other thing that we realized was we didn’t see a lot of folks who were out there trying to engage these folks in a positive constructive dialogue. Because they were saying things about us that seemed to be based on misinformation or old tropes, it just became very apparent very fast that they didn’t know who we were and what we were doing as an industry. There was a real need for us to engage in a positive constructive dialogue along the lines of federalism. 
We are not asking for any special treatment, we are just asking to be treated like any other business in any other industry, that’s all we are asking for. Don’t close us down, let us have an equitable tax structure like any other business in the country and let us use a bank -- those are the lobbying principles that NFF is working toward. Because it is such an issue and such a strain on the industry, we could be providing so many more jobs and so many more economic benefits if we were treated like any other industry. That is why we formed NFF to work on those issues and tell our story and educate people because so many people are unaware of the regulatory environment we operate in and the enormous tax burden that we carry.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

To engage in a constructive dialogue. As an industry, NFF is not weighing in on federal legalization one way or another. There’s lots of great organizations out there working on that so we have no formal position on federal legalization. We are focused on three buckets: allowing us to continue to operate, trying to get an equitable tax structure by reforming 280E, and allowing us to use a bank, which is really a public safety thing. It doesn’t serve anybody’s interest to have that much cash on the street and it serves the government’s interest that they can track the money electronically. We are a very odd industry in that we are going to government wanting to be taxed and regulated. We aren’t asking for special favors, we just want to be treated like everybody else.

Every day at LivWell we try to be the industry that we want to be a part of. That’s our core guiding philosophy as a company culture. Everything we do from our political engagement, to reinvesting in our communities, to paying our employees several dollars above minimum wage for entry level positions, to paying all their healthcare, to having a 401K that is three percent andt vests instantly, to being innovative and cutting edge in the kind of products we offer, to engaging with our regulators, to being at the forefront for safety features and pushing those sorts of things. As an industry, overall, we don’t lobby for any sort of competitive advantage or for any sort of regs, we lobby for a clean, level playing field for all. On the federal side, we are lobbying to be treated like any other industry. We would be incredibly hypocritical to lobby locally to get a leg up within our own industry. In everything we do and everything we say, we try to advance the industry as part of the culture of our company.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Cannabis is something that is incredibly popular and almost all of our customers are coming from the criminal markets. As far as cannabis use in this country, I think even we were surprised at how prevalent it actually is, and underreported. Yes, we absolutely want to disrupt the cartels. We think that is better for our community. We think it is better for our children if the folks who are selling cannabis are regulated or licensed, go through background checks, request ID, are under the age of 21, and that there is a camera on every square inch of every property that we own and operate. We feel that is how cannabis should be grown, licensed, and sold in this country. We absolutely want to disrupt the criminal markets. We pay taxes. Whereas if you go after the criminal market, it costs taxes to prosecute. And we self-regulate and every state system makes you go through a background check before you are even allowed to work in the industry and you get rebadged every two years in Colorado. It’s not just criminal background history that they are looking at. They want to make sure you paid your taxes, and are up to date on your child support. We are an incredibly transparent industry and feel this is how cannabis should be sold in this country and the upshot is we are able to provide all of these jobs and all of this economic benefit and increase public safety that comes with disrupting the cartels, it’s really exciting that we get to be part of that.

What’s your argument for federal prohibition to be lifted?

<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

If we can all agree on one thing -- cannabis is not going to be eradicated off the face of this earth. If that’s true than someone is going to sell it. Cannabis is popular. It’s proven to be popular in criminal markets and regulated markets. Almost all of our customers come from the criminal market. We are not creating new cannabis consumers, we are taking this out of the dark and into the light. If we can agree that it’s not going to be eradicated off the face of the earth and someone is going to sell it, now you have a binary choice. It’s going to be sold by criminals or by a regular transparent business. 
You can know who we are because we go through safe background checks, know where we are, know who we are selling it to, and what’s in our product. Or you can have a product that you don’t know who is selling it, where they are, who they are selling it to, or what’s in it. So, we feel that regulation is a much better way as a society to deal with cannabis, and we feel that is going to be proven repeatedly in a more regulated market.

Based on his public comments, I think that the Attorney General certainly has a lot of misperceptions about who we are and what we do as an industry. We are just trying to engage in a dialogue to show him who we actually are. We think we are being somewhat impactful on that but I do not have a crystal ball to tell you what he may or may not do. We have heard they are working on revising the Cole memo. He hasn’t done that yet so I am guessing he is waiting for what comes out of the task force he has put together.

Why is 280E such a hot-button topic? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEleven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Under 280E, there is this stubborn misperception out there that we are marijuana moguls. I can tell you as one of the largest companies in the space, we have the honor of collecting the most money and handing it to the IRS. We are not allowed to take any of the standard business deductions outside of the true cost of goods. A lot of people don’t understand this. What that means in plain English is we have an effective tax burden that is just under 80 percent. There are companies I have seen with a tax burden of around 90 percent. Not only that, but if you are audited by the IRS and they disagree with what you call a true cost of goods, there is a 20 percent penalty on top of that. 
The story behind 280E is fascinating, people don’t realize the US Supreme Court in 1969 unanimously ruled that cannabis prohibition was unconstitutional. So, the Nixon Administration then responded with a constitutionally defensible prohibition scheme which is the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 which created the schedules. Nixon had a problem, there was no scientific basis to put marijuana in Schedule 1 so he formed a handpicked commission to give him the proof that he needed to put marijuana into Schedule 1. Nixon forms the Shafer Commission and comes back in a couple of years and says marijuana shouldn’t be legal and removed the temporary designation from Schedule 1 and that’s how marijuana becomes a Schedule 1 controlled substance. Fast forward to the mid-‘70s, an industrious cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana dealer in Minneapolis filed for standard business dedications for his illegal drug dealing business. The IRS denies him and he goes to court and wins on a bunch of his deductions. So, in 1982 Congress responds by passing 280E. 
If you traffic in Schedule 1 or 2 controlled substances, that’s illegal under state or federal law. You may not take any standard business deductions outside of the true cost of goods sold. Then our industry comes to life 20 years later -- they never envisioned people like us existing and 280E was meant to apply to businesses like ours. So, the IRS’ aggressive use of 280E against legal licensed transparent businesses, and we are illegal under federal law, so we fall under 280E, because it says state AND federal law. It is not meant for businesses like ours and its being aggressively applied. It’s supposed to take profits away from drug dealers but it’s not allowing businesses like ours to properly scale and, more importantly, there’s this misperception out there that we are all rolling in cash and we are not.

What’s been the most surprising development in cannabis you have seen since you became involved in the industry? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwelve" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

We always knew that cannabis had medicinal properties specifically for hunger in AIDS patients, and for cancer in stimulating appetite and helping with pain relief. But what we didn’t know was how effective it could be in treating seizure conditions. The most surprising development for me has been meeting some of these parents and kids that have Dravet’s syndrome and these horrible seizure conditions and seeing how absolutely miraculous cannabis can be in treating that and how effective it is. When all these FDA medications just don’t work, these people are desperate and they will try anything to save their kids and then cannabis works. It goes in hand in hand with the most infuriating thing, which is that by now this should be figured out. You see these kids and their parents and they are trying to figure out what oil works, what dose works, how they can get the medicine, how they can get a steady supply of medicine that they can afford, and they can’t use their insurance for it. At this stage of the game, because cannabis is Schedule 1, the research hasn’t been done. This stuff should be dialed in. These kids should not be suffering the way that they are. The fact that we know that this exists, and the fact that parents are out there trying to put this together themselves is ridiculous. As a company, it’s our honor to be able to help patients like that. The biggest surprise to me is how absolutely effective cannabis has proven to be for these seizure conditions, and absolutely infuriating that we are not further down that road.

As a company, LivWell has shown that we have been incredibly engaged in our communities and politically. We have really stepped up in being engaged and involved on the federal, state, and local levels with basic engagement in the communities we operate in. Whether it’s lobbying for reform, forming the New Federalism Fund, engaging and telling our story on the federal level, working with our regulators to be upstanding corporate citizens on the state and local level, or engaged in charities in the communities in which we operate -- that is how we have had the greatest impact as a company. Being in this industry and being one of the largest players in the industry, we feel, as part of our culture, it is incumbent upon us to act like the industry that we would like to be a part of. We try to lead by example.

We will have an equitable tax structure like any other industry. We will be allowed to use a bank. Federal prohibition will likely end in some sort of 10th Amendment solution that defers to the states. I don’t know if we will ever have cannabis legal federally, but I think we will have it not illegal federally and it will go to the states, which is how it should be. I think we will see that within the next ten years.

<p><span >As the cannabis industry continues to grow, businesses are homing in on the finer points of how the space best operates. One newly launched company, Focus Distribution, is doing just that using their insider knowledge of the cannabis distribution and transportation arena. Operated by owners who have worked in the production and dispensary side of Nevada&rsquo;s MME space, the principals at Focus know firsthand some of the challenging areas MMEs encounter.</span></p>

<p><span >One of the most common problems has to do with ensuring the integrity of the product. &ldquo;I was doing distribution during medical, so I know some of the issues that come into play, especially here in Nevada with the heat,&rdquo; explains Focus Distribution CEO Christi McAdams, who also spent three years working in the production space in both Nevada and California. &ldquo;It was very important that our fleet of vehicles was outfitted with custom refrigeration units so as to keep the integrity of the product -- whether it&rsquo;s edibles or flower. </span></p>

<p><span >&ldquo;Obviously with things like edibles, the integrity of the form of the chocolate is paramount. But delicacy of flower products also needs to be considered. If you have it out in the heat for a few hours, its microbial count is multiplying and by the time you get it to the actual dispensary, after it has been in the heat for a few hours, that microbial count could have increased to limits that won&rsquo;t allow it to pass. So, having it in an environment that&rsquo;s cold and fresh like the one our vehicles are equipped with is vital to keeping the integrity of the product.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span >Comprehensive knowledge of cannabis is also instilled in every Focus team member. &ldquo;All of our staff is not just trained in how to be safe and how to deliver things under state regulations, they are trained in all of the cannabis science,&rdquo; explains McAdams. &ldquo;They have had extensive training and have gone through what a normal budtender would go through to understand everything from cannabis consumption methods to all of the necessary packaging and state requirements. It was very important to us that we ensured our team understands the special needs of our industry.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span >Those special needs also include knowing key details about every business Focus works with. &ldquo;We are unique compared to the other distributors in that we aren&rsquo;t partnering you with a traditional delivery person, we are giving each of our customers a designated account representative. That account representative will learn everything about your business -- from your product line to the mission of your company -- so when they are out doing deliveries they are also promoting you,&rdquo; says McAdams. </span></p>

<p><span >That knowledge will come in handy for Focus account representatives when they are visiting other MMEs. &ldquo;We are not just a delivery service, we are your resource for not only buying and selling your products, but also helping to be the liaison between the cultivation, and production and dispensaries,&rdquo; says McAdams, who continues, &ldquo;our team members will also know when they go out to cultivations and dispensaries what businesses have excess amounts of, and what they need. Our dedicated account representatives are already facilitating our customers in getting them trim, selling oil, and making those different connections for people.&rdquo;</span><span ><br /><br /></span></p>
<p><span >Focus is also committed to implementing the strictest security measures possible. Their fleet of vehicles is custom built to include three levels of security: locked van doors, a secure vault, and locked transport carriers. Focus vehicles also have GPS tracking with special software allowing for all customers to track their deliveries. &ldquo;Not only have we outfitted our vehicles with the tightest security features, but we also have a strategic partner, a retired police lieutenant, who trains everyone on our staff,&rdquo; relays McAdams. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span >Although excellent customer service, comprehensive education, and stringent security measures are all of the upmost importance, there is one feature Focus offers that sets them apart in the marketplace. &ldquo;We are not a plain Jane delivery service. We are a comprehensive distribution company, providing dedicated account representatives who act as a true liaison between marijuana establishments. We take time with each customer to ensure complete satisfaction,&rdquo; explains McAdams. &nbsp;</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span >The NICCE Exchange uses the future of financial technology to solve the banking problem of the cannabis industry, today. NICCE, which stands for Nevada In-State Crypto-Commodity Exchange, is a digital asset exchange for trading blockchain commodities known as Nevada In-State Crypto-Commodity (NICC).</span></p>
<p><span >NICC is a custom crypto-commodity that is based on one of the largest enterprise blockchain systems called ONLI&reg;. According to Goldman Sachs, the technology&nbsp;&ldquo;has the potential to redefine transactions&rdquo; and&nbsp;can change &ldquo;everything.&rdquo; The important thing to understand is that it has nothing to do with bitcoin. ONLI was built specifically for financial institutions and central banks to configure it so they can conform to regulatory frameworks. It&rsquo;s different from the ground up. </span></p>
<p><span >NICCs have many features that no other digital system has. NICCs are in-state only, meaning they only work in the state of Nevada. NICCs are private but not anonymous like Bitcoin. NICC is a commodity, not a currency, meaning its value cannot disappear like most other crypto-currencies, whose value depends on many people trading it back and forth. The NICCE Exchange is a B2B payment system, not consumer based. Some of the largest cannabis and non-cannabis businesses already accept it. Because it is digital, the fees are substantially less than traditional banking fees. </span></p>
<p><span >Convenient and easy to use, when you need to get your money out, you sell your commodities on the exchange much like you would any commodity, such as gold or copper. The proceeds from the sale of a commodity are wired from the buyer directly to the seller. Confirmation and processing are nearly instant, which is unlike most crypto-coins and even conventional financial systems. Think of NICC as Nevada&rsquo;s own private state digital money or, even better, like a statewide digital casino chip. </span></p>
<p><span >If you are a cannabis related company, you must first obtain a compliance ID to purchase NICCs for cash. As one of the leaders in marijuana banking compliance auditing, ICS provides customized BSA software for major banks and is designed to meet heightened FinCEN guidelines. ICS integrates with all major seed-to-sale software. Once you have a compliance ID you may become a member of the NICCE Digital Exchange and purchase NICCs for cash. As a B2B platform, you can use NICC to transfer commodities to pay landlords, vendors, wholesalers, growers, payroll and even utilities. Because NICC liquidity is guaranteed, the proceeds from the first sale of the commodity are held in trust so that in the event there isn&rsquo;t a buyer for the commodity on the exchange, any member can redeem the commodities at any time for those proceeds. </span></p>
<p><span >NICCE Digital Exchange is a unique combination of features and technology that solve the banking problem and still fit within regulatory frameworks. The NICCE Exchange is using the future of financial technologies to leap ahead and solve the needs of an unbanked industry today.</span></p>

		<title>NV CANN LABS’ SCIENTIFIC DIRECTOR CONCENTRATES ON BRINGING QUALITY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE TO NEVADA MARKETPLACE</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span >Practically a veteran in the industry, Brenda Perkins opened Arizona&rsquo;s first cannabis testing lab in 2011. Although that doesn&rsquo;t seem that long ago, measured in cannabis years, it&rsquo;s eons. </span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;When I started, the cannabis industry was so new there were hardly any labs operating. It was a very new science. We were still using GCs [</span><span >gas chromatography] </span><span >because we didn&rsquo;t fully understand the effects of </span><span >decarboxylation</span><span > and the benefits of testing using HPLCs [</span><span >high performance liquid chromatography]</span><span >. I have ridden the wave and been persistent and adaptive, improving cannabis testing despite the evolving industry and testing market. I&rsquo;m well practiced, having owned and operated cannabis labs since prior to the introduction of testing for pesticides and residual solvents, before marijuana was required to be tested and treated as a true medicine and commodity,&rdquo; explained Perkins.</span></p>
<p><span >Because Perkins has grown with the nascent industry, she brings an unusual breadth of experience to Nevada&rsquo;s industry, and specifically to NV Cann Labs, where she is Scientific Operations Director/COO. &ldquo;Because cannabis testing and laboratory practices are not foreign to me, my knowledge and know-how contributed to NV Cann Labs being the only lab in the State of Nevada to pass all of its proficiency testings on the first attempt. I am excited to share with cultivators and production kitchens to help them better craft their products.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Along with experience, Perkins also brings a new level of customer service to the clients of NV Cann Labs. &ldquo;I may be a laboratory scientist, but I enjoy educating others about my science. I work with our clients and help them get to where they need to be, and I can assist my client regardless of whether issues arise with the plant, concentrates, edibles, etc. because I have extensive experience in every aspect of cannabis. I&rsquo;ve worked hand in hand with all the owners of the dispensaries in Arizona -- from how to rearrange their grow rooms to get a consistent plant, how to then concentrate it, and how to then decarboxylate it to have a desired potency and then eventually put it into an edible form,&rdquo; detailed Perkins. </span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;If someone brings me in a concentrate sample and they think it should be at 75% THC, and it&rsquo;s only at 50%, I am going to go back to the producer and suggest we take a step back and go over his process. The bottom line is I want my clients to have the best products. I&rsquo;m going to do everything in my power to help grow and develop desired products, in an ethical manner.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span >Perkins also has goals beyond the laboratory setting. She wants to increase the quality of products and processes throughout the industry. &ldquo;Nevada intentionally has the strictest industry -- we watched and noted the market, business, and consumer issues, etc., with other states. I am excited for the state audits, as they become more defined, to reflect the standards the state sought enforce, to not only ensure safe products for consumers, but also to uphold ethical operations and eliminate and decrease risks and liabilities for the marijuana entity owners.</span></p>
<p><span >&ldquo;In the meantime, NV Cann is already practicing and anticipating heightened scientific practices. For instance, the mandated ISO certification will not be standard because I don&rsquo;t think ISO certification doesn&rsquo;t go far enough. I run NV Cann with a focus on best scientific practices and methods, and ISO certification is a very surface level certification that doesn&rsquo;t really dive into a standardization that is needed for our quality control and calibrations. I am really trying to take this to a whole new level.&rdquo;</span></p>

		<title>The weight  is over...or is it?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Richard S. Gubbe</h4>
</br>
<p>Wanna lose some weight? Get some cookies.</p>
<p>Huh? Get some weight-loss cookies.</p>
<p>Weight-loss cookies suck!</p>
<p>No, not the Oprah kind, the California variety. Eat &lsquo;em, vape &lsquo;em or smoke &lsquo;em.</p>
<p>The latest weight loss craze has cannabis smokers ingesting strains that can block receptors from getting the munchies caused by the psycho-activity of THC. These strains have higher-than-normal levels of THC-V, a psychoactive cannabinoid, and/or humulene, the terpene with a matching profile of caryophyllene.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The strain that best fits the profile for weight loss is none other than Girl Scout Cookies with both key ingredients. Trust us, the irony isn&rsquo;t lost here.</p>
<p>When someone overweight walks into a dispensary in 2017 in search of cookies, it isn&rsquo;t sugar they&rsquo;re after. Girl Scout Cookies, among other strains, has two fabled weight-loss aids. Is it the humulene or the THC-V they seek? Both, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>The Cookie Stampede</strong></p>
<p>A decade ago, Dr. Oz touted Pu&rsquo;er tea as a weight loss aid and Teavana ran out of their highest quality tea nationwide in a couple days after being bull-rushed by usually nonviolent women. Pu&rsquo;er comes from plants in the highest regions of China and contains a heavy amount of caffeine compared to white teas. Pu&rsquo;er has never been proven to be a strong weight loss candidate or it wouldn&rsquo;t have gone the way of the dinosaur &ndash; to the boneyard of obscurity like hundreds of fads before it. Why? The caffeine may have been the weight-loss stimulant.</p>
<p>Wait until the secret of Girl Scout Cookies hits the airwaves. Will there be lines after this article?</p>
<p>Girl Scout Cookies has both a healthy supply of THC-V and the terpene humulene. If humulene leads to weight loss, and THC-V claims the same, then both in the same cannabis strain is the bomb. Girl Scout Cookies (GSC) and its many spinoffs originates from California. Durban Poison, known for high amounts of THC-V, has an African heritage.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THC-V, Please</strong></p>
<p>For more than three years, THC-V has been touted as a possible weight-loss proponent and yet no products have appeared. While terpenes can be imported into the extraction room and added to vape pens and edibles, THC-V is a psychoactive cannabinoid that only can be extracted from cannabis and hemp. Because of the same reasons as THC, THC-V faces legal handcuffs at both state and federal levels. Not only is it illegal, THC-V is not cost-effective to process in large amounts. In cannabis profiles, the percentage of THC-V is less than one percent while its counterpart THC can reach or exceed 30 percent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relationship between THC and THC-V is obvious in the effects as well. Although both cannabinoids affect the same receptors, they do so in a different manner. THC-V is actually an antagonist for receptors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>THC-V is similar to THC in molecular structure but has a higher boiling point of 428&deg;F (220&deg;C). It can intensify the euphoria of the high, but with only about half the duration. THC-V is energetic, which could explain the energy gained from citrus strains. These strains should be avoided for those treating appetite loss or anorexia.</p>
<p>It has not been proven that THC-V may help with diabetes with no credible research to date. A future research question should be to study whether THC-V has the ability to regulate blood sugar levels and reduce insulin resistance. That study would have to take place in Canada or Israel because psychoactive compounds can&rsquo;t be studied in the United States outside of a government grant.</p>
<p>THC-V is most abundant in sativas, particularly landrace strains from Africa with Durban Poison being one of the more common high-THC-V strains.</p>
<p><strong>Oh, Humulene!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;Humulene is one of the components of the essential oil from the flowering cone of the hops plant, humulus lupulus, from which it derives its name. Humulene gives many beers their &ldquo;hoppy&rdquo; aroma. Noble hop varieties have been found to have higher levels of humulene, while other bitter hop varieties contain low levels.</p>
<p>Humulene has been found in many aromatic plants on all continents, often together with its isomer -- caryophyllene. Humulene emitters in the atmosphere include pine trees, orange orchards, and tobacco and sunflower fields. Humulene is also found in Salvia officinalis, common sage and culinary sage. Caryophyllene has the characteristic aroma of cannabis sativa and is a known anti-inflammatory and carcinogen fighter.</p>
<p>Strains known to test high in humulene include White Widow, Headband, Pink Kush, Sour Diesel, and Skywalker OG. Strains exhibiting heightened levels of caryophyllene include OG Kush, Bubba Kush, Chemdawg, Skywalker OG, and Sour Diesel.</p>
<p><strong>THINK PINK</strong></p>
<p>Local grower Don Decatur of City Trees has turned mixologist. He sees a shift in cannabis demographics and is aiming products at women in a male-dominated consumer base.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been seeing a lot of excitement with women and new products,&rdquo; Decatur told <em>elevate</em>. He developed a 200-milligram disposable vape pen that is &ldquo;like a slim cigarette and we offer it in a pink. Women who are recreational smokers are more curious. We want to appeal to them in a classy way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s not the only one mixing things up in Nevada, many medical marijuana establishments are mixing and matching terpenes and cannabinoids to create their own concoctions.</p>
<p>Decatur also has created terpene-only drinks called Energize, Bliss, Relax and Pain, each with terpenes matching the objective. His next offering? Humulene in a weight-loss drink, of course.</p>
<p><strong>FAD OR RAD?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><em>elevate</em> wants answers. Will there be lines at the cookie counter? Will smoking or vaping GSC or Durban Poison drop some needed pounds or is this merely the latest in a sad line of fads, lies and health risks?</p>
<p>The synergistic qualities of strains are what make cannabis so dynamic. THC-V and humulene may be key ingredients to help lose weight. But the entourage effect may be in play again with the interaction of certain percentages of cannabinoids and terpenes creating the right absorption to control the desire to eat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless they come out with thin mints&hellip;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kristen Etz can remember planting flower bulbs with her grandmother at the tender age of eight. The experience took root and Etz began nurturing a passion for growing that stands to this day. &ldquo;In high school, I had a little light in my bedroom where I would grow house plants underneath it. I was always digging up my back yard and planting flower and vegetables,&rdquo; recalls Etz, who joined Nevada Organic Remedies (NOR) in June as Cultivation and Compliance Manager and is preparing for her first harvest at the facility next month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Richmond, Virginia native made her way to Nevada in 2015 after a pitstop in Colorado. &ldquo;When I moved to Colorado I was just looking for some sort of agricultural job and there were tons of jobs in the cannabis industry and I got my foot in the door in one of the cannabis companies as an entry-level grower,&rdquo; relays Etz, 28, who graduated from James Madison University with a degree in Environmental Science in 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I studied a lot of environmental issues and the one thing that I figured I could start with was helping to change the world of agriculture,&rdquo; Etz explains. &ldquo;In the last year or so I started focusing on sustainable agriculture. Ideally, I wanted to start working on small farms, figure out what was going on and then go into policy. Now I like the hands-on of growing and figuring out the most efficient methods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Etz also saw &ldquo;the opportunities right away. There&rsquo;s a lot in the industry if you show you are passionate towards cannabis and you are a hard worker it&rsquo;s pretty easy to move up, there&rsquo;s a lot of vertical movement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those opportunities led Etz to move further west with her boyfriend two years ago. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a whirlwind since we moved out to Las Vegas. Starting a facility off the ground is a lot more challenging that I had imagined. On a commercial level, it&rsquo;s not only about taking care of plants, you have to know HVAC, you have to know plumbing, talk to contractors, basically all of the planning maintenance can be overwhelming,&rdquo; explains Etz, who continues, &ldquo;a lot of people think they can build the building, bring in plants, and it will grow. To get the facility dialed in people spend a lot on mistakes. Judging on what I have seen out here it&rsquo;s mainly people guessing where the market would be and underestimating the time, the money, and the talent that it takes to start one of these operations.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joining NOR three months ago, Etz along with her boyfriend, Michael Cooper, who is NOR&rsquo;s Director of Cultivation, were brought in to revamp the cultivation which accommodates 4,000 to 5,000 plants and has a staff of 12 (four growers and eight trimmers). &ldquo;The grow I work at now, we basically redid the whole thing. We revamped 15,000 square feet, cut down a lot of plants, put up walls, did a deep clean... it wasn&rsquo;t designed to be grower-friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although only in the cannabis industry for the last four years but working in cultivations as large as 40,000 square feet, Etz understands what it takes to have a successful grow. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gotta be designed and built correctly, organization and cleanliness are big ones. Efficiency is one of the biggest, I go in a lot of grows with 20 growers and you could do the same thing with five. Having the right people in the right places is key,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cultivating also takes a lot of passion and a lot of patience, notes Etz, who believes being female gives her <br />a different viewpoint on the growing process. &ldquo;I bring a lot more of the organization behind the processes. I do a lot of the scheduling, forecasting of what we are going to be growing in the next year, how many lbs. we are going to <br />pull out of a harvest, a lot of spreadsheets. I feel like <br />it&rsquo;s definitely a different perspective that I can bring to <br />the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As November nears and the cultivation team at NOR prepares for its first harvest which will yield 45 lbs., Etz says she&rsquo;s excited. &ldquo;The recent renovations will have a direct impact on the end product. We have turned NOR into a powerhouse not only for the yields we will produce, but the highest quality Las Vegas has seen. No stone was left unturned to ensure patients and retail customers receive the quality and consistency they deserve. Like every other living being, plants are sensitive to the energy surrounding them. If they are loved and taken care of throughout their cycle, that will shine through in the finished product.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>SOUTH DAKOTA</h2>South Dakota has 30 days left to collect the remaining signatures needed to place marijuana initiative measures on the 2018 ballot. Two petitions are currently being circulated — one seeks to legalize marijuana for medical uses and the other to legalize certain amounts of marijuana for adult use and to regulate and tax marijuana businesses. Signatures are tied to the number of votes cast in the state’s most recent gubernatorial election, so each petition needs at least 13,871 signatures by November 2017 to make it on the November 2018 ballot.

<h2>MINNESOTA</h2>
Post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) was added to Minnesota’s medical cannabis program. Patients suffering from this condition have enrolled in the program, and, as of August 1, had access to medical cannabis. Every year, the Minnesota Office of Medical Cannabis accepts petitions to add new conditions. This year’s petitions were included for nausea, Alzheimer’s, and autism. Before deciding whether to add any conditions, a review panel will hold a public hearing. While Minnesota has a comprehensive medical marijuana program, one of the most significant flaws in the program is that patients are not permitted to consume whole plant (flower) cannabis.

<h2>TENNESSEE</h2>
House Speaker Beth Harwell and Lieutenant Governor Randy McNally formed a committee to study the potential impacts of legalizing medical marijuana in Tennessee. Speaker Harwell has recently said she is “open” to considering a law allowing medical marijuana in Tennessee and has launched a House task force to fight the state’s ongoing opioid crisis. A 2014 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that states with medical marijuana laws are associated with a significant reduction in mortality from opioid abuse; these states saw a 25% reduction in opioid overdose deaths, compared to states without such laws.

<h2>NEW HAMPSHIRE</h2>
In July, Governor Chris Sununu signed HB 640 making New Hampshire the 22nd state, and the final New England state, to decriminalize marijuana possession. House Bill 640 eliminates criminal penalties for the possession of up to 3/4 of an ounce of cannabis and/or up to five grams of hashish for those age 18 or older. Under the new law, first-time offenders will receive a civil violation punishable by a $100 fine. Presently, first-time marijuana possession is punishable by up to one year in prison, a potential $2,000 fine, and a criminal record. New Hampshire is the only New England state that presently treats minor possession offenses as a criminal offense.

<h2>DELAWARE</h2>
In mid-July, Governor John Carney signed SB 24 into law. Now, patients in Delaware suffering from PTSD will no longer need to visit a psychiatrist to obtain a certification for medical cannabis. They can instead get their certifications signed by any physician. The change to the program takes effect immediately. The bill — known as the Bravery Bill — was sponsored by Senator Margaret Rose Henry, who is also sponsoring Delaware’s adult use cannabis bill, HB 110. An earlier version of SB 24 would have also added anxiety disorders to the program, but that language was removed from the final bill.

<p><span >I slowly opened my eyes and tried to piece together the events of the last couple of hours. Where was I? What happened? Did I lose my vape pen? In the distance, I made out the silhouette of a beautiful woman. I squinted and noticed a strange
 tattoo on her shoulder before she vanished into thin air. </span></p>

<p><span >Suddenly the phone rang. I snapped out of it and realized I was in a villa at the Bellagio.  
“Good morning, Octokushy. This is your wakeup call.”
Octokushy? I scratched my head...had I stumbled upon the mythical craps hustler-turned-ganjapreneur and let her slip through my fingers?
</span></p>

<p><em>James,</br>
XXX by Virtue is my strain and shooting dice is my game. This Jane West bong is elegant and smooth, take a few rips and get on the move. </br>

<p><span >The scent of something dank led me to the living room. Laying on the coffee table I found three things: some gorgeous nugs, a majestic blue vase, and a note.</span></p>

<p><span >The note was sealed with a kiss and the sketch of a rose. Where had I seen this rose before? 
No time to worry about that now as those sticky XXX nugs were calling my name. I examined the bong that I had mistaken for a vase. Its sleek and strong body reminded me of the Fabergé egg I had picked up at an auction earlier this week. Load, rip, clear, repeat. I was impressed with the smooth and flavorful hits and how easily the bowl cashed and chamber cleared. I could see why this was Octokushy’s piece of choice.  
</span></p>

<p><span >I poked around the suite to learn more about my mystery girl. A-ha! She thought she could pull a fast one on old 00710 but she made a rookie mistake and left her cosmetics case on the bathroom counter.  </span></p>

<p><span >I unzipped it and examined the inventory: lipstick…powder compact…cotton swabs...weed grinder...nothing out of the ordinary. Wait a minute, what's a weed grinder doing in a makeup case? On closer inspection, I realized that the lipstick was actually a limited edition Badwoods Micro G-Pen, the compact turned into a stashbox, and the swabs were infused with isopropyl alcohol for on-the-go tool cleaning. Everything was marked with her signature rose too…nice touch, Octokushy. I loaded the G-Pen with some Tangilope Shatter by MatrixNV and took a massive rip. Damn…I was in love. </span></p>

<p><span >My mind was bouncing like a circus. Had I met the Bong girl of my dreams? Determined to find her, I went back to the living room for an inspirational toke from the Jane West bong and to devise a plan. Nothing would stop me…except for maybe this room service menu. Does that say grilled cheese with tater tots stuffed inside the bread?</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Beth Schwartz Photography by Marcello Rostagni</h4>
</br>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to be part of the revolution and to be along for the ride as things evolve,&rdquo; offers professional cyclist Teal Stetson-Lee, 31, who is so serious about her subject matter she doesn&rsquo;t even notice her pun.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subject is cannabis and Stetson-Lee is talking about her role as a cannabis athlete ambassador for Northern Nevada&rsquo;s Kynd Cannabis Company. Although she uses cannabis products in her post-recovery training as a professional mountain biker and cyclocross racer, it is more about the education factor for the 2016 Sea Otter Classic winner and 2013 Super D National Champion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The use of the product is valuable for athletes and I would stand behind that 100 percent, but when it comes to parents talking to their kids, the information piece is my main platform &ndash; the education. If this helps them to have conversations with their kids and learn more about cannabis than I am doing my job,&rdquo; explains Stetson-Lee. &ldquo;The dissemination of information is the most important piece to me not necessarily the actual use of the product.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although relatively new to the topic, Stetson-Lee has a lot of enthusiasm for advancing the conversation surrounding cannabis. &ldquo;I feel like there&rsquo;s infinite potential with it and it seems to be resonating well with people so I have been kind of throwing myself into the deep end as an experiment to see how it goes over.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>More and more professional athletes are starting to become public about their cannabis use especially former NFL players. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a fascinating aspect of the whole CBD/cannabis use in the sports world. I think it&rsquo;s super awesome that these guys are coming out and being advocates for it and are releasing their own lines and starting a dialogue,&rdquo; Stetson-Lee says of NFL players such as Kyle Turley, Eugene Monroe, and Jake Plummer, who advocate for cannabis. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting because many of them were never willing to do that during the course of their careers because that was way too risky&nbsp; and that was something that I weighed pretty carefully. But now I feel really proud of it -- that in the heart of my career I took the risk to go down that controversial avenue. That&rsquo;s&nbsp;</p>
<p>the one valuable piece of the controversy is that it is stirring up some much-needed dialogue and hopefully it&rsquo;s starting to dispel some of the mythology around cannabis use, I am extremely passionate about that. I love having conversations with people to try and help correct some of the misinformation that&rsquo;s been circulating for so long.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That enthusiasm has led Stetson-Teal to her own activism. &ldquo;I have been initiating conversations with the powers that be in the International Cycling Association, USA Cycling, and I am hoping to connect with USADA (United States Anti-Doping Agency) and WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency) to have some conversations with them. Just because I want to have that dialogue opened up and I want to know why this is something that has been a policy for so long and how are they evolving with the changing climate. That&rsquo;s something I am really interested in taking on,&rdquo; she explains.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, with mountain biking season having ended in August and cyclocross season ramping up with the first big race in September in Sacramento, the Reno resident is on a pretty strict training regimen that involves riding five or six days out of the week. Training varies from a group road ride to a long mountain bike ride in high country to doing shorter rides with intervals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of that training requires that Stetson-Lee be able to recover quickly post-workout, which is where cannabidiol (CBD) has entered her regimen. &ldquo;CBD, specifically, has been a huge focus for me and a learning curve,&rdquo; she relays, noting in the past she used arnica oil to treat sore muscles, injuries, sprains, and bruises. &ldquo;This year I was turned onto anti-inflammatory CBD salves by Kynd Cannabis Company which are equally, if not more, effective for a lot of those same treatments. After they approached me about being part of their athlete ambassador program, I started learning a lot about their products at that point because I was really intrigued.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Growing up in the small mountain town of Durango, Colorado, Stetson-Teal had used cannabis products recreationally on occasion but hadn&rsquo;t been introduced to it on the medicinal side especially with regard to how it could benefit an athlete. She started using Kynd&rsquo;s CBD tincture and salve post-workout to &ldquo;recover and heal quicker, stay fresher, and help my body relax more so I sleep better, which is huge.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although CBD is mainly what she has been using, citing CBD&rsquo;s anti-inflammatory properties as a benefit for her muscle and injury recovery, Stetson-Lee has also been experimenting with THC.&nbsp; &ldquo;A lot of the CBD products can be more effective when they are paired with a small amount of THC because of the entourage effect. I have experimented with different products that have THC in them. I have some flexibility to do that because with my enduro mountain bike season I am not drug tested and the drug testing is specifically for THC. Enduro is a new enough mountain bike discipline that it doesn&rsquo;t have that additional regulation involved with it, but cyclocross is a more formal cycling discipline and so there is a whole governing body and they do drug testing so I won&rsquo;t be able to use THC products during my cyclocross season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aside from that, I think using some of the products with the combined THC and CBD offers a relaxation component which is really paramount, especially for athletes who can be so driven and so psychologically anxious all the time. Having something that helps to calm them down physically and mentally, and helps them turn off and get more rest is really important. Recovery is so much more important than actually training in the long-run.&rdquo; Especially after an injury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, I get injured fairly frequently in my sport so it&rsquo;s been a lifesaver,&rdquo; explains Stetson-Lee of CBD. &ldquo;I travel with it and it&rsquo;s something I have been able to share with other athletes. It&rsquo;s kind of a godsend product.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having raced professionally for the last eight years, Stetson-Lee has suffered her share of injuries and crashes. The most epic happened in June 2012 during a cross-country race. She was in the lead group and had just finished one lap of the course when she rode over a water bar and her front wheel fell off causing her to fly over the bar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened so quickly, I had no reaction time whatsoever. In fact, I don&rsquo;t even have a memory of it happening. I just remember riding with my group and I woke up in the hospital. I landed on my face and I didn&rsquo;t have any time to put my hands out and break the fall so I was knocked out instantly on impact and woke up in the hospital. My face was totally mangled and I had a pretty severe concussion. I don&rsquo;t remember the month of June actually from that year,&rdquo; recalls Stetson-Lee. &ldquo;That was my first introduction to dealing with a significant head trauma and what that healing process looked like and how weird it is go through that as you are trying to come back to being yourself again. I was off the bike for a month and a half.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a huge crash in my career and changed my way of thinking about how I take care of my body. My big epiphany from that crash was that athletes can be a little crazy, to put it lightly, but there ends up with this piece of being an athlete, an athlete archetype, who is really driven to the point where you override some of your body&rsquo;s messages and needs. There&rsquo;s a time when it&rsquo;s good to push and there&rsquo;s a time when it&rsquo;s really important to reign it back and listen to what your body is telling you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, my healing process really put me in tune with that on a different level. I had been able to override a lot of my body&rsquo;s messaging for a long time through my training which in some ways allowed me to get to where I have as a professional athlete. But going through this process taught me to take more rest and take more time and be more patient with what my body needed. That&rsquo;s something I have taken with me even after I fully recovered and continued through my career all the way up to this point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon deeper reflection of her concussion and injury in 2012, Stetson-Lee wishes she had known about CBD then. &ldquo;It would have been amazing to have those products at that time. All the studies being done right now as far as CBD and brain trauma is pretty astounding. That would be my first go-to and my first recommendation for anybody who has any kind of head trauma,&rdquo; she concludes. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting to see cannabis being put into the limelight in that respect and I think it&rsquo;s helping to create some positive education around it more rapidly.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>By Derek J. Connor Esq., Connor & Connor PLLC</h3>
<p>2017 has brought a lot of changes to the cannabis industry in Nevada. With the continued growth of the medical program and the legalization of adult use, the focus has now shifted to resolving any issues that have arisen while regulating this new industry. One issue that clients (and potential clients) of my law practice have been struggling with is the restriction on the public consumption of cannabis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevada state law currently prohibits using marijuana in a &ldquo;public place,&rdquo; which most local jurisdictions have interpreted as including any place open to the public, including private clubs and lounges. Due to this interpretation, local governments have not been able to issue any business licenses to cannabis friendly establishments. Therefore, the only place that customers have been able to consume cannabis products has been in a private residence. During the legislative session in the spring, a bill that would have permitted local governments to issue licenses to cannabis friendly businesses failed to pass. Additionally, the Nevada gaming industry has unequivocally banned the use of cannabis on gaming properties, including hotels attached to casinos. Given Nevada&rsquo;s huge tourism industry, the lack of a place for tourists to consume legally purchased cannabis products is a major concern for visitors to our state; they can&rsquo;t smoke outside and they can&rsquo;t smoke in their hotels which often forces them to break the law to use the products they legally bought. Fortunately, there seems to be a potential resolution to this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An opinion recently released by the Nevada Legislative Counsel Bureau stated that businesses &ldquo;may establish and operate a lounge or other facility or special event&rdquo; where patrons can use marijuana &ldquo;in compliance with state law.&rdquo; The Counsel&rsquo;s opinion, dated September 10, stressed the law&rsquo;s language restricting marijuana usage in public places, but ultimately determined that as long as the busine</p>
<p>sses remain restricted (i.e. not open to the public) to persons over the age of 21 and not exposed to public view, cannabis lounges are not contrary to state law and may be allowable. This means that businesses such as cafes, lounges, or even yoga studios, and special events such as festivals, conferences, and concerts may soon open their doors to marijuana consumption on their grounds. Therefore, both locals and visitors may soon be able to enjoy smoking cannabis in a social atmosphere outside of their home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the opinion emphasizes the discretion local governments will have over the issue. The Counsel stated counties and towns &ldquo;may impose restrictions and otherwise regulate such businesses so long as the regulations or other restrictions do not violate state law.&rdquo; This means that localities can restrict permits, impose taxes, and heavily regulate the industry if they so choose. Areas of the Las Vegas Valley (such as Henderson) will likely show concern over the location and advertisements of pot lounges, especially near schools, public parks and other locations likely to be viewed by children.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Governor Sandoval also stated his concerns about licensing cannabis lounges, as reported by Jenny Kane in a September 13th <em>Reno Gazette-Journal</em> article. "I am concerned with these establishments popping up piecemeal throughout the state with differing rules and regulatory structure," Sandoval said. "I also question why legislation was proposed during the 2017 legislative session if legal authority already existed. Since passage of the initiative, I have called for Nevada&rsquo;s regulatory structure to be responsible, restricted, and respected."</p>
<p>The Governor&rsquo;s concerns seem to be based on the possibility that certain local governments may fail to strictly regulate lounges and thereby draw the ire of federal law enforcement. To the Governor&rsquo;s credit, one of the provisions of the infamous Cole Memo is that states and local governments should implement strict regulatory schemes to prevent negative consequences, such as providing minors access to cannabis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Local governments are expected to meet soon to iron out the details, but it may be some time before a licensed cannabis lounge opens for business. Nevertheless, this is a huge step for the cannabis industry in Nevada. Aside from the obvious consumer benefits, the opportunity for new businesses cannot be understated. New local laws could entice Nevadans to form hundreds of new businesses catering to marijuana consumption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although it remains to be seen what type of licensing requirements will be put in place by local jurisdictions, state and local governments have a long history of successfully regulating so-called &ldquo;vice industries&rdquo; and I fully expect that they will be successful here as well.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Guy Bertuzzi I Photography by Doren Malik, @dorenmalik</h4>
<br>
<p>Creating a strain in ode to <em>elevate</em> has just been one more highlight of starting this magazine more than two years ago. <br />When we decided to partner with Virtue Las Vegas to breed a strain and name it for <em>elevate</em> earlier this year, I was like a fat kid in a candy store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We collaborated with Virtue Las Vegas to develop an indica-dominant hybrid strain. I envisioned a strain that would aid users with both sleep and pain management. Virtue did not disappoint and hit a homerun delivering on my vision. Yet as I talk to various people who have used it, the results have been varied and the strain seemingly effects everyone differently. It helps some people sleep, but others have said it resulted in a great euphoric feeling that gave them the energy to get off the couch and get things on their to-do list crossed off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To celebrate elevate&rsquo;s release into the market, instead of doing a typical review, we decided to invite different people, both in and out of the industry, to share their thoughts on the strain. Not surprisingly after trying elevate, several of our reviewers told us it is one of their favorite strains in the marketplace. I would like to take credit for it, but David Holmes and his team at Virtue deserve all the kudos. Currently, elevate the strain is available at Nevada Medical Marijuana in Henderson and The Apothecarium near Summerlin. Shoot us an email if you try it and let us know what you think.</p>
<h3>from elevate&rsquo;s own reviewer</h3>
<p>A great flavor profile with the strong effects of both a head and body high are the exuberant characteristics that define the strain named for <em>elevate NV</em> magazine and created by Virtue. An &ldquo;elevator&rdquo; in every sense of the word&mdash;it will put you in a state of complete and utter bliss&mdash;elevate blends the very best of three excellent strains. Developed and sourced by Clade9, elevate&rsquo;s proprietary bud has the superb genetics of Snake Eyes, Ghost OG, and Haze. Overall, when creating a signature strain, Virtue&rsquo;s cultivator David Holmes says he looks for &ldquo;terpene profile, yield and aesthetic as the main properties [when] breeding boutique flowers.&rdquo; Its development took around two years, Holmes says, with most of the time dedicated to finding select males. It tests low-to-mid max THC and mid-to-high 20s on total cannabinoids. &ldquo;We have high hopes that this will be a popular variety,&rdquo; says Holmes. &ldquo;The original name of the strain was Blakeout because it knocked out our flower manager Blake.&rdquo; This high has it all, hitting the head and body with relaxation and euphoria as well as sublime virtues that provide pain relief and a reprieve from insomnia. After a couple of puffs, expect to fall away into dreamland with the possibility of waking up to an appetite that must be satiated immediately.</p>

<h3>from the dispensary&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Virtue has added another star to their diverse and unique library of genetics currently being supplied to Nevada&rsquo;s medical and recreational markets. Known for strains such as Snake Eyes OG and Diamond Dust, this new edition, elevate, is sure to emerge as a new fan favorite. elevate showcases vibrant colors ranging from light and dark purple to varying shades of green and looks as if she was dipped in a THC crystalline bath prior to packaging. This flower is dense yet sticky and delivers aroma profiles of candy, citrus, pine, and a slight hint of spice. Upon consumption, this flower packs a sweet and piney punch making one reluctant to share. As you draw in, the hit is smooth and the flower ashes white confirming what we already know, Virtue treated this girl with the same love and respect as the rest of their family. Upon take off, elevate stays true to her name -- enhancing one&rsquo;s mood while providing an increased sense of alertness and focus. This intense liftoff can be accredited to her most prominent terpenes: limonene and pinene. As one settles in and surrenders to this strain, two more terpenes take effect: myrcene and linalool. These terpenes assert themselves by taking away any anxiety and providing a calming sensation. At the height of your experience, these four terpenes and a 21 percent THC concentration combine to create an entourage effect or high that leaves one in a calm, euphoric and explorative state of mind.</p>

<h3>from the lab</h3>
<p>The first thing I noticed after popping the top of my pre-roll tube of the new elevate strain from Virtue was the unmistakably sour scent that tingles and almost burns my nostrils. After a second deep inhale I also detect sweet musky tones that remind me of earth and berries. This smells like a strain with some OG lineage but has other unique fragrances that put it above and beyond your average OG. I lit the joint and took a long drag. The smoke is heavy but very smooth on my throat. After puffing and passing a couple times, the flavor really sets in. There is a zesty, sour citrus flavor in the forefront and on the back of the hit rich notes of chocolate and berries ring in. This flower stayed smooth and tasty all the way until the last hit of this pre-roll. As soon as I put out the roach, I feel intense relaxation and euphoria in my body. I can feel the tension from the day leaving my muscles as I sit back and let the high settle in. I am surprisingly clear headed and have almost no cottonmouth. This is a fantastic strain that I would recommend to those looking to relieve pain but don&rsquo;t want to be too stoney or couch locked. This strain packs a powerful punch that is sure to have you elevated. Gotta give props to the Virtue cultivation crew for this one.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Oscar Hunt, Field Chemist, Ace Analytical Laboratory</strong></p>

<h3>from the dispensary</h3>
<p>Oh elevate, how I love your magical sensations. You&rsquo;re like a warm, homemade berry pie. Surrounding me with a deep fruity aroma, mixed with earthy undertones, you engulf me in sativa like qualities even though you&rsquo;re an indica-dominant strain. The smooth hit immediately calms my nerves and then slowly transitions into an indica type feeling. Most strains lean one way or the other with me, but elevate allowed me the energy to get a great workout in, as well as to create my nighttime haven when I smoked before turning my lights out and increased my dose before bed. Sleep was amazing with elevate and helped with my aches and pains throughout the entire night. All in all, elevate by Virtue is a well-rounded, top-shelf flower that I highly recommend. It gives you the best of both worlds by creating an enlightened high, followed by a deep relax. This will be a highly sought-after strain among the medicinal patients for the high terpene profile, and strong flower, as well as a favorite among recreational connoisseurs. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>from a reader</h3>
<p>The first thing about this bud that really jumps out at you is the gorgeous purple hues that are found throughout the nugs. Once you open the bag, a sweet berry-like aroma embraces your nostrils, but the deeper you inhale you can really tell how pungent this strain is. Upon closer inspection of the flower, you can see thousands of trichrome crystals covering the buds and even a few fiery orange hairs, making it aesthetically pleasing. The bud formation is fabulous as well. The nugs are dense yet still fluffy and they break down very well. It has a very potent yet smooth draw and the flavor is reminiscent of berries. From the very moment you inhale the smoke, you can feel your head start swimming in the way that only really good chronic makes you feel. That feeling only intensifies the longer you hold in the smoke and upon exhale you are once again visited by that sweet, berry taste. Even for a daily smoker one or two hits is enough to make you easily sidetracked and a whole bowl to yourself is more than enough to get the job done. Although it is an indica-dominant strain it doesn&rsquo;t put you to sleep like one might expect, which makes it suitable for both daytime and nighttime use. The effect is also long-lasting, making it good for someone who likes to be stoned during their daily errands or relax at the end of a long day. Overall an unforgettable strain and one of the very best I have had the pleasure of smoking. Check out my Instagram @blazin_in_the_505 for pictures of this strain and other frosty nugs. #blazeit #gethigh #staylifted&nbsp;</p>

<h3>from the dispensary&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Although Virtue&rsquo;s elevate strain is an indica- dominant hybrid, for me, it was pretty well balanced. It started off with sativa effects and then gently eased into the indica body high, stoned sensation. This strain had me feeling happy, focused, euphoric and very giggly at first. But, for me, the best part were the effects of the indica side. It left me totally relaxed, even floaty at times, famished and a little drowsy, but most of all it alleviated all signs of pain and I felt as though I hadn&rsquo;t a care in the world. I was very impressed and quite surprised by how fast I felt the effects, how good they made me feel, and how long they lasted. I must say that it was a rather pleasurable experience for me. elevate is a great all-around strain, I can see it being beneficial to medical patients as well as giving those using it recreationally a phenomenal high. I know some people are big on taste and smell, but unfortunately I don&rsquo;t taste anything I smoke. But this strain has a great earthy, herbal smell with slight hints of something mysterious I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on. With that said, this has got to be one of my absolute favorites, I can&rsquo;t wait for it to hit shelves!</p>

<h3>from a cannabis tastemaker&nbsp;</h3>
<p><em>Young Fashioned</em> has come out of strain review retirement to check out the exclusive elevate strain from Virtue. We got our samples in pre-roll form so we can't speak on bud structure, aesthetics, and the full nose. However, upon popping open the doob tube our nostrils were greeted with a dense aromatic smell reminiscent of a sweet bubba kush. The smoke itself envelopes your palate with an intoxicating blend of sweet earthiness and deep notes of coffee. It finishes with a delicate touch of chocolate and lemony funk. The flavor seemed to stick around for a while, which we always welcome with something as terpene rich as elevate. The notable levels of caryophyllene, limonene, and linalool prove to work synergistically to provide anti-inflammatory, uplifting, and relaxing effects -- like a warm hug of cannabis bliss. This strain is a great option for patients and consumers seeking tension relief, mood elevation, and moderate pain relief. For us, we'd rate this at top-shelf, hands down.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Janz</strong><strong><em>, Young Fashioned, youngfashioned.com</em></strong></p>

<h3>from the dispensary &nbsp;</h3>
<p>This hybrid/indica strain from Virtue will strike from head to toe and send you on a high reminiscent of your first few experiences. Fruity pebble mixed in with hints of pine and jet fuel, elevate has a smell you can taste. The first puff exemplifies a smooth blend that gives you a brain rush and mellows into a nice controlled burn with a clean white ash for a perfect late-night blunt or watching football at home on a lazy Sunday afternoon. The high revolves like a wheel, constantly manipulating the body&rsquo;s senses lasting for two to three hours, a plus when it comes to the benefit of the muscle relaxation this strain provides. elevate will have you questioning your intelligence with simple tasks like going to the store but make no mistake, before you know it, you've become deep in thought questioning modern existence. The terpene profile on this flower rings true to the effect and taste with an outstanding amount of caryophyllene, linalool and limonene. Finally bag appeal on this flower is above all else, absolutely covered in trichomes, the nugs are perfectly manicured and ready to put a smile on both connoisseur and novice.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In February 2016, Governor Jerry Brown appointed Lori Ajax as the first Chief of the newly formed California Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation. Prior to her appointment, Chief Ajax served as Chief Deputy Director at the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control where she spent 22 years working her way up the ranks, starting at the investigator trainee level. Once the people of California passed recreational cannabis last November, Ajax's office became the Bureau of Cannabis Control responsible for regulating non-medical cannabis and significantly expanding Ajax's responsibilities. Ajax's office has been loaned $10 million by the state to set up a 25-person bureau that can begin issuing licenses on January 1, 2018.

<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">
It didn’t take coaxing, it was more me putting in a lot of thought before taking the job. It was just knowing how immense the challenge was going to be and just being thoughtful about it and making sure I could give the commitment I knew it was going to take. I knew it was going to be a tremendous commitment, and I just wanted to make sure I felt I was the right person for the job.

At the time I got hired, we only had the Medical Cannabis Regulation Safety Act. I was just hired to do the statewide regulatory system for medical. Then later in the year adult-use passed so it really expanded the scope of the job. So, at the time I took the job, I didn’t know that it was on the horizon and I wasn’t even sure it would fall under the bureau. Would I still take it (the job)? I probably would. I still think not knowing a lot about the cannabis industry, I probably didn’t realize how immense the job was. My eyes are wide open now. It would be a different thought process this time around but it’s hard to go back and say what you would have done.

We have done a lot of touring, and I still do tours because each time what I am looking at, compared to what I was looking at a year-and-a-half-ago, is from a different lens. When I was new at the job and didn’t know a lot, I was still in awe, and like, ‘wow, this is all here.’ Now that we have our draft medical regs out there I am looking at it with a different eye. I am looking at it from the viewpoint of how do our regulations fit in here? I think it’s still important for us at the Bureau to continue seeing cannabis operations and how they are operating and how that fits in with the regs that we are going to be developing.

<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

That’s one nice thing, we get to look at what some of the other states have gone through. You look at how the edibles were rolled out in Colorado and how our regulations could be stricter from the start as they relate to the edible market or even consumer safety campaigns about how to use edibles. That’s very valuable to us. You look at testing laboratories in California -- do we have enough testing labs and what did the other states go through and how did they roll that out. Different states did it differently, some of them rolled it out incrementally. We look at how everyone is dealing with some of the other issues. You are just trying to glean as much information as you can from them. Like how they are dealing with their track and trace systems. It’s not just one thing, you want to learn as much as you can. Obviously, our laws are different but there’s a lot of takeaways.

Our statutes our different, we are dealing with a cannabis industry that’s been operating in California for a couple of decades and, geographically, we are so large. The best way to say it is we are not emulating anything exactly but we are taking bits and pieces from all the different states and looking at them and seeing how it fits into the California market. It’s taking those pieces that work for us, whether it be with how they deal with the retailers, to what they are doing with their lab testing. I think we are looking at everything and seeing how it fits in our market and tweaking it based on our situation and statutes.

What has been the biggest difference between regulating alcohol and cannabis?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I always turn to the fact that alcohol is not federally illegal and that’s easy to say when you first walk in. Then you realize how much that you take for granted as far as what the federal government regulates at their level: they do most of the testing, product recipes, and all the label approval is handled at the federal level. All of that falls on the state now because there is nobody doing that so that really increases the state’s responsibilities -- regulating and making sure it’s safe for consumers. There are all sorts of things when it comes to everything from worker safety to pesticides -- all of that is the responsibility of the state. It’s no little thing.

<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

When I came into this, I was open to anything. I was there just to learn and soak it in. I actually think that helped me -- not coming from cannabis. Not necessarily having any experience in any part of the industry, I think that was helpful to be very objective and not have any opinions on it at all. I came from a place where I understood regulations and how to regulate a product. It was nice to bring what really works for us as an alcohol regulator and maybe some things that didn’t quite work as well. I think it’s nice to be able to have the perspective of having that regulatory experience too. I was a blank slate at the beginning and I felt like ‘wow, I don’t know anything’ but I think it really was the best way to come in. But I don’t think I knew that at the time. It was a steep learning curve. There’s so much I didn’t know and I knew I had to learn it quickly.

What is the most frustrating thing about the cannabis industry?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Not necessarily the industry itself, but I think right now what’s frustrating everybody, including you folks over there, is probably the banking part of it. It’s tough as a state to come up with a solution that’s going to work for the state, for the regulators, for the industry. I think probably the hardest part is the people you are licensing are going to be mainly dealing in cash and having to regulate that and not being able to really find a long-term solution. That’s a tough one because that’s not really in our control. Being federally illegal really does hamper the states a lot. It’s tough for a workaround. It’s a little tougher here because the state’s so big. Where we are able to take cash and where people have to travel becomes magnified when we have such a geographically large state. Then it’s a public safety issue and, of course, we would like to minimize that.

Does cannabis’ status of being federally illegal seem to help your process or frustrate it? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I will say this, we do have some federal guidelines still out there with the Cole Memo. We are making sure as we set up our regulatory system that we are trying to abide by all of that. Obviously because it’s illegal, they don’t have a lot of federal regulations in place. I do think it makes it challenging. You aren’t partnering with the federal government. We don’t know what’s going to happen. You have an industry with every right to be worried about getting licensed with the state and what’s going to happen if the federal government were to come in. I think that is always going to make it a challenge for us at the state level. The success of our program depends on getting these folks in the regulated market. You want them to have confidence that they can come into the regulated market and not suffer for that. We need to get them in the regulated market and keep them there and that causes worry for folks.

With January 1st looming, what do you think will be your biggest obstacle?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Our biggest consideration is that we have so many people out there already operating and have been operating and don’t want them all to come to a screeching halt on January 1st. Some of them are operating legally through their local jurisdiction. In the state of California, you have to have local approval before we can even give you a state license so you don’t want all that to come to a screeching halt. You want people to be able to continue operating so that means we have to issue licenses so we are looking at issuing temporary licenses. We have that in our statute, SB 94, that was just passed in late June. It repealed the Medical Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act and it’s amended Prop. 64 which gives us the ability to issue temporary licenses and let them operate for four months to give us time to vet their permanent license application.

What’s going to be the most critical component for the state?

<div id="collapseEleven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

For us, it’s having our IT system in place to accept those applications before January 1st of 2018 and vet them for the temporary license and make sure they have local approval and have licenses across the state and across the supply chain. There’s going to be bumps but we will need to keep things in transition. We don’t want to put people in an immediate disadvantage on January 2nd so nobody has a license so nobody can sell, distribute or any of that. That’s a challenge in this big state. We are really being very strategic by accepting applications ahead of time. So, we know where people are and whose applying, we can make sure we have enough testing labs across the state. You want the product to go through the supply chain and get to the retail market so there’s product there. You don’t want your patients not to have cannabis that they can legally obtain. That’s the challenge for this state.

When will the licensing process begin?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwelve" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

We are still finalizing our regulations so we haven’t opened up any licensing yet, it will likely happen in early December. We are also having to do an environmental impact study that we are finishing up and that will have to be completed before our regulations can be finalized. Since the new law passed at the end of June we can’t go through the regular rulemaking process. As far as the testing labs, we have some really strict requirements such as they will have to be ISO-certified and whatnot. We are looking at having provisional licenses for them while they are going through the ISO certification because that can take many months to get so that they can be up and running on day one. We have tried to put in our regulations and implement some strategies to get people up and running and give them some runway to transition. We are still trying to figure some of those pieces out as it relates to testing and track and trace. It’s very hard, especially here with people out there already operating to just flip a switch and everybody is complying with the regulations. We want to be responsible too. I don’t think the public wants us to issue a bunch of licenses without properly vetting them and that’s where those temporary licenses are really going to come into play. It’s that period of time that gives us time to do our investigation because we also want to do responsible licensing. We have a statutory mandate but we also want a quality product and to do responsible licensing, it’s accomplishing all those things at once. It’s intense. Staffing is another big issue. That tends to be a challenge in the civil service process.

What’s been the most surprising thing you have learned about cannabis since you became involved in the industry in 2016?

<div id="collapseThirteen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I am very surprised at how open the industry in California has been with us as the regulators. Telling us about how they do things like their operations, I was sort of surprised about that. I think that’s pretty brave that they let us in, show us how they are doing things, and how they operate, which has been really important for us to really see how these folks are operating and how they have been doing it for many years. The number of people who have really embraced the legislation and the statute and knowing that regulation costs money and it’s not going to be the same, yet they are still very supportive and excited about this being a legal market. I think it’s been really incredible. People want to tell their story which has been really good for me to hear their stories and find out about what they went through and how it was 20 years ago.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>By A&rsquo;Esha Goins</strong></br><em>A&rsquo;Esha Goins is </em><em>assistant manager at </em><em>Nevada Wellness Center and creator of Blackabis, a blog she launched on April 20, 2015 with the African American medical marijuana patient and entrepreneur in mind. </em></p>
</br>


<p><strong>Finding your way to the other side of trauma with cannabis </strong></br>I wasn&rsquo;t sure how to start this piece. How do I have a conversation about what happened on October 1? Should I say where I was? Seems insignificant in comparison to where the victims were. Do I say how I felt? How I feel isn&rsquo;t as important as how the victims and their families feel.</p>
<p>Honestly, I am unsure if anything I write matters in comparison.</p>
<p>Almost a month ago, Las Vegas was involved in a mass shooting. This city and I will never be the same.</p>
<p>Two days after the shooting I boarded a plane to California to see my son. The timing couldn&rsquo;t have been any better. I was overwhelmed with emotions and I needed to hug my son. As I sat on the plane I began to write my son a letter. It&rsquo;s a habit I began the first time I flew away after he was born. It helps relieve my anxiety.</p>
<p>You see, I am Bipolar type 2. As a result of my mental illness, I suffer from mania from time to time. As I get older it gets worst. I am not sure when or why I get anxiety and or panic attacks, they just happen. Here I was on a plane to California two days after the nation&rsquo;s deadliest mass shooting and the pilot had just announced we were going to be delayed due to Air Force One landing.</p>
<p>I felt myself panicking.</p>
<p>I took deep breaths and started talking myself down. Reminding myself that my anxiety was all in my mind. I was okay. Everything would be okay. My panic was increasing and I knew I had just a very few minutes left before I would be irrational. I jumped up and asked to use the restroom. The flight attended told me I had to be quick because they were sure we were going to be given the okay to take off soon.</p>
<p>I went into the restroom and looked at myself in the mirror. I told myself to calm down. Nothing was helping. Thankfully I carry my RELAX CBD vape pen around my neck at all times. I knew I was risking being thrown off the plane but I had to take the chance. I was overwhelmed and seconds away from a full-fledged panic attack. If you&rsquo;ve never had a panic attack, for some, the symptoms mimic a heart attack.</p>
<p>I inhaled the vape three times and allowed myself to relax.</p>
<p>The flight attendant knocked on the door and said they had been given the okay to take off and I would need to take my seat. I sprayed my body spray before exiting and went to my seat. My anxiety had subsided before we had taken off. I relaxed and enjoyed my flight.</p>
<p>Many people are suffering from 1 October in a variety of ways. I have received an influx of questions regarding cannabis and its effects on PTSD, anxiety, and stress. Every time someone asks me about treating their ailments I ALWAYS recommend a CBD (cannabidiol) treatment. CBD is cannabis&rsquo; secret weapon and has significant medical benefits, but does not make people feel &ldquo;stoned&rdquo; and can actually counteract the psycho-activity of&nbsp;THC. The serum comes in many different forms -- one less intrusive than the other. CBD has been known to send lifetime illnesses in remission and submission. The cannabinoid has been effective in dissolving blood clots, acts as a healing aid for skin issues and has anti-inflammatory properties.</p>
<p>For me, it takes the place of my anti-depressants and anxiety pills.</p>
<p>I am proud of how the Las Vegas community has come together and loved on each other. If I were able to, I would have offered EVERY SINGLE one of the victims and their families a week&rsquo;s supply of CBD elixir. I know it would have aided in some relief as they dealt with what they had witnessed. We are #VegasStrong.</p>

<p><strong><em>post date: October 4</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>When being the &ldquo;only&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t a win </strong></br>The weight of being THE ONLY is something I wake up to every day. The weight holds me accountable to being focused and intentional. It silently puts a responsibility on me to overachieve and to understand legislative issues and policy. To be the eyes and ears of my Blackness being included. To seek out opportunities for others in the future. To create conversation when necessary and write blogs that make people uncomfortable and think. This is the single most important time of my life and I know it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to dismiss someone who is writing about what they think is going on. It&rsquo;s harder to dismiss someone who knows. I love what I do. I absolutely love taking care of patients and mentoring my staff. Even with all that gratification, I get my feelings hurt every day because of the color of my skin. My team has learned to brush it off but for me whenever it happens, it still stings.</p>
<p>In 2013 my mentor introduced me to the cannabis industry. It wasn&rsquo;t long after that I became a cannabis patient. As a minister in an African American Holiness Church I struggled with coming out as a patient and industry leader. How could I tell my community that I was going to &ldquo;sell drugs legally?&rdquo; I was afraid I would let my pastor, peers and church down. I didn&rsquo;t want to be labeled as a &ldquo;ghetto hood rat&rdquo; because I choose to use cannabis as treatment for my mental health issues. I didn&rsquo;t want to let my community down by entering an industry known for incarcerating my people.</p>
<p>Every time I would show up to a City Council, County Commissioner or state meeting I would desperately scan the room hoping to catch a glimpse of others like me. Desiring to connect with someone who could empathize with what I was experiencing. While I haven&rsquo;t found that community I am looking for, I am grateful to the women in my life who have supported and loved me while I cocooned.</p>
<p>I KNOW I am fortunate that I work in a black-owned establishment. It allows me the opportunity to be who I am freely. To practice and develop my #BLACKGIRLMAGIC openly. To challenge the system AND give voice when the platforms are made available. However, I am very much aware that I work in an industry where my African American owners are the ONLY African American-owned and funded dispensary in Nevada. This makes them part of the one percent of the industry&rsquo;s African American ownership invested in the cannabis space &ndash; a space that is forecasted to have revenues in the $20-billion-dollar range by 2020.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to work for THE ONLY African American dispensary in Nevada. I want to be part of a network of African American dispensary owners in Nevada. I don&rsquo;t feel like I am winning as the &ldquo;only.&rdquo; I feel like an evangelist constantly looking for tent service where others like me are gathered on one accord. I started Blackabis because I hoped it would attract other African American men and women in the cannabis Industry. It is my beacon of light in a dark sea. Today we are few but I believe sooner than later we will be plenty.</p>
</br>
<p><strong><em>Post date: July 3</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>I&rsquo;ll Never Forget </strong></br>It&rsquo;s day three of legalization in Nevada and I&rsquo;m lying on my couch thinking about how many uncles, brothers, and fathers are still incarcerated because of this plant I&rsquo;ve been legalized to sell.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day before our first legalized Independence Day in Nevada and I&rsquo;m STILL fighting for my freedom.&nbsp;I KNOW the police pulled over African Americans this weekend to see if they were high. I know our neighborhoods are being overpoliced and targeted because &ldquo;we&rsquo;re getting high.&rdquo; I haven&rsquo;t forgotten.</p>
<p>I love this nation but I don&rsquo;t always feel loved by this nation. I&rsquo;m still the black girl working in an industry where they call my brothers thugs.&nbsp;I won&rsquo;t forget BECAUSE I&rsquo;ll always be black first.I think my community thinks I&rsquo;ve forgotten. But I&rsquo;ll never forget whose blood was shed for my opportunities. As a matter of fact, I strive for excellence in an industry where I&rsquo;m less than one percent because I&rsquo;ve been impregnated with the responsibility to be the best BECAUSE I am the less than one percent.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s now my responsibility to know more, shine brighter, and be even more available. It&rsquo;s become my duty to educate and promote black-owned and black-operated licensed businesses in the industry. To expose people of color in the industry so that our youth can have someone to aspire to be.&nbsp;I also consider it my responsibility to destigmatize African Americans in the marijuana industry. I get offended when people assume I&rsquo;m somewhere &ldquo;getting high&rdquo; just to get high because I&rsquo;m &ldquo;in the Industry.&rdquo; Then when I&rsquo;m with my white counterparts, they are being considered industry leaders and are being asked legitimate industry questions.The media strategically puts&nbsp;<em>African</em>&nbsp;<em>Americans</em>&nbsp;on the news in their stories. They want to pacify us to believe we are more. We aren&rsquo;t&hellip;.</p>
</br>
<p><strong><em>post date: June 30</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dawn of Legalization in&nbsp;Nevada</strong></br>In less than 24 hours Nevada will sell marijuana to adults over 21. In an industry full of people of means and plenty of resources, there is an anxiousness to stop the bleeding of cash. An estimated 46 dispensaries in Nevada, all medical facilities, have been operating in the hope of seeing this day.Many of the industry leaders in Nevada&nbsp;have spent most of their lives believing marijuana was a gateway drug and everyone who smokes it was a thug. Some of them still do. However, tomorrow night, they will ALL make their mark as the FIRST to sell marijuana legally in Nevada.Las Vegas is estimated to have over 323,000 visitors this 4th of July weekend. Many of them will absolutely try pot for the first time while they are here. I wonder how many of those people will walk into a minority-owned establishment and purchase minority products?While I will admit this is a time to celebrate, I also cannot help but mourn a little. I know that someone in my community is STILL incarcerated for the same amount of marijuana someone else this weekend&nbsp;is going to be able to purchase &ldquo;legally.&rdquo;In 2016 I advocated for Question #2 because I knew legalization was what was best for my community. Not because of the dollar but because if there is a possibility ONE of my brothers didn&rsquo;t go to jail for pot, my community wins. Also, because I have a minority son and it is my responsibility to make a better future for him. </p>
<p>So, although legalization is a victory for those who will profit, I am very much aware of the places where my community is losing. There is one black-owned dispensary, three black-owned cultivations, and not one black-owned lab. That means the odds of someone walking into a ethnicity-owned dispensary is 45 to 1&nbsp;and the odds of someone buying a minority made product is 75 to 3. I know these numbers sound unreal but I&nbsp;can only write what I know.&nbsp;This is the place where I&nbsp;mourn our loss.<br />My mentor once told me, &ldquo;Everyone is okay with minorities being employees, NO ONE wants us to&nbsp;own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have seen the future of this industry and I am few and far between. The future is white, male doctors, scientists, lawyers and politicians. They ALL believe this plant can help treat many ailments but their true consumers are minorities. Marijuana is legal, they are getting paid and they STILL just see us as thugs.</p>

<p>In this Growers Spotlight, Hunter Wilson of <a href="http://ss1.us/a/zAEJh21b">Growers Network</a> interviews Kevin McKernan of <a href="http://www.medicinalgenomics.com/">Medicinal Genomics</a> about the benefits of establishing an in-house testing laboratory for your cannabusiness. <br /><br /><strong>Why should growers build an in-house laboratory?</strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, you shouldn&rsquo;t focus on doing third-party laboratory work because you will always need them for conflict-of-interest reasons. Instead, you should focus on the additional benefits an in-house laboratory can provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>For establishing internal quality assurance.</li>
<li>To test products before they enter packaging.</li>
<li>To test for things that third-party testing laboratories don&rsquo;t. For example:</li>
<ul>
<li>Find out if your seeds are feminized</li>
<li>Early detection of potential pathogens</li>
<li>Find microbes in your soil and on your leaves.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are some reasonable things to build an in-house laboratory for?</strong><br />Building a complete lab that could test everything would cost around $1.5 million, which isn&rsquo;t necessary for most operations. Instead, focus on the tests that what will give you the biggest bang for your buck:<br /><strong>Genetic Testing</strong> will probably give you a good ROI. You can test for pests, aid your breeding program, and spot potential problems early on. These tests can also help prevent crop loss, which has a very heavy cost for grows.<br /><strong>Cannabinoid Testing</strong> is more expensive than genetics tests, but it has a good ROI as well. You&rsquo;ll generally need an HPLC machine and technician to test for cannabinoids. Models vary in price from $10,000 to $100,000. <br /><strong>Heavy Metals:</strong> Testing for heavy metals provides a relatively low ROI. You should only pursue this if you&rsquo;re a large company that wants to streamline quality assurance. <br /><strong>Pesticides:</strong> Testing for pesticides is extremely expensive and has a very low ROI for growers. You should already know what&rsquo;s gone into your plant.</p>
<p><strong>What are some different uses for an in-house lab?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Test mothers for pathogens before cloning.</li>
<li>Determine seed sex.</li>
<li>Discover pathogens while they&rsquo;re dormant.</li>
<li>Speed up your breeding programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cannabis is still a relatively young industry. As rules and regulations change, an in-house laboratory may keep your operation compliant. In the long run, a genetics laboratory can help identify genes useful for your breeding programs.</p>
<p><strong>What is necessary to start an in-house laboratory?</strong><strong><br /></strong>At minimum, general equipment necessary would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lab bench</li>
<li>Pipetters and pipette tips</li>
<li>A mixer/vortexer</li>
<li>Any necessary reagents</li>
<li>Test tubes, gloves, cotton swabs, and forceps</li>
<li>Any tools related to the tests you&rsquo;d like to perform.</li>
</ul>
<p>The personnel you will need will depend on the tests you are looking to perform. Simpler tests will require a person with a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree in microbiology or a related field. More complicated tests will probably need somebody with a Master&rsquo;s degree in chemistry.</p>
<p><strong>If I&rsquo;m managing an operation, how does an in-house laboratory effect my bottom line?</strong><strong><br /></strong>If you&rsquo;re a small operation, an in-house lab can be a huge burden and may not be worth the cost. However, if you&rsquo;re a mid- to large size operation, the cost will be relatively minor compared to what it could save you. The average cannabis plant is worth about $650 to a cultivation and when you&rsquo;re growing thousands of plants, a pest incident could cost you a fortune. A laboratory is like your own insurance policy, protecting you from potentially catastrophic losses.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of standards are necessary for cannabis labs?</strong><strong><br /></strong>There&rsquo;s two big ones, depending on where you&rsquo;re located: The AHP or <a href="http://www.herbal-ahp.org/">American Herbal Pharmacopeia</a> recommends six standard tests for third-party labs:</p>
<ul>
<li>E. Coli</li>
<li>Salmonella</li>
<li>Enterobacteria</li>
<li>Coliform Bacteria</li>
<li>Total Yeast/Mold</li>
<li>Total Bacterial Count</li>
</ul>
<p>The EHP or European Herbal Pharmacopeia is what Europeans and Canadians follow. The EHP recommends the same tests as AHP, plus two more: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Both of these standards are only concerned with human pathogens, and an in-house laboratory can fill the gap.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Roger Martin started giving medical cannabis to vets in 2013 and in January 2014 made it official by establishing non-profit organization Grow for Vets. Although a U.S. Army veteran, Martin says the impetus for starting the charity was not his military service, but instead it was the healthcare options available to vets today. “It was only after meeting many young vets who were taking 20-25 different drugs a day because they were free and they couldn’t afford to buy cannabis that I decided to start Grow for Vets,” says Martin, who believes cannabis saved his life and helped him quit a habit that included180 milligrams of Oxycontin and 40 milligrams of Ambien a day.

Why did you start Grow for Vets? </a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">
 In 2013, I was training my German Shepherd puppy at a training facility and I met a lot of young vets who were taking 20-25 different prescription drugs a day and several of them told me cannabis was the only thing that had ever helped them with chronic pain, PTSD, and a myriad of other medical issues. They could not afford to buy cannabis all the time because it was pretty expensive so they took the drugs the VA was shoving down their throats because they were free. It was an economic deal and I had given up on the government ever doing anything as I had spent months writing senators and congressmen, the VA, and anybody else I could think of. I never got a response so I gave up on the government doing anything and decided to take matters into my own hands. I realized what an obscene situation it was that these brave men and women were taking these dangerous and deadly drugs because they couldn’t afford any other alternative. That’s when I decided I was going to give free cannabis to all the veterans I could.

Do you actually grow cannabis for the vets or is it donated? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Initially we grew it. I didn’t ever do this with the idea of being a nonprofit organization. I really just thought we would grow some cannabis and it would kind of be a weekend hobby thing. I would get together with 20 vets in Colorado Springs and give them free cannabis and that would be it. It kinda worked like that for the first year but once I formalized it and Grow for Vets was born it just went viral very quickly after that. By May or June of 2014, we were no longer able to grow enough cannabis to give out. It wasn’t even a close call because it just exploded overnight. We decided we would stop doing that and rely on generous growers, both businesses and individuals, to help us out. In turn, we have been able to give away over $1.5 million dollars’ worth of free cannabis products to veterans in a little over 3-½ years, all thanks to the generosity of the people and companies who support us.

</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It was and still is to this day. It’s pretty much an on-the-job training kind of thing. I tried to educate myself as much as I could by reading and also talking to other people who have experience in running non-profits. Grow for Vets is the first organization to give free cannabis to vets. I always wanted to take the high road. I knew the only way we were going to get help for vets was to convince soccer moms that veterans deserved the right to choose whatever medical option they wanted to and they weren’t going to be impressed by marijuana, pot, ganja and all the other slang terms. That’s why we decided we were going to grow cannabis for veterans and that’s where the name came from.

How does the donation process work?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

My philosophy has changed recently about that. Our signature events, which is the free giveaway of cannabis, is probably what we are known for. And due to those events, I would find myself with tens of thousands of dollars’ worth of product in my vehicle. In the last nine or ten months I started thinking about the people who were helping us out in other states and cities and they were younger vets with families. I decided the risk to them is not worth the reward. The only time we give away free medical cannabis products is at events that I am physically present at. So, if something were to go wrong, I am the one they are going to come to not the other people who are working the event.

Does the type of medicine you distribute vary from month to month?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It’s based on what we have on hand. That’s what dictates what we can give out. I hate to equate it with a food bank but it’s kinda the same type of system. What we are giving out today probably won’t be the same thing we are giving out next week. We don’t try and supply veterans with all the cannabis they are going to need for any given timeframe. Our whole point is education, we are primarily trying to educate veterans that there is a safe alternative to the deadly drug cocktails that they are using. We try to put a bunch of different types of cannabis products in the bags we give out. We will give them an edible, a topical. We try not to give away a lot of flower. Part of the reason for that is I am anti-smoking anything and also researchers universally agree that smoking cannabis is the least effective way to deliver it as a medicine. We are really trying to introduce veterans to safer delivery methods. That’s why we entered into an IPO with O.penVAPE and are using their cartridges; it’s much safer, it’s much more effective in terms of the actual delivery of the medicinal values of cannabis.

<div class="panel-body">

Not at this point, but I am sure that day will come the way people are signing up. It’s bound to happen at some point but all we can do is do the best we can. When we first decided to do this, I could have been an advocate or a lobbyist but I decided the way to do it was to be on the ground and help one vet at a time so that’s kind of our philosophy. We don’t try to supply vets with everything for a month. We want them to try some different things and then go to our sponsors and buy the other things that they need. It’s a difficult task because there are a lot of veterans out there who need help.

As a former military service member and having been in law enforcement, did you have any qualms about getting involved with federally illegal businesses?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Absolutely, I had qualms about getting involved in even using cannabis myself. When it came to Grow for Vets we did our first big public event in Denver on Memorial Day in 2014. I had just a handful of volunteers and sponsors and to tell you the truth I wasn’t sure that I wasn’t going to get arrested. I had gone to the police department and told them what I was doing. I introduced myself, gave them my cell phone number and told them if they had any questions to let me know. From a practical standpoint, unless the police think you are doing something blatantly illegal like transporting cannabis products across state lines or something stupid like that, especially in a major city like Denver or Las Vegas, the police could care less about anything that has to do with cannabis being given to veterans. The other thing is I figured out early on that there isn’t any politician or law enforcement agency who wants to be seen as anti-veteran in this day and age, that would be the kiss of death. While I know we are not bulletproof, I know that does insulate us a little bit. But, yeah, it was certainly on my mind the whole time we were doing it. But it went well and we have never had a negative interaction with law enforcement. Typically, when I talk to them they tell me they are going to keep an extra patrol in the area of the hotel where we are having the event. Not because they are worried about anybody who is there or that anybody is consuming but because its advertised and they are worried about somebody trying to rip us off or something else. They have always been very, very receptive. It’s not that they endorse what I was doing, it’s really more a matter that in Las Vegas, Nevada the police have more important things to deal with then somebody who is giving free cannabis to veterans.

Were veterans ever resistant to trying cannabis to combat PTSD and war wounds?

</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

No. The most difficult part of this job is that a lot of times we meet veterans who don’t just have physical challenges but psychological challenges so that can be really tough. For instance, if you are dealing with someone today and everything is hunky-dory and then tomorrow you happened to hit them when they are having an issue with PTSD, it can be really tough. Until last year, I would say probably 80 or 90 percent of the vets we served were from the Iraq and the Afghanistan war era. It was only about a year-and-a-half ago that we really started drawing in older vets. Because, again, I think that has a lot to do with history too, so I have been pleased to see that. I think the biggest rise in numbers has been guys from the first Gulf War era, so guys that are like between 45 and 50. We are starting to really broaden out our membership base in that regard.

Coming from a very regimented organization like the military, is it frustrating working in the cannabis industry? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It can be difficult. I have always run Grow for Vets as a military operation, if you will. Finding people who will do what they tell you they are going to do, in my experience, is much more difficult than anything I have ever been involved in. Part of that goes back to this: In the beginning a lot of people who became involved in the legal cannabis business were criminals. And I don’t mean they were criminals because they illegally grew marijuana, I mean they were freaking criminals. I have met some that even though they have a license now to do what they used to do when it was illegal, that’s just not quite enough for them. They still have to engage in illegal activities which to me defies logic when you think about what it takes to get a license now. In my mind, these licenses are as valuable as a medical license and most doctors don’t risk their medical licenses.

How are you shifting the paradigm as far as veterans using cannabis?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

 I get wives who tell me all the time thank you for saving my husband’s life. I get kids who thank me for giving them back their daddy. But when they thank me, they are thanking Grow for Vets. I just happen to be the face of Grow for Vets but it’s the magic of this herb. As far as shifting the paradigm, that’s how you do it, you get people who bought into the Reefer Madness hysteria and you show them the real deal. This isn’t about gangs selling marijuana to kids in seventh grade. This is about the medicinal benefits of the plant that has been used for thousands of years for medicinal purposes and only because of self-serving idiotic politicians that the paradigm shifted to the fact that it became viewed as a drug as dangerous as heroin and cocaine.  

As far as the VA and its caregivers, there’s been a big paradigm shift there too. When I first started Grow for Vets, I would hand my business card to one of my healthcare providers and I would tell them what I was doing and they would kind of nod their head and smile but they always slid the card back across the desk. They wouldn’t take my freakin’ card. After doing this about a one or one-and-a-half years, that changed. Not only did they take my card, they wanted to be educated. A couple people from the VA actually asked me to come in and make a presentation specifically about cannabis.

Has cannabis helped veterans in any other ways?

<div id="collapseEleven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

 The fact of the matter is a lot of people have substituted cannabis for alcohol. That’s another issue we face daily. An unbelievable amount of veterans are alcoholics and nothing has changed from my day. If you go to a VFW club and say I’m having nightmares and night terrors, there’s going to be somebody there who is going to put their arm around you and say let’s go have a couple of beers. Their number one revenue stream in those kinds of clubs is alcohol. Many vets who come to us are hardcore alcoholics and that’s very, very difficult. The nice thing is I have seen a lot of veterans quit drinking because they substitute cannabis. That’s been one of the cooler things I have seen is veterans who aren’t just replacing drugs with cannabis, but also replacing alcohol with cannabis. Alcohol destroys lives and families and your body just like drugs do.

You are working on a new venture called Operation AirDrop. What’s its mission?

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwelve" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I had always pooed-pooed hemp. But about 18 months ago, a company approached us and they had a salve made strictly from hemp. One of our older vets who had been to our events and had severe shoulder pain, and the drugs weren’t helping him a heck of a lot, started using it. When he came to the next event a month later, he was ranting and raving about it and still does to this day and so that changed my attitude about hemp. So, we are preparing to launch a new project called Operation AirDrop and that program will allow us to ship free hemp oil-based products to veterans in all 50 states. I am excited about doing that because one of the most difficult parts of my job for the last four years has been getting letters and emails mostly from moms and wives begging me to help their son or daughter but they live in a state where cannabis isn’t legal. It’s been very frustrating to me not to be able to help those people at all. I’m really excited that soon we will be able to help veterans in all 50 states and once again we will be blazing the trail on that. We will be the first ones to ever do this.

Tens of thousands. In less than four years we have given thousands of veterans more than $1.5 million dollars in free cannabis products. How many vets we can help through Operation AirDrop will be dictated by the amount of donations we receive. Right now, the main thing we are raising money for is Operation AirDrop which is going to require us to get an industrial warehouse space where we can actually store the hemp-based CBD products.

The people who I have met who had stage 4 cancer and had their cancer not just go into remission, but it disappeared. And I have seen several of those now. We used to manufacture this high-grade tincture that was 28 percent THC and 20 percent CBD, it was very close to a 1:1 ratio. We used to give out bottles of it in 60-day supplies. At one event a lady who had stage 4 liver cancer came up to me and told me I had given her a bottle of the oil four months ago and it saved her life. She said, ‘My doctor is amazed that my cancer didn’t get worse, it went away. He had never seen that before and he was absolutely flabbergasted.’ That was my first experience with that.

It hasn’t been a success to me until the day comes when veterans have safe access to free medical cannabis the same way they have safe access to the free deadly drugs that are killing over 18,000 of us a year. And that day will come not just when the VA doctors can issue a recommendation for cannabis, that day will come when the VA pays for a veteran to go to a licensed dispensary every month and obtain whatever amount of cannabis they need for treatment of their medical conditions. That’s my goal and hopefully it will happen in my lifetime. I really do believe at some point it will happen.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Chef Payton Curry from Flourish Kitchens and Exhale Dispensary</h4>
<p>As a young adult, Payton Curry began to cultivate a career in the culinary arts, starting with a degree from Culinary Institute of America and later owning a popular eatery in Scottsdale, AZ as well as consulting. Although cannabis has always had a place in Curry’s life, health concerns caused the chef to re-examine his diet and habits, forgoing alcohol and turning his skills and acumen towards cannabis and the therapeutic properties of the vegetable. Using his culinary background, Curry began creating small batches of non-ethanol tinctures, a business that blossomed into Flourish Cannabis. Curry has mainstreamed cannabis products and uses his talents to create everything from savory sauces to confections and petits fours. As part of his platform, Curry holds back 20 percent of Flourish for a staff contribution which benefits the employees of Flourish and the communities in which they live and work. With edible cannabis products as the focus of Flourish, Curry is attempting to shatter the propaganda and stigma surrounding the plant. </p>

<h2>The Jive Turkey</h2>
<h4>Ingredients:</h4>
14 lb. fresh turkey (defrosted, if frozen)
6 fresh sage leaves, roughly chopped
8 fresh thyme stems
4 sprigs of rosemary
4 sprigs of oregano
1-1/2 cup cannabis-infused mayonnaise
1/2 cup cannabutter
1-2 Tbsp. coarse salt and pepper
3 celery stalks, chopped
1 onion, chopped

<h4>Method:</h4>
<p>Preheat oven to 450°F. Lay turkey in a roasting pan. Remove leaves from herbs' stems. Add sage, thyme, rosemary and oregano to mayonnaise; combine well. Rub mayonnaise/herb mixture all over outside and interior of bird. Liberally salt and pepper turkey. Add celery and onion, inside and out, and tuck cannabutter into the cavity. </p>
<p>Roast turkey in 450°F oven for 30 minutes. Then turn the oven down to 350°F and insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh. Continue roasting, uncovered, until internal thermometer reaches 160°F. Cover legs with foil partway through roasting if desired. Depending on size of turkey, total cook time will be around 1-1/2 to 2 hours. Once the thermometer reaches 160°F in the thigh, check the internal temperature of the thickest part of the breast to make sure it reads 160°F as well. </p>

<p>In a cast iron or stainless-steel pan, slowly render bacon chunks until almost crispy, about 6 to 8 minutes. Add blanched Brussels sprouts (cut side down) to the pan and turn heat to medium high. Sear the sprouts in batches until all are golden brown. Combine sprouts and bacon with garlic, herbs, flax seeds and cannabis oil in a large pan and season with salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice. </p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>“Cannabis is light in our world of darkness,” explains Juan Matthew De La Tour, who suffers from Autistic Spectrum Disorder and gets overwhelmed and overstimulated by unnatural light. &ldquo;I think about a million things at once so it helps me focus. Autism is like having a paragraph on your tongue and not being able to get it out.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>De La Tour, 35, uses cannabis to quiet his mind. &ldquo;All the chaos stops. I hear machinery in my head constantly, the ideas are always going but with cannabis I am able to find the frequency I desire. It&rsquo;s like being able to tune the radio in your head and I can put the music on that I want to. I would be so much angrier without it. I don&rsquo;t know where I would be without it right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An artist from Bald Eagle, Pennsylvania, De La Tour also finds refuge from his illness in being creative. &ldquo;My art is definitely about beauty from chaos and victory from misery, that&rsquo;s what inspires me. Most pieces I make are out of chaos and sadness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De La Tour has not only been busy creating approximately 120 paintings during the last six years, but he has also developed the De La TouR technique using joint compound. &ldquo;I use my hands as tools to create a pattern in drywall,&rdquo; he explains of his method. &ldquo;You just glide your hand like a tender dance across the wall with your fingers and draw circles in that. I&rsquo;m going to change the world with it before I die -- that&rsquo;s my goal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>De La Tour also &ldquo;wants the power to help people and crush the forces of darkness and be a light in this world,&rdquo; he says of his art. &ldquo;Each year I am making progress. My posters will be all over the world selling and then I can use that as a platform to help people.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Justin Alexander</h4>
Does cannabis make you more creative? This is an age-old question for which there seems to be no scientific answer but, instead, only limited research and positive opinions. A 2010 study published in Psychiatry Research journal showed one of cannabis’s primary properties is its ability to increase hyper-priming, or make connections between seemingly unrelated concepts. Research also suggests that cannabis blurs the lines between a person’s five senses, allowing for an increased capacity in that realm. 
But like with many so things, creativity depends on the user, the situation and the strain, since a person’s state of being is subjective. But at the very least we know cannabis helps reduce a person’s inhibitions and turns off their “inner-editor” for more of a free-flowing experience while writing, drawing, creating art and music, or brainstorming.
elevate has found nine products from the Nevada marketplace that can help get the creative juices flowing and may inspire a new way to look at cannabis use when a creative block has become an obstacle.

Remedy’s Outer Space flower, Silver Sage Wellness </a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">
 Noting that cannabis is an essential part of his creative process, Amed Donado, marketing administrator for Silver Sage Wellness, says, “Cannabis, for me, is the [building block] for my creativity. Without cannabis, I wouldn't be where I currently am. Without my creativity, I wouldn't be able to live.” 
Drawing a comparison to nature, he says, if creativity is a stream, cannabis removes the stones and allows it to flow freely. When Donado sits down to get fully immersed in his imagination, he reaches for the balanced hybrid strain Outer Space from Remedy. “I feel like the high amount of beta-myrcene in Outer Space allows me to relax and think with a clear head and to be able to work at my full potential,” he says. 
Silver Sage originally acquired the strain from Denver Relief, and Donado says it has been on the shelf ever since. “Nick Hice, their master grower, picked up the strain many years ago from a grower in the mountains—presumably the original breeder.”
Heavy on sativa with an uplifting cerebral high, the first thing to note when smoking Outer Space is its totally unique taste—deep and earthy, like inhaling morning air straight from the forest, sour and pungent. The smell is sweet with whiffs of a floral bouquet intertwined with citrus fruits. Testing in at 25.8 percent THC and .05 percent CBD, Outer Space is relaxing, yet focus can be maintained, which makes it a great dayti

Glass Slipper distillate cartridge, The+Source
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

If you are looking for a totally relaxing high with a big cerebral boost, sativa-dominant hybrid Glass Slipper fits. In fact, you might even lose a shoe while drifting off into a creative space without a care in the world. Perfect for calming creative types who have mental blocks due to anxiety, Glass Slipper is an offspring of Cinderella 99 and Pineapple 99. It is an easy smoke and a pleasing high even for those less experienced with cannabis. Also, for those who have a hard time finding a truly calming medicine, Glass Slipper is ideal.
“It’s my feeling that as cannabis relaxes the human condition, the right side of the human brain relaxes as well,” says Eric V. Vega, director of operations at Nevada Organic Remedies. “In this relaxed state the creative side of the brain can see a boost in spatial awareness and imagination.”
The relaxing, sedative effect is a product of the terpene terpinolene, “which also works as an antioxidant, improving cognitive skills and slowing the aging of the brain,” Vega says of Glass Slipper which offers a ratio of 82.92 percent THC to 1.0 CBD.

FlavRX’s Blue Dream premium disposable cartridge
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It is said that dreams are a manifestation of one’s creative subconscious. Keep that in mind when vaping FlavRX’s Blue Dream, a sativa-dominant hybrid that will transport you into a sublime creative state while wide awake.
“Cannabis certainly can help unlock a person’s creativity, as many musicians and artists will proclaim,” says Kawehi Galuteria, brand ambassador for Evergreen Organix. “It depends on the individual and the specific strains they are utilizing. Cannabis possesses both CBD, which is naturally produced in the brain, and THC that closely resembles anandamide, which is a natural transmitter to neurons in the brain. This combination could potentially amplify a person’s thinking by allowing neurons to fire without as much interruption.” 
FlavRX takes great care in mixing specific strains with proprietary terpenes, and Blue Dream was carefully curated to make sure the quality of the oil concentrate matched the taste and effects of the flower. “It’s a complex combination of terpenes derived directly from strain-specific cannabis and matching them with the pungent effects of certain fruit profiles, which also have their therapeutic properties,” Galuteria says of the distillate that tests at 56.20 percent THC. 
Blue Dream works especially well for creative pursuits because it simulates without pushing the user into overdrive. “When trying this product, look for increased relaxation and a feeling of happiness,” Galuteria advises. “The combination is in fact not to overstimulate the mind, but certainly puts you in a creative and highly functional state.” 
With no sedative vibes, Blue Dream relieves pain, nausea and depression throughout the day. “The effects of cannabis on the mind also have a lot to do with the individual person,” Galuteria says. “If a person has had a busy day and they keep going back into their mind over and over again to make sure they didn't miss anything, but all they want to do is sit down, relax and work on their art project, the euphoric effects of the cannabis could ease them into a place where creativity can assume control over the mind and suppress the stressful recap of the busy day.”

State Flower’s Cherry AK, The Apothecarium LV
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

The terpenes of limonene and pinene present in Cherry AK are most likely responsible for inspiring awareness and creativity, according to State Flower Cannabis’ Daniel Wacks. He stumbled upon it by accident at a dispensary in Oakland several years ago. “I thought the nose was really unique—almost offensive, but in an enticing way,” he recalls. “When we started growing it a few years later, it became a go-to for me at times when I was looking for a little shift in perspective.” It is a scent that he describes as cherries and garlic—super fruity with earthy notes and a robust woody aftertaste. 
“Most growers believe Cherry AK to simply be a rare phenotype of AK-47 with a fruitier nose and dense bud structure as compared to the classic iteration,” Wacks says of the strain that tests at 21.89 percent THC. “AK-47 is a mostly sativa cross of a bunch of landraces from the 1970s from all over the world—Colombia, Mexico, Thailand and Afghanistan.”
The strain is known for its many positive qualities, including being an effective analgesic. Terpene caryophyllene is also found in Cherry AK and is known as an antioxidant good for the treatment of muscle spasms, pain, and insomnia. Pinene, a natural bronchodilator effective in treating respiratory conditions, is also present.
Since Cherry AK inspires both relaxation and focus—which go hand in hand in the quest for creativity—Wacks draws a comparison to the practice of Mindfulness Relaxation, a therapeutic technique that uses breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind, and help reduce stress. “The process essentially allows one to attain a higher state of awareness through relaxation,” he says. “In that sense, Cherry AK's balanced effect provides just the right level of relaxation to help elevate awareness and creativity.”
Getting to a place of relaxed clarity is exactly what smoking Cherry AK can provide as euphoria leads to engagement and then connection, awareness, and creative flow. “Cannabis doesn't "make" you creative per se, but it can certainly help you flow,” Wacks says, citing Scott Barry Kaufman, scientific director of The Imagination Institute who defines "flow" as "the mental state of being completely present and fully immersed in a task [which] is a strong contributor to creativity.” Kaufman continues, “When in flow, the creator and the universe become one, outside distractions recede from consciousness and one’s mind is fully open and attuned to the act of creating. There is very little self-awareness or critical self-judgement; just intrinsic joy for the task."

Mary Chino live resin from Medizin Premium Concentrates
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

A cross between Cherry Kush and Orange Tahoe, Mary Chino live resin induces an intense high that boosts energy, brain power, and the ability to concentrate with laser accuracy. It brings you into the present so you can tackle projects in a unique and creative way. With the Mary Chino as with all resins, a little goes a long way at 65.2 percent THC.
“This genetic cross seemed like a happy medium of effects that we were striving for,” offers David Farris, director of marketing at Medizin. “Studies have shown myrcene lowers the resistance across the blood to brain barrier. This allows for a greater maximum psychoactive effect, and a quicker one at that. The calming aspect of terpinolene also assists in the relaxed thought process without being [overbearing] on your high.”
Its consistency is gooey sugar and flavors of tropical orange are a delightful and refreshing way to clear the mind freeing it to explore outside the boundaries of the day-to-day rigmarole.

Bliss distillate cartridge by City Trees, Oasis Cannabis

<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

When seeking a product that can be characterized as a creativity inducer, look for prominent levels of beta-caryophyllene, alpha-pinene and limonene. Bliss distillate cartridge offers all these properties, making it a sure-fire way to fire on all cerebral cylinders. 
“Almost like releasing a caged animal, cannabis leaves the mind free from the usual stress and burdens of day-to-day life,” says Don Decatur, City Trees’ director of operations. “Once the effects have set in and the user is relaxed, deep and creative thoughts are easily conjured.”
City Trees’ Bliss blend has a mild hybrid effect—a dash of focus with a hint of calming. Bliss tests at 79.6 percent THC and .75 percent CBD. The flavor is also mild for those who are sensitive to taste and want a more neutral smoke. 
As an added benefit, City Trees Bliss cartridges are refillable. “This allows users to reuse the cartridges and helps lower the environmental impact of this product,” notes Decatur.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Cookie Stomper is Elephant Stomper crossed with Monster Cookies to produce a sativa-dominant hybrid. With a smell and taste that can be compared to a jammy grape, the high is mellow and cerebral and has no sedative effects. It frees the mind from all blocks and barriers including sleepiness and lack of focus. 
This strain is high in limonene, myrcene, linalool and isopulegol with hints of camphene—all of which are terpenes that add to its special creativity-inducing composition. This is a rich smoke through and through and can be enjoyed by patients with varying levels of cannabis experience. Testing in at 24.21 percent THC and .018 CBD, expect a smooth burn.

L’Orange by Cannabiotix

<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Part Orange Crush part Lemon Burst, the name L’Orange is indicative of the scent of this pungent flower—pure, fresh citrus (also expect bright orange on the buds). When broken down, olfactory greatness wafts through the room in the most pleasant way while your fingers retain a residue of sugary stickiness. 
The buzz is a happy one and perfect for morning creative sessions when you need to be at your peak. It is a get-out-of-bed-and-enjoy-the-day “morning sativa.” 
“The terpene concoction gives you an uplifting and happy high,” says Cannabiotix COO Neema Samari. “I definitely think the sativas and sativa-dominant hybrids give you a creative buzz, no couchlock and get the juices flowing. Everyone’s endocannabinoid system is different and from there being able to knock out creative angles 
and achievements.”
An amazing even burn, the intensity of this product is refreshing and zesty in all its properties. L’Orange tests at between 24 and 27 percent THC and .015 percent CBD.

Kannabis’ Purple Dream flower, The Grove
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

True to its name, Purple Dream takes you into a beautiful royal haze even when the tasks of the day are mundane. Everything becomes just a little bit more fun and a little bit more creative under the gaze of Purple Dream. A cross between the sativa-dominant hybrid Blue Dream, known for its lucid cerebral high, and the indica-dominant Grand Daddy Purple, known for its body buzz, Purple Dream is a great hybrid perfect for mid-afternoon or evening smoke sessions. Before you partake, make sure to have snacks on hand as this “dream” comes with the strong case of the munchies in addition to wildly imaginative thoughts.
Because of the desire to reach a dreamlike state, it is no accident that many creatives use cannabis while working, says Zach Wright, store manager for The Grove’s Pahrump location. 
“Cannabis unlike other intoxicants contains chemicals and compounds naturally produced within the body,” Wright says. “The cannabinoids can increase the rate in which neurons fire in the brain allowing the user to feel a sense of focus and well-being.”
This strain not only tests at 26.10 percent THC but it has the terpene limonene, which elevates mood, increases alertness, and offers antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects. “In my opinion, cannabis in general is always a happy ‘accident,’” Wright says. “While always striving to create perfect phenotypes, The Grove’s state-of-the-art cultivation continues to make strides in the right direction, ensuring all consumers needs are accounted for. This just happens to be one of those.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[</span><strong>Agent: </strong><span >#00710 Bong, James</span><span ><br /></span><strong>Mission:</strong><span >The Bong Who Loved Me</span><span ><br /></span><strong>Status:</strong><span > 00710 APPROVED</span></p>

<p>My mission was to begin at the monthly First Friday art festival in Downtown Las Vegas. In order to blend in among the artists, HighQ outfitted me with the limited-edition Stash GPen Elite Vaporizer. It comes in a spray can bottle and looks like a vaporizer that Andy Warhol would have smoked if one existed in the &lsquo;70s -- genius. Plus, I was really digging the vape's LED screen that allows its user to select their desired burn temperature.</p>
<p>I wound my way through the booths and food trucks, but my senses led me to Blackjack Collective Dispensary that was just a few blocks away. The colorful graffiti mural on the outside foreshadowed the heady local art featured inside the dispensary. As I stood and stared at the images for a bit, their colors and shapes started to move...were they trying to give me clues or had I taken a few too many tokes from the GPen Vape? This, my friends, is the eternal question.</p>
<p>As I panned the display, I locked eyes with a water bottle that had been converted into a bong. Tired of smoking out of apples and beer cans in my youth, I had always dreamed of a portable device to make bongs on the go. I suggested the idea to HighQ and he chuckled, turning his attention to more "complex" projects. And this one was a bargain at only $10. I bought one in all four colors along with eighths of King Louis XIII by House of Herbs and Tangilope by Matrix and raced back to my hotel room.</p>
<p>I dove into the mini bar, pulled out a water bottle and got to work. Could it really be as easy as the instructions on the packaging? The answer is yes! First, screw the Bottle Bong plastic on to any bottle; next, fill the bottle with the preferred amount of water; third, insert and slide the glass bowl and stem; fourth, make a small carb or trigger hole in the bottle; finally, add your flower and hit the Bottle Bong. For good measure, fill it up and hit it again. One hit of the Tangilope and my hotel room morphed into a scene from a Salvador Dali painting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I took the Bottle Bong with me hiking, boating, skiing, tailgating, and of course, on missions. I even keep one on my nightstand for easy access. The Bottle Bong&rsquo;s portability, smooth hits, and $10 price tag stole my heart. I have loved many bongs throughout my life, but for the first time I have found the bong who loved me.</p>

<h4><strong>by Jen Shepherd, R.N. </strong></h4>
<p>Following the tragedy at the Route 91 Harvest Festival on October 1, Las Vegas has been affected on a massive scale. With 22,000 in attendance the night of the concert, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) will impact many in our community for months to come. Following this awful event, I noted many initial PTSD symptoms in both myself and friends and wanted to assist by giving the most current information on how to use cannabis effectively for treating PTSD as well as how to develop healthy coping mechanisms to deal with crisis and trauma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trauma and PTSD are something most people cannot label with words or choose not to talk about when they are experiencing it. More than ever it&rsquo;s important to take care of each other to prevent prolonged distress and not ignore any symptoms. Mental health is our key to happiness and is vital to our quality of life.</p>
<p>When a person has PTSD, it is important for the person to understand what is occurring at the fundamental levels of their body. When undergoing a trauma or crisis, the brain switches into &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; mode. So what does that mean? It means that all the blood is being pulled from normal activities to your muscles. Instead of being in a &ldquo;normal rest and digest mode,&rdquo; your body activates to the &ldquo;fight or flight&rdquo; mode, preparing you for survival. Even with psychological traumas, this occurs. PTSD affects your autonomic nervous system, which controls operations that require zero thinking, such as breathing, circulation, and digestion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are three categories of PTSD:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hyper-arousal &ndash; easily frightened, trouble sleeping, decreased appetite, cyclical thinking/reoccurring thoughts, inability to relax</li>
<li>Avoidance &ndash; avoiding daily activities and friends, staying home</li>
<li>Re-experiencing &ndash; reliving the trauma through flashbacks&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>PTSD is characterized by symptoms of insomnia, anxiety, &ldquo;edginess,&rdquo; paranoia, and heightened senses persisting three months or longer. It is important to note symptoms after experiencing a traumatic event so as to prevent the potential for changes in the brain that can occur after prolonged PTSD symptoms since they can create decreased levels of anandamide production. Anandamide is the &ldquo;bliss molecule&rdquo; that allows humans to be naturally happy. Low levels of anandamide lead to chronic anxiety and aversive memory consolidation by not allowing your brain to get rid of unwanted &ldquo;forget&rdquo; memories. This contributes to the inability to be happy, which means CB1receptors are not triggered to deactivate traumatic events that assist in forgetting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Treatment of initial symptoms prevents long-term issues and assists in resetting your body to rest and digest mode. It is easier to overcome the root cause of trauma once symptom relief occurs which happens with proper sleep, proper appetite, and a feeling of safety. Once these three basic needs have been met, the root cause can be addressed and the steps to healing can begin, which include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Release stored trauma&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fear extension&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ability to develop new positive thought patterns</li>
</ol>
<p>The endocannabinoid system, which is a group of endogenous cannabinoid receptors located in the brain and throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, regulates the hippocampus part of your brain that&rsquo;s responsible for long-term storage, which is where traumatic memories are stored. Prolonged PTSD that goes untreated can lead to shrinking in the hippocampus, but cannabis can restore volume through neurogenesis. Cannabis can assist in the initial symptom relief and helps in developing new thought patterns, which aids in complete PTSD recovery by creating new brain cells through the neurogenesis process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goals in using cannabis for effective initial therapy of PTSD:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decrease in flashbacks/reoccurring cyclical thoughts</li>
<li>Decrease in nightmares</li>
<li>Decrease in negative thought patterns</li>
<li>Reduce arousal if in hyper-arousal state</li>
</ol>
<p>Cannabis is able to accomplish these goals by closing down the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis, which shuts off stress response. When the body is stressed, hormones of cortisol and aldosterone are released from adrenal glands. These are steroid hormones. By shutting off the stress response, cannabis assists the body into homeostasis and rest and digest mode. This is for persons experiencing the hyper-arousal state. Adrenals (root chakra for you yogis) utilize CB1 in the receptor site, meaning delta 9 THC is the key to this receptor and, in theory, should assist with regulating these hormones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those in the avoidance category, cannabis can help by assisting in the prefrontal cortex processes of the brain. The neurotransmitters serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine are regulated and assist with depression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cannabis compound cannabidiol (CBD) is said to have anti-anxiety, anti-psychotic, and antidepressant properties. Most effective CBD therapies are noted to be routine and taken like daily supplements. For relief of ailments such as recurring thoughts, inhalation or sublingual is the quickest route with initial effects usually occuring within 15 minutes. Finding the proper CBD/THC ratio is important and terpenes can also play a factor in effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall goals in trauma recovery:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Continue necessary activities</li>
<li>Restore emotions</li>
<li>Sustain self-esteem</li>
<li>Feel safe and established</li>
<li>Maintain and enjoy personal interactions</li>
<li>Live, laugh, love, and be grateful</li>
</ol>
<p>Every individual handles response to trauma differently. Not everyone will need to talk about the issues or need extensive assistance in recovery. The situation and the person&rsquo;s ability to redirect thoughts and feelings determine their recovery needs, along with a person&rsquo;s experience with trauma and if they have developed healthy coping mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crisis and trauma can affect someone&rsquo;s belief systems on a spiritual level. But what is spirituality? It&rsquo;s a connection that transcends self, an inner-belief system that provides meaning to life. Loss of hope and fear of death are two of the key issues, along with anger directed at a higher being, and are important issues to address. Healthy spirit practices can decrease risky behaviors, expand social support, enhance coping skills, establish understanding of traumatic events, and activate physiological relaxation response through mediation and positive focus rather than isolation and depression. Trauma needs to be addressed through the mind, body, and soul for true recovery. Therapists, social workers, spirit leaders, and energy workers can assist with this process. In some native American cultures, three days after a traumatic event spirit leaders assist their people with a spiritual ceremony. I love this theory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developing proper coping strategies on a soul level include:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Stable social support&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ability to express emotions therapeutically that past trauma may prevent</li>
<li>Developing a creative outlet though art, yoga, nature</li>
</ol>
<p>Developing healthy coping skills is imperative. Learning to tolerate distressing emotions and situations is key to being happy. Helpful techniques include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Practice mindful medication &ndash; practice being in the present moment. I do this when I am doing the dishes (one of the chores I rather dislike); however, I noticed if I pay attention to the way the water and dishes feel as I am cleaning the dishes, it gives me an awareness and makes the chore much easier. I also show appreciation by thanking my dishes for holding my food. I know it sounds silly, but it&rsquo;s how I start my mindful practice each day. It&rsquo;s also pretty cool.</li>
<li>Self-monitor your emotional state &ndash; it&rsquo;s important to notice when you start feeling bad and treat negative thoughts before cyclical patterns get out of control.</li>
<li>Understand your spiritual needs and how to meet them.</li>
<li>Understand your physical and emotional needs and how to meet them.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Understand the coping process and integrate that knowledge.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use journals or autonomic writing &ndash; one of my favorite techniques.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Reestablish empowerment and reach closure.</li>
</ol>
<p>Trauma can impair quality of life, affect a person&rsquo;s brain development, and increase vulnerability, chronic disease, mental illness, and substance abuse. Issues can be addressed, but the only person who can really do the work is the person affected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a community let&rsquo;s work at healing together.&nbsp;</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s not surprising that artist Izaac Zevalking, who succinctly drills down complex societal issues into a solitary image could also, in a single sentence, tackle the meaning of life. “Like life, you are envisioning the endpoint but it’s the journey that is the significant thing,” he notes, adding, “art really embodies that. We acknowledge that there isn’t any endpoint but we still embrace the journey.” 
Zevalking, 30, has used his own journey to create a divergant path. A graphic designer, he moved to Las Vegas five years ago from England to be near his sister. His move proved serendipitous in that it led him to start Recycled Propaganda a year after arriving, which he uses as a springboard for confronting and discussing everything from religion to obseity.  
Of Recycled Propaganda’s origins, Zevalking says, “In essence that is what I try and do with all my work, whatever energy there is, feed off the energy of the people around me and recycle it, hence the name, and spit it out as something that is more useful to society.” 
elevate sat down with Zevalking to talk about his art (which has found its way into several local dispensaries and cultivations), Trump, cannabis, the illogicality of logic, and acceptance of failure.

I moved here and needed an outlet to say the things I was saying without saying them. I just started making images and branded that as Recycled Propaganda. I never had an intention of being an artist until I moved here. It was the way I would sort of cope with the social differences and injustice being more apparent. When you are removed from where you grew up, whether that be domestically or internationally, you have to adjust. England and America are similar enough that you can relate, not so alien that they don’t sort of overlap. England in a lot of ways does follow in the wake in America, a lot of the world does these days. So, a lot of core issues play out here and are much more polarized and apparent here, like genetically modified food and religion, they are all so much more polarized here than in the UK. Here, you have the really fit and aware people and the not-fit and not-aware people, and in England it’s more like gray than so black and white.

It wouldn’t have surprised me. I was in a national exhibition [for art] when I was 14 in England. In school I achieved a lot artistically but it wasn’t an art school.

I have a degree in sports technology, designing sports equipment, and a Master’s degree in 2-D and 3-D visualization. I did graphics and design work as a freelancer. I think if you look at social and political art, it is mostly British people, Banksy being the most famous of them. Maybe it’s the satirical way we are brought up in that country. I never had a plan to do that. All of the big moments in your life don’t happen all of a sudden, they happen as iterations day by day, hour by hour. It wasn’t like all of sudden I was this well-known artist, it’s taken four years to get to that point.

You drill a complex issue down into a single graphic. What skills do you rely on for that? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

The hardest part of what I do is the initial conceptualization of the pieces and there’s no real magic ingredient to it. I just jot down ideas and notions I have and when I am illustrating them I just try different variations and it works or it doesn’t work. The longer you do that sort of thing, the easier it becomes to see what does and doesn’t work visually. So, I rely on a heavy amount of intuition, and I am naturally a creative thinker probably because of the way I was brought up. The other skills I rely on are basically refined through practice. With spray painting or stencil making, you just have to try it and constantly iterate it and try different things to improve it and that’s the key to trying to master art. I think you never will master it but that’s the good thing about it. I like that, that doesn’t put me off. I like that there’s always a direction to it, there is no wrong and right answer so there can’t be any finish to it. It’s like life -- you are envisioning the endpoint but it’s the journey that is the significant thing. Art really embodies that. We acknowledge that there isn’t any endpoint but we still embrace the journey. People often underwrite creative minds as those people are just born creative. But, no, you have to practice, you have to paint a painting every day. I do a design or painting every day and that’s important to keep your skillset sharp. You can’t just expect to be a creative genius, it just appears that way I guess.

Yes, especially since Trump came into the mix and started running for president. He brings a lot of issues to a point, either by doing something or saying something and not necessarily in a bad way either. That has definitely animated the left. I am glad I started the art I was doing prior to that because it’s given me a point of reference to be like, ‘Wow, I did this design in 2014,’ and so this issue has always been there. It’s just people are more aware of it because it’s thrust upon them. It’s fascinating to me, but it’s also been inspirational to see that when more liberal, open-minded people are angry they are more drawn toward art. You are just drawn toward something that isn’t further perpetuating the problem. The point of art is there isn’t a singularity to it, you can observe it in many different ways.

Because your art is so ambiguious it leaves room for varied interpretation.

<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I think the reason the country is so polarized is people don’t view life like that, they view life in such a linear and binary way. The more people value and emphasize art, the more they can learn to not judge stuff and see it from other people’s perspective and not be so polarized. The worst thing someone can say about my art is that they see it in a very specific way because it’s undermining what I am trying to achieve, which is you view it like that but someone else could view it in a totally different way. Isn’t that more important than the issue itself? How we respond to the issue? No matter what design I have created, people have pitched to me crazily different notions of what it means. I like that, the ambiguity is what I want, I want people to be able to view it from both sides of the aisle and still relate to it and still have something to say and reflect on society because of it. I just wish people were aware that phenomenon existed. Like the Trump piece of him spewing sewage, it was about his oil policy, that’s why I did it. But I have had multiple people come by and say, ‘Yeah, Trump is draining the swamp.’ And that’s the beauty of art. And that really evokes to somebody like me as opened-minded and being able to empathize with other people and still fully empathize with the conservative mindset in order to come up with that. That’s really the origin of most issues -- that we don’t fully understand why that person thinks the way they do.

I think they have the most grip on people’s general frame of mind and consciousness more than any other influence. Advertising really is the true artform of America because it is so powerful and evocative. It captures your attention so equivocally that it does it without us even noticing it. That’s what blows my mind more than anything. I could that piece [logo driven pieces] anywhere in the world and people would understand it in any language. To me, the point that it underlines is how much of our attention they have captured and how subtlety they have done it. We aren’t even aware of it. The idea of flipping or turning that power against them, even if it’s a little bit, turns me on I guess. And it’s easy, if you want an image to resonate, use existing imagery that already resonates. People already know it, they have already been brainwashed. Use that brainwashing to try and expand their mind. Use that familiarity with those logos to capture their initial attention. I feel like we are increasingly living in a visually blind society because we are so overexposed to visual and auditory things. It takes more and more to grab our attention and that’s really worrying.

What topic/issue has surprised you the most about how much it resonates with people? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Specifically, with health and wellbeing, I found it quite ironic how unhealthy a lot of America is and how extremely healthy a lot of America is as well and how hyperaware people are of a lot of health stuff, more so than in England. That’s because when you are in the belly of the beast, it produces the flipside of that condition. You can’t drive down the street without seeing 10 fast-food joints. It’s so in our face we have to learn about it. If it wasn’t there, we wouldn’t. I think the awareness that this sort of stuff is so bad for us, yet we are still willing to consume it – there’s an irony in that. Yes, it’s bad for me but it feels good or tastes good. That surprised me how much that resonated with America because for somebody who didn’t grow up in America, it’s viewed as a highly unconcerned country about health. If you look at health policy, school lunches, obesity levels, cancer rates, it’s bad on paper so you don’t expect there to be that undercurrent here. But I think it’s really growing and people are really starting to realize on all fronts how they have been manipulated or taken advantage of just for money. 
The ultimate example of that and saddest example of that is marijuana. You have a substance that is potentially miraculously curing of numerous diseases that has been so propagandized and demonized that people think the opposite of the truth. It’s just a really neat case study, let’s show how we can manipulate thought for a whole generation based on nothing. I think it truly began with schedule I drugs, which are all mind altering. I think the forces that be don’t want you to expand your mind because when you expand your mind enough you see the strings of control being pulled. Peyote is a schedule 1 drug, marijuana is a schedule 1 drug, LSD is a schedule 1 drug, cocaine is a schedule 1 drug. I have done all of those, and you always come to some sort of epiphany. I don’t think any of them, personally, are harmful, especially marijuana. I am not a super hardcore conspiracy theorist but when you zoom out and just learn about history, it’s not really a conspiracy theory, it’s just a string of events and people doing it to further their political career or whatever. Like Reagan’s War on Drugs, just because it resonated with people, it wasn’t necessarily because he believed in it. It’s just sad how evidence and truth don’t have as much of a place as they should. I think the medicine side of this country really illustrates that better than anything.

I’m not a news junkie. A news channel is just generating news because it has to be on 24 hours. I like watching news shows and news segments. I try and do that every day just to see what is happening but I find there is a limited expanse of thought there and there is always such a heavy agenda. I watch Democracy Now and some of it is great and some of it I am like, ‘You are just looking for stuff to criticize Trump for.’ As long as you are aware of the biases, I don’t think there is anything wrong with watching any news. It’s not bad to watch the news if you can critique it and I do because I want to know what’s going on to inform my work and because that’s the kind of person I am. I also really like reading books and watching documentaries because they zoom out on a topic. I don’t get too into Facebook pages and memes because it always makes you feel unsatisfied. If you are trying to have a debate online, it doesn’t work. I talk to people about issues and debate all the time, as you can imagine, and it’s really fun but it’s not fun online because people don’t see you as a human being. The stuff people say to me online...I don’t get offended anymore because I’m used to it. I think, ‘If I saw you in person, you wouldn’t say that to me.’

Yes, I think almost every time I go to do an image. There’s a lot of ideas and a lot of them don’t work as visuals or I can’t wrap my head around it at that moment so I will just move on. Or I will initially want to do one topic but these images come up and it ends up being about something different. It’s not always tidy and linear. It’s almost as if I just allow myself to be a sponge and absorb information and listen to people make reasoned arguments and talk about stuff that’s going on then I sit down and I am doing stuff creatively and I draw upon those things. Sometimes the idea could totally pivot and be something different from my original idea. It depends on what kind of idea it is.

Failure is one of the most important parts about being an artist or doing any profession. Recognizing failure is not doing it as well as you wanted to do it, improving, and then doing it better. Without that reflection and critique of your work, I don’t think you can ever really move anywhere as an artist. People find failure very difficult to embrace. I don’t like to use the word failure because there is no such thing, especially in art, it’s just something that one person didn’t like or I didn’t like that you can iterate until you do. The important thing is that you learn from it and that fear doesn’t get involved because once fear gets involved it shuts down options from the universe. You need to just be open to change. I have a plan for this piece but once I get it out and work on it, it changes and you must embrace it, don’t resist it. Really try and feed off the energy of the people around you or the things going on in society. In essence that is what I try and do with all my work, whatever energy there is, feed off it and recycle it, hence the name, and spit it out as something that is more useful to society. Then it becomes cathartic, doing the artwork and venting it out. For instance, the (Route 91 Harvest Festival) shooting was like that. I was beside myself and then I just sat down and designed something and I did it. It was a really useful process just for me to feel better. We just need to use creativity and figure out how our skillsets can improve the situation. And they can, we just need to be creative about it. Or maybe we just need to be more aware or care more.

I think typically the pieces that are most popular are the ones that draw on something where everybody knows the image. A lot of the logo ones are popular. Ones focusing on technology are quite popular with everybody that grew up in an analog world and has seen what has happened, and reflects and understands how mind-blowingly different the world is in such a short period of time. The technology ones resonate with people because they are so aware of it yet so involved with it. It’s sort of like an inner conflict. We hate and love technology so much.

<div id="collapseTwelve" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Yes, I think that’s why I like doing events and art festivals because I can overhear or see people and how they react to them and what they think of them. I think that gives me more useful insight into people than anything else. The way somebody interprets a piece of art, there are whole schools of thought on this: art therapy and art psychology. You can extrapolate a lot about them. I think it has really aided my learning of being in this country by seeing reactions to my work. I would love to have a camera in each piece of my art to see what people think. It makes me happy that I am spiking some intellectual discussion.

The worst thing is someone looking at a piece and having no opinion of it. That’s much worse to me. If someone looks at something and doesn’t get anything out of it, then I have failed. That’s how I look at it. If I do a piece and it doesn’t resonate with 95 percent of the people but it does resonate with the other five percent, that is still worthwhile. So I don’t beat myself up over it or second guess it too much. But I am always highly interested in which pieces people like and what people think they mean.

It didn’t take long for Recycled Propaganda to take off. Were you surprised by that?

</div>
<div id="collapseFourteen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I have been working fulltime on Recycled Propaganda for the last two years. I think once I figured out there’s a market for my work, and realized I really want to do this, and I like doing this, I just decided to do it rather than think it was a possibility. I am into those power of thought books and it’s totally true if your mind visualizes it than it becomes a reality. So, I just did that, I decided I wanted to do it and just kept working until it happened. 
Maybe the reason it wasn’t a thought is I think we are taught that certain professions aren’t professions. And I think art is one of those. If you were to say when you were growing up that you wanted to be artist, I would imagine most families would say, ‘what the fuck are you talking about?’ I think that is a real issue, if we zoom out on the current reality, a lot of jobs aren’t going to exist really soon because of automation and robotics. The one thing that I think a robot or computer system is going to have a harder time catching up on is truly creative thought and bridging stuff which is what the mind is good for and that’s why humans are so successful. We have to adapt, and adapting is just creativity.

How important is the idea of art and creativity to society? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFifteen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Moving forward in society and as a globe, art is probably one of the most important things and it’s still so underappreciated and underfunded and not even seen as a legitimate option. Not even art as in what I do, but creative thought in general is not very promoted that much in society. We are always just using one side of the brain to think in logical terms. That irony has to come to a point that education and everything we learn is so logic based and computers are so good at logic then why are we teaching kids logic? We need to teach them nonlogic or creative thinking. I have done some workshops with kids and kids are great because their creative mind hasn’t been squashed yet. So, generally, they are quite creative thinkers. I think there is a Picasso quote: “Everybody is an artist until they are taught not to be. I think that is very true.” I teach an art and wine class down at the Marriott two hours a week and to just see the general level of adults trying to create art is quite shocking to me. I say, ‘Yeah, you can paint it green or blue,’ and they have a nervous breakdown. I am like, ‘Whoa, it’s art, relax.’ Society thinks we have to have rules, steps and logic that we can’t just let loose. If we look at America, it’s successful because of innovation which is just creative thought. I think that sooner or later as a society we will recognize that.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many Nevada cultivators have just finished their first full summer harvest. Following such a huge accomplishment, many growers are reviewing how things went to see what they might do differently next year and how to better combat the cost of doing business in the unrelenting desert heat. With summer energy bills weighing in as a significant budgetary item, that&rsquo;s certainly one of the major costs to examine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cultivation facilities are now beginning to experience price pressure on their per-pound cost. The SunTrac system focuses on reducing air conditioning or HVAC system electrical usage which is one cost-saving fix that is both economically and environmentally beneficial,&rdquo; explains Rich Cooley, CEO of SunTrac USA, the manufacturer of SunTrac&rsquo;s Hybrid Climate Systems. &ldquo;SunTrac systems can assist in controlling monthly expenses to operate the grow facilities and extract significant value because when you are saving money on your electricity bill it drops straight to your bottom line.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>How does the SunTrac system work?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Rich Cooley: Suntrac Manufactures A Patented Hybrid Thermal Panel System That Is Engineered And Designed For Integration With Residential And Commercial Air Conditioning And Heating Systems. The Suntrac System Features Parabolic Mirrors That Generate And Harness Concentrated Solar Thermal Energy To Be The Perfect Blend Of Energy Efficiency And Renewable Energy Bundled Into One System.</p>
<p><strong>What is a solar thermal panel and how will it reduce the electrical use of an air conditioner?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;RC: A solar thermal panel collects the sun&rsquo;s abundant energy and uses the sun&rsquo;s thermal energy to heat liquids, gasses and other materials. SunTrac is NOT a solar electric system. SunTrac&rsquo;s solar panel is thermal and does a large portion of the HVAC unit compressor&rsquo;s job. HVAC compressors add heat and pressure to the refrigeration system. SunTrac&rsquo;s solar thermal panel does the same thing, but uses no energy compared to the compressor that uses a lot of energy. For an average air conditioner generating 4 to 7-1/2 tons of cooling, all you need is one SunTrac panel which measures 4-foot by 8-foot and does the work of up to 15 solar electric panels. The energy that SunTrac saves is the equivalent of what those 15 traditional solar panels generate and our system installed is well under $10,000. SunTrac systems are modular and expandable for HVAC systems from 5 tons up to 500+ tons.</p>
<p><strong>What is one of the biggest misconceptions about solar energy (thermal vs. electric)?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>RC: Everybody generally thinks all solar energy is either a solar water heater or it&rsquo;s solar electric panels that cover your roof. So, when they think about solar panels and air conditioners they think of dozens and dozens of panels, if not more, that generate electricity to power the air conditioner. There is a misconception that all solar is one of the two categories I mentioned. SunTrac is the first major firm to bring solar thermal in this particular application to market, which requires a small footprint to install, and is cost effective for virtually all HVAC systems.</p>
<p><strong>Is SunTrac compatible with existing heating/air units?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>RC: Yes, SunTrac works with both existing and new systems. There are a couple of basic requirements for a SunTrac system. Importantly, the HVAC system needs to be multi-stage, variable speed or variable capacity. For commercial units with one or more single speed compressors, SunTrac offers a variable speed upgrade kit so that a single speed package unit becomes a variable speed system that can work with a SunTrac system.</p>
<p><strong>Why is a SunTrac Hybrid Climate System ideal for a cannabis cultivation?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>RC: Using SunTrac and variable capacity equipment helps growers fine tune the cooling load as well as their humidity control so they can get precise heating, cooling and environmental control. While maintaining the proper environment for growing, cultivators also want to be able to control their operating costs. We help them save money and energy by reducing the amount of electricity their HVAC system uses. Between the electricity they use for lights as well as for their HVAC system, many growers are paying additional utility demand charges which happen in the afternoon and other peak times of energy usage. SunTrac generates the most thermal energy, providing the most efficiency, during the high heat times of the day year-round. We help grow houses avoid higher demand charges for energy spikes in the heat of the day especially in the desert Southwest. SunTrac helps when it hurts the most.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of cost savings can a grow facility expect when using a SunTrac system?</strong></p>
<p>RC: HVAC systems and air conditioners using SunTrac technology reduce their energy use by 25 to 40 percent, not only saving significant energy but also significant money. Additionally, the SunTrac system qualifies for a 30 percent federal tax credit and a five-year accelerated depreciation schedule. By using a SunTrac system, a grower can pay for his entire air conditioning system in a timeframe of seven to eight years on average. He or she will have regained all the capital they will have expended on their HVAC systems. SunTrac equipped air conditioning systems are the only HVAC systems that actually pay for themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What kind of effect does SunTrac have on a cultivation&rsquo;s carbon footprint?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>RC: SunTrac benefits customers because it saves them money on the electric costs of running their HVAC systems, but it also has a positive effect on the environment. For every 10,000 SunTrac thermal panels installed, we save over 39 million kilowatt hours of energy a year which equals 59 million lbs. of CO2 emissions. By displacing and reducing energy demand this, in turn, saves our customers an estimated $4 million dollars a year in electricity costs. The fact that SunTrac offers significant savings as well as reduces our carbon footprint is a big win for our customers and the environment.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Upside of Incorporating Cannabis into your Fitness Routine</strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>By Emily Willson </strong></p>
<p>As portrayed by Cheech and Chong and countless other stoner characters on the big screen, <br />marijuana users are often depicted as lazy and unmotivated with a less than favorable reputation for promoting fitness or exercise. This may soon be a thing of the past as legalization efforts spread and little by little <a href="http://www.awebtoknow.com/10-common-misconceptions-about-medical-marijuana/">misconceptions surrounding marijuana</a> are being corrected. An ever-growing number of athletes and exercise experts are looking to marijuana as an essential asset to the promotion of fitness and wellness.</p>
<p><strong>Marijuana &amp; Fitness go together like Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly </strong></p>
<p>Cannabis and fitness have a long history together. &ldquo;Yoga and cannabis have gone together for as long as yoga and cannabis have been around,&rdquo; says Bloom Farms founder Michael Ray. In fact, when sacred Hindu texts and yoga sutras mention a joyful &ldquo;herb,&rdquo; dedicated yoga practitioners suggest it&rsquo;s actually cannabis.</p>
<p>In marijuana legal states, there are plenty of exercise related endeavors that incorporate cannabis. Yoga classes have popped up that are specifically designed to incorporate marijuana, such as Ganja Yoga in San Francisco. Ski promoter Jim McAlpine launched the 420 Games, also in San Francisco, to promote healthy marijuana use while exercising. A cannabis gym, Power Plant Fitness, opened earlier this year in California where members are encouraged to use marijuana to fuel their workout and help raise their heart rates.</p>
<p><strong>Toking your Workout to the Next Level</strong></p>
<p>Cannabis is known to alleviate pain, decrease nausea, and improve mood. Therefore, it shouldn&rsquo;t be surprising to find marijuana being used by both recreational and hardcore athletes. These individuals face multi-hour grueling training regimens on a constant basis and have found that the use of marijuana aids in a much quicker recovery from daily workouts.</p>
<p>According to research, when marijuana enters the body a peak concentration of cannabinoids occurs within three to eight minutes after inhalation and 60-90 minutes after consuming an edible. The neural effects begin after 20 minutes and maximizes within a range of two to four hours, as noted in a study by J.P. Hartley, S.G. Nogrady, and A. Seaton in the <em>British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology</em>. <br />For many avid exercisers, cannabis offers a variety of benefits. Studies suggest marijuana can improve vision and concentration, help athletes with traumatic experiences, reduce muscle spasms, and aid in pain relief. Cannabis can increase impulsive responses, leading to more risk-taking behavior that can be beneficial in competitions.</p>
<p>Long-distance runners use it before races and yogis like it for getting into a deeper stretch. &ldquo;It gives them mental clarity, they see pain relief,&rdquo; explains Charles Blackton, creator of Super Lemon Haze, a potent strain of lemon-flavored marijuana known for its use by athletes.</p>
<p>For example, an endurance athlete might benefit from the pain-numbing effects of marijuana to aid them in getting through a tough training session. A mixed martial artist might use THC for its mix of effects that include pain relief, creativity and ability to concentrate. A triathlete might employ marijuana to stay focused on heart rate or pace as well as maintain motivation throughout a four-hour bike ride.</p>
<p>San Mill&aacute;n, the director of sports performance at the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado, Boulder</a>, suggests that marijuana can act as a great distraction and that often edibles or vaporizers help keep athletes in the zone.</p>
<p><strong>Munchies and Muscle Growth</strong></p>
<p>One of the essential aspects of muscle growth is proper nutrition. You need a regular diet that complements your muscle building goals. If you need to gain weight and have trouble building an appetite, marijuana may help with that goal. Using marijuana can also help to calm down and relax after stressful workouts. It can also induce deep sleep that is essential to restore muscle and help them grow.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that cannabis use stimulates appetite. This is <a href="https://www.livescience.com/24553-what-is-thc.html">caused by THC</a>, or tetrahydrocannabinol which is the psychoactive compound in cannabis. As any competitive athlete will tell you, in order to get stronger and recover faster, your body requires a lot of calories. Using marijuana can encourage appetite and keeping up with the amount of food your body requires for a strenuous workout regimen.</p>
<p><strong>Athletes Weigh In</strong></p>
<p>One of the trends in distance-running has been to incorporate cannabis. For example, <a href="https://www.outsideonline.com/1892281/ultramarathoner-jenn-shelton">ultra runners like Jenn Shelton</a> and Avery Collins have performed under the influence of marijuana. Also, Chris Barnicle, a former professional runner, often calls himself the &ldquo;world&rsquo;s fastest stoner&rdquo; on Twitter.</p>
<p>Tyler Hurst is a runner and cannabis enthusiast from Portland who has been using cannabis regularly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty great to run through a field, across a bridge, in a forest, or up a mountain, while being hyper-aware of your environment,&rdquo; Hurst says. In addition, cannabis helps relax his muscles when they become fatigued. This makes it easier to stretch and foam roll after each race. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve recovered faster in the past year than I ever have before, all while running longer and eating the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p><br /><em>Emily Willson is a marketing specialist at&nbsp;</em><a href="https://essencevegas.com/"><em>Essence Cannabis Dispensary</em></a><em>&nbsp;with a primary focus on development and implementation of marketing ideas in the categories of medical and recreational cannabis.&nbsp;</em><em><br /></em></p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>by Deborah L. Costella</h4>
<p><em>&ldquo;The Giving Tree&rdquo; is a children&rsquo;s story written by Shel Silverstein. A tale of unconditional love demonstrating, in simple yet beautiful prose, how pain, sorrow and joy are part and parcel of the give and take pendulum. It&rsquo;s about the relationship between </em><em>an apple tree and her beloved </em><em>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; a relationship akin to that of dogs and those who love and care for them. For dogs, I have learned, are much like giving trees</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>His mistreatment must have been particularly brutal during feedings, as it took years for him to eat from his food while anyone was present. He drank water in front of the humans, but never would he eat so much as a morsel if anyone was standing nearby. He quickly learned to fill up on water whenever it was available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a particularly nice spring day, a day when hummingbirds were sharing with one another at the feeders, a day when mother quails proudly strutted about the yard showing off their changelings, a day that offered promise and hope. A day so nice in fact, this young and not-so-carefree animal could no longer stand the confinement of his cage. He wanted out. He couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time he had been allowed out of his small metal housing to run, jump or play. He just lay, head resting on crossed front paws, watching the world pass by. Always confused and sad, for no matter how hard he tried to keep the mean man and meaner lady happy, they were always angry with him. He was always in trouble. Today, he made his decision.</p>
<p>After hours of crying, whining, biting and chewing, he finally managed to somehow break the latch and found himself standing on the outside of the cage, looking in. His crud-caked water bowl, dry as ever, offered nothing. No kibble was left in the turned over and cracked food bowl. Only bits and pieces scattered in the dirt, serving as a buffet for the ants. And his blanket? Staring at the one thing that gave him comfort after the beatings while providing companionship during the long lonely hours in his cage, well, dragging the blanket out just meant dragging the memories it held around with him. The dog backed away a few steps then looked around, casing the expansive yard he was rarely permitted to enjoy. A last-minute change of mind and a mad dash back to the cage he grabbed his torn and tattered blanket. Holding it tightly in his teeth, he frantically made his way out of the yard through a small hole under the fence. He was out.</p>
<p>Not knowing which direction would best secure his freedom, the dog ran as fast as his skinny and weakened legs could carry him, all the while, clenching his blankie between his teeth as though it were a shield. The barking and yelping of other nearby dogs caused only a momentary pause. Their frantic barking sounded as though they were yelling at him to keep going, to be the one dog to save himself thereby, saving them all. Unsure of his surroundings but instinctively knowing he had to get as far away from the old house as possible, he didn&rsquo;t waiver. He was incredibly thirsty, but he had long ago learned to deal with thirst that felt like pine needles on his tongue and down his throat. He courageously marched on unfettered by discomfort.</p>
<p>Finding himself on a street clear of muted colored cars and near-flat tires and far softer, greener lawns, he felt safer. This caused him to slow his gait so to better enjoy his surroundings. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; shouted a voice from a passing car. As the car reduced its speed, the frightened dog could hear a child through the open window. &ldquo;Look, it&rsquo;s a puppy carrying his own blanket!&rdquo; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s so cute,&rdquo; said another, higher pitched voice. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t look like he&rsquo;s wearing a collar!&rdquo; said the first voice again. &ldquo;Look at how skinny he is, poor little thing,&rdquo; murmured yet another voice.</p>
<p>Instead of running from the now stopped car, the dog stood, curious and innocent. Then, the back door opened, next thing he knew he had been picked up by a child and pulled into the car. The trembling puppy sat on the lap of the first voice as the higher pitched voice softly stroked him behind the ears. The lady in the front seat turned and passed back bits of a partially eaten ham and cheese sandwich. As hungry as he was, the puppy didn&rsquo;t dare take a bite.</p>
<p>Carefully and cautiously the boy, his sister, and their parents taught Franklin, as they dubbed him, to sit, wait, and how to walk on a leash. There was food at the same time each day and lots of water. Though food was abundant in this home and was without punishment, Franklin still consumed far more water than food. He played with the family regularly, was taken on walks every morning, and slept on a clean pillow big enough to give a Great Dane cozy-comfort. And the trees, so many giving trees. Franklin loved trees and they were everywhere in this new yard. There were trees that provided shade, trees that dropped apples and figs for Franklin and the children to eat and enjoy. Trees that sent big, crunchy leaves, gently falling to the grassy ground as gifts for Franklin and the children to play in. Big, beautiful giving trees.</p>
<p>Though it had been nearly three months since this family had rescued him and Franklin believed he had found his forever family, what he didn&rsquo;t know, was they were actively searching for a new home for him. There were already three other dogs in the household and that just didn&rsquo;t leave room for another, according to the mother.</p>
<p>Still a puppy, but with the wisdom and awareness that comes with intimate exposure to difficulties and hardship in life, Franklin left his new home and his loving family to live with a single lady. Her name was Rosamund; she had no children, no male companion and no other pets. While this new owner didn&rsquo;t beat Franklin as his original owners had, she was just as cruel in another way, neglect.</p>
<p>Franklin&rsquo;s new home didn&rsquo;t include a doggie door so he couldn&rsquo;t get in and out as needed. Rosamund worked long hours and traveled so she never took the time to put in a doggie-door. Worse, she never walked Franklin. He spent his long, lonely days in yet another barren back yard. There were no flowers, bushes or giving trees, only dirt, gravel and an exposed pad of concrete. Nothing to provide shade or refuge in the sweltering Las Vegas summers. <em>Where did the other family go?</em>, wondered Franklin. <em>What did I do to make them send me away?</em>, he thought pondering these questions for days, weeks, months, eventually years. Then one day it happened.</p>
<p>It was a scorching hot day in July when Franklin was unwittingly lured out of that desolate back yard. Not by anyone concerned about his well-being, rather by two bad guys who showed up to do bad things, yet inadvertently did something wonderful. Enticing the now full grown, black dog, without tags, not fixed and no longer able to discern good people from bad in his hunger for companionship, turned out to be a true gift, eventually. Franklin heeded their directions and the bits of steak they had armed themselves with, gleefully following them out from the back yard into the open world of the front yard. Turning around to see what they wanted him to do next, Franklin saw they were gone and they had closed the back gate, leaving him alone once again. He stood in his spot patiently and waited and waited. They never did come out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Franklin realized there was nothing else for him to do but walk. To walk away from the house and yard where he had spent the last ten years. Already hot and thirsty, Franklin made his way through the neighborhood. Hours later an elderly gentleman called out to him, looking as though he held a bowl of something in his hands. Franklin was dubious about approaching any more humans, so he turned and ran in the other direction. Now panting and hot, so hot the pain in his hips from years of sitting on hard concrete and solid dirt was almost too much to bear. Franklin didn&rsquo;t know what else to do, so he just kept walking.</p>
<p>A sense of the familiar washed over Franklin as he heard a vehicle slow down alongside him. There were no children in the backseat this time, only a single man. His voice was kind as he called out to Franklin, &ldquo;Here boy, come here, fella.&rdquo; Instead of bringing him into the truck to sit on his lap, the man swooped Franklin up and carried him in the back of the truck. There, Franklin was locked in a cage, alongside many other cages with many other dogs inside them. Oh no, was all Franklin could think.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We celebrated my birthday for only the second time. Though no one knows for certain how old I really am, the decision was made last year, to celebrate on July 4th, the day I was rescued by my new dad. I heard the lady they call, Nana, say I&rsquo;m about 13 years old, &ldquo;That would be 91 in dog years,&rdquo; she said. Yesterday&rsquo;s birthday party was the best one yet! We went to Auntie Sharon and Uncle Daniel&rsquo;s house where I played with my cousins Uli and Lincoln all day long. We ran up the stairs and we ran down the stairs. We jumped around, twisting and turning mid-air like gymnasts and trapeze artists. My hips bothered me a little, and Papa cautioned about me getting overly excited and having one of those seizures again, but his warning wasn&rsquo;t enough to stop the fun. We tousled and wrestled then drank water to our hearts&rsquo; content from the biggest water bowl I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The sun was blazing hot, and the water bowl was big enough for me and my cousins to drink from and play in while the humans cooked up mouthwatering foods on a round black thing they called a barbeque. As they finished cooking, Auntie announced it was time to go into the cool of the house.</p>
<p>After reassembling ourselves in the kitchen Papa got down on his haunches beside me. Nana walked over holding a plate in her hand. More steak? I was hopeful, I&rsquo;m always hopeful. Nope, it wasn&rsquo;t meat; instead it was a big bone. Bigger than the bones Nana makes for me. However, this bone had a fire stick stuck in it. Everyone was looking at me as they began singing a happy song. Papa kept petting me as he set down the plate with the dog bone. I had a bite, it was delicious! Oh, my gosh, so good. Almost as good as those bones Nana makes.</p>
<p>The rest of my celebration included lots of hugs, pats on the head and belly rubs. Not to mention hours more play time with my cousins. By dusk I finally collapsed on the rug at the feet of my dad. My hips were aching, my back hurt and I was exhausted. Exhausted but dog-gone happy.</p>
<p>As it turns out, that day so long ago, when I was picked up by the man in the truck and taken to doggie jail was the best thing that could&rsquo;ve happened to me. I was in that joint for three days, scared, cold, and isolated in my own cell. The other dogs inside said I was a gonner. Not fixed, I was old, black; no one was ever going to adopt me, and I believed them. I knew I had dodged fate twice already and it didn&rsquo;t seem possible I could get lucky a third time. But I did.</p>
<p>It was late afternoon of day three on the inside, when I heard his voice, &ldquo;Franklin! Franklin, are you in here buddy?&rdquo; It was the tall, skinny man with the beard. He cared for me sometimes when the lady, Rosamund, went away for long stretches of time. He always took me to his house. I loved it there. He walked me twice a day, talked to me, even got down on the floor and played with me. When he dog-sat me I got delicious food, not that cardboard Rosamund fed me. There was a different woman in his house. She&rsquo;s older like me. I can smell age and illness, she has a little of both. But she always cooked for me; eggs, meat, and some special bones she made at home. She and the man with the beard called them Cosmic Muffin Medicine Bones.</p>
<p>Not only did I enjoy companionship and great food when I was with them, there were plenty of giving trees in their back yard and the canyon below. Whenever I was at their house I felt as though I was staying at Club Med (for dogs). Yet, how can I be hearing the man&rsquo;s voice here, in this awful doggie-joint? The mix of scents and smells in here make it hard to discern if it&rsquo;s really him. <em>Could it be? Dare I hope?</em> Maybe I&rsquo;m having one of my doggie dreams. But I&rsquo;m usually running and happy in my dreams. I know I&rsquo;m not running and I&rsquo;m certainly not happy. I stop, I wait, I listen, I see him! I wasn&rsquo;t dreaming the man with the beard is here! He runs up the concrete walkway, past the other cages and barking dogs. He sits on the floor with me, just outside my cage reaching his fingers though the holes to pet me, best he can. His voice is soft and sad and happy at the same time. <br /> The man with the beard sat on that hard, cold floor until the man with all the keys on his belt came and let me out. I was led out on a rope they used in place of a leash. My legs wobbled and my hips ached more than ever. The man with the beard paid some money then together we walked outside. There in the car was the lady they call Nana. <br /> I was so excited to be free, but unsure what was going to happen next. <em>Were they taking me home? Where was my home anyway? Does Rosamund not want me anymore?</em><em>Not that I really want her, but where else can I go?</em> The man with the beard sat in the backseat with me the entire ride. It felt so good to hang my head outside the window. To breathe in the clean, fresh air, to drool openly and freely. Then the car turned onto a street I recognized. They weren&rsquo;t taking me to Rosamund. They were taking me to their house! As we pulled up and the man with beard opened the door, I did my best to scramble out of the car, but my legs gave way and I fell to the ground. My hips and back wouldn&rsquo;t work right, no matter how I tried to stand on my own. &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; I heard Nana say. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just carry him in,&rdquo; said the man. <br /> Inside Nana set out a soft, silky blanket as the man set me down on it, I thought of my old puppy blankie. Moments later there was one of those scrumptious medicine bones in front of me. The man with the beard said, &ldquo;Go on, buddy, eat it. It&rsquo;ll help you.&rdquo; I remembered these. Nana made them for me whenever the man with the beard dog-sat me. I&rsquo;m not sure how long after eating that bone it happened, but the pain in my hips and back began to ease. Before I knew it, I was fast asleep. I slept like the puppy I never was. <br /> The next day the man with the beard took me on a short walk. Then Nana fed me some new food, I had clean, cool water in a sparkling new bowl and another tasty bone like the one I was given yesterday. It&rsquo;s been a long time since the day I was rescued by the man with the beard, whom I now call, &ldquo;Papa.&rdquo; Papa says he didn&rsquo;t rescue me, rather I rescued him and just like his favorite storybook, &ldquo;The Giving Tree,&rdquo; we give to each other, unconditionally. As for my hips and back, the hair has pretty much rubbed off after years of sitting and lying on concrete and hard dirt, but whenever the pain is too much or I suffer the onset of a seizure, Nana has one of her special medicine bones ready for me. I may be old, but I am one happy dog.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Hunter Wilson of Growers Network interviews Susan Chicovsky, owner and CEO of </strong><a href="http://growersnetwork.org/"><strong>Green Mountain Harvest</strong></a><strong>, one of the oldest compliant hand-trim companies in Colorado, about using contract trimming companies to make the process of harvesting and trimming simpler on your team.</strong></p>
<h4><strong>Harvesting and Curing</strong></h4><p><strong>Could you explain how the harvesting and curing process works?</strong></p>
<p>I learned to harvest by first cutting down the whole plant and hanging it to dry indoors for a few days. After drying, it should be placed in an opaque glass jar and covered for 10-20 days to cure. After a few weeks, the plant&rsquo;s flavors have fully developed and the herb is ready.</p>
<p>Now having that said, curing in a glass jar isn&rsquo;t practical for the scale that cannabis is grown on. What most good growers will do instead is place the dried cannabis in a dark room that is temperature and humidity controlled so that it can cure slowly.</p>
<p><strong>What are some pitfalls when it comes to harvesting and curing?</strong><strong><br /></strong>Most of the problems surrounding harvesting and curing come up prior to the harvest:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 50px">
<li>If buds haven&rsquo;t finished forming, it takes longer to prepare the plant.</li>
<li>Poorly trained plants take longer to prepare.</li>
<li>Powdery mildew can show up prior to a harvest.</li>
</ul><br /><strong>What are businesses doing that they shouldn&rsquo;t be doing?</strong><strong><br /></strong>One of the current problems is that too few growers don&rsquo;t cure the cannabis long enough. They usually just chop it down and dry it. Customers will notice. The smoke is sharp and harsh. When the product is cured properly, the harsh elements tend to get removed.
<h4><strong>Trimming</strong></h4><p><strong>Take me through the trimming process.</strong><strong><br /></strong>We lay out the buds on our trimming table and cut off sugar leaves that are sticking out of the buds. Depending on the clients&rsquo; desires, we can cut the leaves really close to the bud, or a little further out. <br />Dried buds take longer because we have to be more gentle, as they are more likely to flake or break. Wet buds are strong and firm, so we can go at a much faster pace.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the difficulties running a harvesting and trimming service?</strong><strong><br /></strong>It&rsquo;s a tough industry. Turnover is high because of the nature of physical labor and we run very tight profit margins in order to stay compliant. <br />Illegal trimming companies skip lots of time and money-consuming steps in order to save money and run a better profit margin. This puts everyone at risk just for profit. And in the end, if we want to have a legal industry, we need to follow the rules like adults.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts about automated trimmers?</strong><strong><br /></strong>The first time I saw automated trimmers in the early 2010s, I thought they were pretty atrocious. We tested a few and saw cannabinoid levels drop by nearly half when we compared before and after.<br />Nowadays, there are some truly impressive automated trimmers out there. The most effective method for using these trimmers, in my opinion, is to let them do a basic run on the product, and our hand trimmers touch up the final product to make it excellent.</p>
<p><strong>What would be an ideal trimming and harvesting set up?</strong><strong><br /></strong>Just a few things, really:</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 50px">
<li>Clean tables. I prefer stainless steel tables, but aluminum is also good.</li>
<li>Comfortable chairs.</li>
<li>Great lighting.</li>
<li>Climate control in hot or cold environments.</li>
<li>A separate table to take weight measurements on.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Philosophy</strong></h4><p><strong>Trimming can be a high turnover business. Is that an issue for you?</strong><br />The work can be really tough for someone who is new to the industry and doesn&rsquo;t know what they&rsquo;re getting into. We do our best to train individuals on different trimming techniques that suit different clients&rsquo; needs.</p>
<p><br /><strong>What are some trimming bad behaviors businesses engage in?</strong><br />The most import one is sanitation. Some of our past clients didn&rsquo;t have clean tables to work on. We definitely wouldn&rsquo;t eat on their tables, so why were we preparing &ldquo;medical&rdquo; products on them? There were also some past clients who left open bottles of pesticides laying around the trimming room.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[University of Florida Health’s Dr. Robert Cook is lead investigator of a study starting in January that will look at the health effects of cannabis on people with HIV as well as its potential as an alternative to addictive opioids. Awarded a $3.2 million R01 grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), Dr. Cook and his team will conduct a study of 400 persons living with HIV infection to identify relationships between marijuana consumption and control of HIV symptoms, HIV viral suppression, markers of chronic inflammation, and cognitive or behavioral aspects of health.

Florida has the third-highest number of residents living with HIV infection in the U.S., according to a 2015 study conducted by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Was that a factor in why you developed this study?  </a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseOne" class="panel-collapse collapse in">
<div class="panel-body">
Fifty percent of people with HIV in Florida are now 50 years old or more. So, we have a lot of older people who currently use marijuana or who are thinking about it. And we don’t have a lot of information on what happens to people over age 50.

What was the impetus for you to study the effects of cannabis on HIV? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

As a clinician, I have seen a lot of patients who seem interested in trying medical marijuana for a variety of conditions. I was looking for some data to support which kinds of marijuana might be more beneficial than others and I couldn’t find any evidence so I decided we really needed to do some type of study.

Had you researched cannabis before you decided to do this study? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

In the last couple of years, we have been doing some research looking at marijuana and its effects on cognitive function. We have also been looking at marijuana use in HIV viral suppression and we have been looking at a few other things but most of this is limited because all we know about people is: Do you use any marijuana; and if so, how often? So, we can compare people who report daily use vs. non-daily use. We were frustrated by how limited information about how people use marijuana was in the current research. For our study we are going to try to ask a lot more questions about what kind they use; do they get it from a dispensary or not; do they ingest it or smoke it or vape it? We are going to do a urine toxicology to try and figure out if what they use has any of the cannabinoids in it or if it’s only THC. I think there’s a lot of medical interest around the CBD part. It does seem like what’s available to purchase is mostly THC products and the CBD stuff costs more. I would like to be able to tell patients if this is worth it. We need to have data to show if you do have a CBD product that it is better for pain and things like that. Those are the types of questions that I think we need more data on but have been hard to study because marijuana is illegal at the federal level. It’s very hard for researchers to directly study it. One of the biggest limitations of the research we are going to do is that it is going to be reported by the participants themselves. Even though we are going to do this urine screen to see whether there’s THC or not, we still aren’t directly controlling what people use or don’t use. It’s all based on their reporting.

As you begin the study, what is your hypothesis for medicinal cannabis and HIV?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I do believe that people who are getting effective relief from pain, for example, will be using it slightly differently than those who don’t get effective relief from pain. I suspect the CBD part is important, but I don’t have a lot of data to prove it. And I am interested in comparing some of the side effects of people are who are using products that are either long-lasting or that they use several times a day compared to people who use marijuana intermittently. Because even with that I wonder as a physician should we be encouraging people to just dose it all day long versus use as needed. There is an endocannabinoid system in our bodies that’s natural and it may react differently when people are constantly being exposed versus intermittent and I am not sure yet which is better.

Many HIV patients take cannabis to help with sleep, pain and stress, do you believe any other useful information will come out of this study such as aiding HIV’s viral suppression?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It’s very challenging to really prove whether it is helping or not in terms of things like anxiety and stress because we are enrolling people in our study who are already using it for anxiety and stress because you really don’t know what their level would be if they weren’t using it. People may perceive that’s helping but we really don’t know. I hope I get some people in the study who haven’t used marijuana before and they begin to use, because it’s now legal to prescribe it for people with HIV in Florida, so that will be interesting to see what happens to people when they haven’t used it before and now they start. We are also especially interested in inflammatory markers. HIV virus, if it’s unsuppressed, does cause chronic inflammation in the body and thatis usually associated with more rapid aging, more rapid progression of heart disease, and probably feeling fatigued and tired. If marijuana could suppress some of that chronic inflammation or at least some parts of marijuana, it really could help people with a chronic virus feel better. We do suspect that many people truly do feel better with it and I suspect it’s because of its relationship to inflammation. But most of the data we have so far is short-term studies, which are helpful, but we will be looking at a longer view, over several years and that will be something different about our study over previous studies.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Science is an animal project, you can control everything except for the marijuana and learn a lot. But in real life our participants, in addition to having different marijuana patterns, also do have different patterns of other substance use, different medical comorbidities, and different experiences of stress and abuses in their lives. It can be hard to tease out an effect with all this variation but at the same time that’s the real world. People living with HIV in Florida do have many medical conditions like high blood pressure, diabetes, depression and so we want to know if it’s safe to use in these types of people with lots of health issues.

UF Health researchers applied for the NIDA grant twice before receiving it. How many years have you been trying to get this study in place? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

At least two years. This is kind of a common story with National Institutes of Health-funded research. Usually you have to be in the top ten percent of grants to get it and those often take several tries where you get feedback from other scientists who make suggestions on how to improve the science and I tried to be responsive to their suggestions. For example, they did think we should focus a little bit more on pain and pain medication so we tried to adapt the study to that.

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

You would have to ask NIH, but I do think our grant was funded in part because there are so few studies trying to gain scientific evidence on marijuana and any type of chronic health issue. HIV is one, but they might be interested in other types of conditions people might use it for. We have very little information and so there was a perception in the past that NIH was more interested in marijuana as a drug of abuse and not so much on its health effects. But I do think that attitude has shifted a lot in the last ten years where NIH is open to both and looking at it as a drug that could be beneficial while also it could still have harms associated with it.

With the $3.2 million grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, you are in a very elite group, researchers who have been given a federal grant to study cannabis, did you think you would get federal funding? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

That’s what I have been trained to do for my academic career. They train us to write grants and as you gain more experience as a scientist you learn to write better grants and you get feedback that helps you to be a better scientist. I was optimistic that we had a good chance to get funded, otherwise, I don’t think we would try but it is a competitive process and certainly takes a team of scientists, and I have a great team with a lot of different areas of expertise and I think that helps. There is just a need for research. 
I do hope over the next several years the information that we get will be helpful. It’s important to me that the data we collect ultimately will help to guide patients who might benefit, to guide people who might be vulnerable to harm, to guide providers, at least in Florida, who are specifically recommending doses and types and writing prescriptions which is different than what I think is happening in many other states in which people can get a license and the clinical recommendations are made by the people working at the dispensaries. 
I should note that the people working at the dispensaries often seem to have an incredible abundance of knowledge about the medical effects. So how do we translate what they seem to know to data that’s more typically required in order to practice medicine in the U.S.? We don’t just want anecdotal reports or personal experience, we want harder data. It does seem like people know a lot of information out there and I want to try and translate some of what they know into more typical health data. Our research can influence practice guidelines and things as simple as do sativa products truly cause people to feel more alert and creative? Do indica products cause people to really be more laid back and sedate? And is that the same in people who are older than 50? Those are the type of things I would want, as a provider, to know and make suggestions as to which product a patient should try.

<div class="panel-body">

We have to be really careful about confidentially, when you do this type of research we have staff that we train, but staff can make mistakes. We have to do our best to ensure that people aren’t outed as being HIV positive or that people aren’t outed because they are marijuana users. There is a lot of need for researchers to make it safe for people to participate.

What about cannabis being federally illegal? 

</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTwelve" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

People are worried at the University that we could lose federal funding because it is involved in research that is federally illegal. When the political administration is stating pretty clearly they aren’t going to tolerate a lot of marijuana activity and that’s the public stance, we need to be cautious. As a researcher I am not applying to have marijuana onsite. We do have the potential to work with the dispensaries themselves and let them dispense the products which they can do legally and collaborate with them as scientists to try and do some clinical studies. That’s something I am interested in, in the next year or two, to really figure out a way where we can try to randomly assign people who are willing to participate in a different study with product A vs. product B, or product A that’s consumed orally vs. inhaled and see if we can get some clinical evidence both in terms of people’s perceived symptoms, which is important, but also any biological measures like inflammatory markers. Ultimately, I do hope we generate some data that can be helpful for consumers and providers.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>Photography by Mike Rosati</h4>
<p>American Green has hit the lottery. Literally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The publicly-traded cannabis company purchased the town of Nipton, an unincorporated community in San Bernardino County, California, just 10 minutes from Primm, Nevada, in August for $5 million. As one of the closest California locations where Nevadans can purchase lottery tickets, not only does this nip of a town house a lotto stop inside its Trading Post, it is also being positioned to become the country&rsquo;s first energy-independent, cannabis-friendly hospitality destination.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s serendipitous timing, too, which surely was not lost on American Green. California becomes a recreationally legal marijuana state on January 1st. With the Nipton exit located just two minutes from Nevada&rsquo;s border and approximately an hour from Las Vegas, cannabists and tourists have a new place to hike, bike, explore, and enjoy the wonders of weed in a charming Old West setting surrounded by giant eucalyptus trees, fragrant oleander bushes, and an abundance of Joshua trees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With over 120 acres of land for development that sit at the northeast entrance to the Mojave National Preserve, American Green will eventually be transforming Nipton into a base for potentially producing various cannabis-based products as well as housing licensed cultivation, edible and extraction facilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As various California jurisdictions begin the process of regulating recreational cannabis use next month, American Green will be busy turning Nipton into a hospitality hub for those who want to experience their own brand of American green.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just happen to say welcome,&rdquo; explained American Green&rsquo;s Stephen Shearin, general manager for the Nipton project, of the tiny town&rsquo;s guests being able to use cannabis on private property. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not many towns where you can walk through and people invite you into a private area and say you are free to recreate or medicate as you see fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being a part of this century&rsquo;s green rush is a concept Nipton is not unfamiliar with. Having been a mining town at the turn of the last century, Nipton is well positioned to be part of the next gold rush. &ldquo;The cannabis revolution that&rsquo;s going on here in the U.S. has the power to completely revitalize communities in the same way gold did during the 19th century,&rdquo; said David Gwyther, chairman and president of American Green.</p>
<p><strong>THE BIRTH OF A RAILWAY TOWN</strong></p>
<p>Modern day Nipton hasn&rsquo;t transformed all that much from its origins as a sleepy desert town out among the Joshua trees, desert tortoises, and inky-black night skies. On January 1, 1900, a gold seeker from Pennsylvania named S.D. Karns staked, perhaps, the earliest claim in the area, calling it Nippeno, according to the National Park Service. Miners took up residence at the crossroads, which became known as Nippeno Camp, following a nearby discovery of gold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Evolving into a railway town, Nipton was founded on February 9, 1905, with the coming of the first train on the newly constructed San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad. Nevada Senator William Clark was determined to connect the cities by rail, which made the community relevant as supplies arrived and it became a cattle-loading station for several local ranches shipping livestock to Salt Lake and Los Angeles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tiny town and depot also supplied numerous mines in the area, becoming a social center for the region&rsquo;s sparse population. In 1910, the line was merged into the Union Pacific Railroad and the name changed from Nippeno to Nipton, according to the National Park Service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soon, the town boasted a railroad station, hotel, and stagecoach stop. English immigrant Harry Trehearne shepherded the town&rsquo;s development through the 1940s. After his death and the closing of the railway station, the town went into decades of decline and the railway station was abandoned in the 1950s.</p>
<p><strong>A PART OF HOLLYWOOD LORE&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Although the town looks more like the kind of place &ldquo;Gunsmoke&rsquo;s&rdquo; Miss Kitty would have frequented, it was actually well before her time that Nipton found itself basking in Hollywood&rsquo;s limelight. One of Hotel Nipton&rsquo;s frequent guests during the late &lsquo;20s and &lsquo;30s, according to the National Park Service, was famed &ldquo;It&rdquo; girl Clara Bow of the silent film era. Bow was dubbed "The 'It' Girl" after her turn as Betty Lou Spence, a poor shop girl who conquers the heart of her employer Cyrus Waltham (Antonio Moreno), in Paramount&rsquo;s 1927 &ldquo;It&rdquo; film.</p>
<p>Bow and her husband, Western movie star Rex Bell, bought Walking Box Ranch, which is just up the road from Nipton, as a retreat from the pressures of Hollywood, living there after marrying in December 1931. Calling Walking Box Ranch her "desert paradise," Bow retired from acting and became a Nevada rancher and she and Bell, who went on <br />to become the 21st Lieutenant Governor of Nevada, raised two sons.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>VISIONS OF ECO-GRANDEUR&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In the 1950s, Nipton attracted the interest of Los Angeles-based geologist Gerald Freeman who was investing in gold mines in the area. &ldquo;I always felt comfortable in the desert where I had a lot of space. &hellip;Los Angeles was becoming too costly and too crowded,&rdquo; Freeman told the <em>Las Vegas Review-Journal</em> in January 2016 of his decision to buy the town in 1984. A 2011 <em>Los Angeles Times</em> article reported Freeman paid $200,000 for Nipton.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Endeavoring to create a desert ecotopia, Freeman and his wife, Roxanne Lang, told the <em>LVRJ</em> they invested more than $1 million dollars in the property over the years. They added environmentally-friendly amenities that include a photovoltaic solar array that provides the town with nearly half its power, four ecolodge tented cabins, and a recreational vehicle park. One of the most valuable natural amenities that came with the place includes access to the sweet waters of the Pleistocene-era lake below its surface.</p>
<p>Hoping to build everything necessary for a self-sustaining community, Freeman told <em>Sunset</em> magazine during an interview published earlier this year, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to move forward in the direction I&rsquo;m going. That heritage, that legacy, that thrust that began with the first settlers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Freeman passed away last year and never got to see his dream come to fruition.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BLAZE, LAZE &amp; GAZE&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Although gone in body, the spirit of Freeman&rsquo;s dream lives on with American Green&rsquo;s purchase of the town this past summer. &ldquo;We are trying to keep that ecofriendly side. We really want to figure out how to do that. Our goal is to be self-sufficient in a year,&rdquo; explains Freddie Wyatt, president of Munch &amp; Company, American Green&rsquo;s hospitality partner.&ldquo;Everything we can use within the hemp space will be on property such as hempcrete, we are planning to use it throughout the property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Munch &amp; Company have plenty of space and opportunity to continue as an ecotopia. At this point the town consists of a general store/trading post, 44-seat <br />saloon called the Whistlestop Cafe, 35-slot RV park, campgrounds, four one-bedroom eco cabins with woodstoves and swamp coolers, a schoolhouse, a greenhouse that has been transitioned into a bathhouse <br />for campers, and two small homes.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, Wyatt and his team have refreshed existing buildings by installing new floors and replaced d&eacute;cor materials. They have also reconfigured the general store into a co-op market and refurbished the five-room Hotel Nipton, which was built between 1904 and 1910 in a Mexican Territorial style, and now operates as a bed and breakfast that he calls the &ldquo;Marriott of marijuana.&rdquo; Refurbishment of the tiny town is just phase one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Citing Mexico&rsquo;s Zen destination of Tulum as a model, Nipton&rsquo;s developers have big plans for phase two of the desert cannatopia. Working off a three-year timeline, coming attractions include an observation deck, Serenity health and wellness spa, Surveyor martini bar, Pioneer whiskey bar, Nomad hookah lounge, art sculpture park and gallery, and conversion of the 3,000-square-foot schoolhouse into a community center for yoga. Also, seven ponds, some with CBD-infused water, will be created that feed off the sweet water aquifer on the property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wyatt also mentioned even higher visions such as building a planetarium. &ldquo;Our dreams are to build an event center that holds 3,000 to 5,000 people under the stars. I want to do something like the Pink Floyd laser show at Griffith Park&rsquo;s Planetarium. We could do one of those off the mountains, shoot a laser and have it hit the mountains. Our best asset is that we have this amazing valley of nature,&rdquo; Wyatt said. &ldquo;We want to do CBD massage, canna-yoga, mountain biking tours...there&rsquo;s so many different aspects <br />of what we want to put our arms around. We want to do <br />art curation in a largescale space but don&rsquo;t want to affect <br />the view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, he cautions, &ldquo;This really needs to be organic, we can&rsquo;t throw a party for 5,000 people because we don&rsquo;t know what we would do with 5,000 people. This is a marathon not <br />a sprint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A marathon with a jackpot at the finish line.&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>By Justin Alexander</h4>

And there&rsquo;s most definitely something for everyone on your list. For the beauty maven who loves her potions and elixirs, consider cannabis-based topical creams, lotions, salves, or lip balms. For the foodie, pick up some infused goodies such as honey, dried fruit, olive oil or even a sweet treat of gummies, cookies or chocolate bars. As for the cannabis lover, there&rsquo;s no end of choices from flower and pre-rolls to vape pens and concentrates. Just find out if they prefer an indica or sativa. If you aren&rsquo;t sure, a hybrid is always a safe bet. To follow are some selections from the Nevada marketplace that will give you a general idea of what you will find as you begin your hunt for the perfect holiday gift.</p>
<img class="alignleft size-medium" style="margin-top: 30px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/StackedDeckE3DG.jpg" alt="COLORADO: Elevate your state" />
<p><strong>Stacked Deck Limited Edition Pre-Rolls by Redwood</strong></p>
<p>For the classic smoker on your list, you will ace gift giving this year with Stacked Deck pre-rolls from Redwood. For those who love the simplicity of sparking one up, go all in with Redwood&rsquo;s Stacked Deck pre-rolls, which come in packaging that resembles a deck of cards. Different strains are available as well as mix packs for a full house of flavor, so it comes as no surprise that this is a top gift item for cannabis lovers during holiday 2017. The novel and clever presentation will bring a smile to the receiver&rsquo;s face before it is even cracked open. Once this premium bud is lit up, the good times continue to roll back to whatever era you fancy. If you are over 50 you will appreciate the humor and nostalgia, if you are younger, embrace the vintage, retro vibes of this unique offering.</p>
<img class="alignleft size-medium" style="margin-top: 30px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Peppermint_Chocolates_9_preview.jpeg" alt="COLORADO: Elevate your state" />
<p><strong>Kynd Cannabis Company</strong><strong>&rsquo;s Peppermint Chocolate</strong></p>
<p>Like eggnog and gingerbread cookies, the taste of peppermint is a holiday staple. As is chocolate, which always makes a great gift especially when you add THC oil into the mix making for a happy ho-ho-ho holiday indeed. Kynd Peppermint Chocolates&mdash;a seasonal offering&mdash;come in a convenient dosing pack of four squares with 11.1mg THC per square. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t doubt it&rsquo;s going to take the market by storm,&rdquo; says Kynd&rsquo;s chief operating officer Stacy Castillo of this latest release, which is a product of Kynd&rsquo;s collaboration with a local chocolatier that started in 2016. Dark chocolate in conjunction with crunchy peppermint candy combine for a taste that is as mellow as the relaxing high, but without couchlock. Kynd&rsquo;s peppermint chocolates are so tasty it might be hard to eat just one, but remember to start slow as the effects come on gradually and last longer than smoking.&nbsp;</p>
<img class="alignleft size-medium" style="margin-top: 30px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Kabunky-Kreme.jpg" alt="COLORADO: Elevate your state" />
<p><strong>Kabunky Kreme</strong></p>
<p>Body creams make great stocking stuffers for everyone on your list since they have so many applications. Made with extracted cannabis lipids, it is best to only use small amounts of Kabunky Kreme during each application as it is high in THC unlike many of the CBD-rich creams on the market. Kabunky Kreme has 763mg of THC per bottle and 310mg of CBD. While Kabunky does not call out particular genetics that go into this delightfully effective elixir&mdash;the biproducts from various plants are used for healing to create a soothing effect. It has a wide array of uses and applications and is recommended for burns, cuts, muscle aches, back pain, arthritis and more, as well as for those who suffer from lower back pain.</p>
<img class="alignleft size-medium" style="margin-top: 30px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Vert-Squares-Red-Velevet2_JWP.jpg" alt="COLORADO: Elevate your state" />
<p><strong>Vert</strong><strong>&rsquo;s Red Velvet Cookie Square</strong></p>
<p>Designed to be gifted without wrapping because of its pleasing packaging, Vert wants to change the way people view cannabis-infused foods. &ldquo;As a Las Vegas company, edible brand presentation and flavor are extremely important to us,&rdquo; says Margaux Hansberry, Vert account executive. &ldquo;Many people tend to shy away from edibles due to a negative experience they may have had from a home baked marijuana brownie back in the day. We set out to redefine that experience with a homogenized edible made for the consumer to both feed their mind and savor the flavor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Made with Chunky Diesel oil&mdash;Organa Labs certified triple refined oil with amazing taste and potency&mdash;the Red Velvet Cookie Square has 8mg of CBG, or cannabigerol, a non-intoxicating cannabinoid. &ldquo;The genetic parents are Deep Chunk and Sour Diesel, which account for the high amount of CBG because the latter is the parent for several strains that characteristically help relieve temple pressure such as Headband and Sour Kush, also an effect of CBG,&rdquo; Hansberry says, who notes the presence of CBG is good for Glaucoma sufferers as it decreases ocular pressure.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve got someone on your list who could use a good night&rsquo;s sleep, the Red Velvet Cookie Square will delight insomniacs. It is also perfect for those who love this trendy holiday flavor. Chef Melissa Parks, who creates all the recipes, is an expert at masking any cannabis taste. &ldquo;Melissa has taken into account every variable that could potentially affect cannabinoid/terpene burnoff rates and consistent dosages in our products,&rdquo; Hansberry says.</p>
<img class="alignleft size-medium" style="margin-top: 30px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Cannabiotix.jpg" alt="COLORADO: Elevate your state" />
<p><strong>Cannabiotix</strong><strong>&rsquo;s Mandarin Mint flower</strong></p>
<p>While edibles make a merry addition to a gift basket during the holidays, don&rsquo;t underestimate the happiness a jar of premium flower can also bring at this time of year. Guaranteed you will be on the top of everyone&rsquo;s party invite list when it gets around that you are gifting strains of Cannabiotix. The in-house breed of Orange Crush and Thin Mint Cookies, Mandarin Mint sounds as refreshing as the way it smokes. A potent indica-leaning hybrid, both of its parents are award winners. At 24 to 27 percent THC, Mandarin Mint is recommended for those with chronic pain, loss of appetite and anxiety. It will also relieve those holiday party hangovers and put you out for the night for much needed R&amp;R. The first thing that you will notice is its frosty appearance (like the snowman himself!), with crystal covered flowers and dense pods filled with bursts of violet and orange. The next powerful characteristic is the smell: think along the lines of a pungent cheese platter with candied nuts. These are all the things you will fall in love with even before you smoke its smoothness. Make sure whoever you gift this to likes to share.</p>
<img class="alignleft size-medium" style="margin-top: 30px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/EO4.jpg" alt="COLORADO: Elevate your state" />
<p><strong>Evergreen Organix Cookies, The+Source&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Evergreen Organix has introduced their holiday-inspired line of cookies including their cookie of the month, pumpkin pecan toffee (9.65 THC/2.64 CBG). With a texture that is gooey and crumbly, these soft, fresh, baked cannabis-infused cookies are individually packaged and make a great gift for the edible lover on your gifting list. Other flavors from Evergreen carried by The+Source include snickerdoodle, peanut butter, chocolate chip cookie, and, of course, brownies. A great present to both give and receive, they are low in dosage and work for just about everyone, including newbies. To control potency while at the same time sharing the love, Evergreen&rsquo;s cookies can also be cut into fractions. Evergreen lists the strain they use so it is never a &ldquo;take a bite and wait and see&rdquo; process&mdash;indica, sativa or hybrid effects are guaranteed.</p>
<img class="alignleft size-medium" style="margin-top: 30px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Tikun-set.jpg" alt="COLORADO: Elevate your state" />
<p><strong>Tikun Olam </strong><strong><br /></strong><strong>Topical Cream</strong></p>
<p>Creams offer an easy, user-friendly way to find relief from pain. Cannabis-infused topicals are completely non-threatening because, in most cases, they are CBD (cannabidiol) dominant. Tikun Olam not only has a CBD-rich cream, but has also developed three additional topicals using other cannabinoids geared toward specific patient needs. &ldquo;Each of the Tikun creams are made with extracts from their namesake plant,&rdquo; explains Chris Kelly, Tikun&rsquo;s head of operations for Nevada. &ldquo;Alaska is our THC cream that&rsquo;s great for pain relief, Midnight works for pain and inflammation, and Avidekel is a CBD cream used mostly for inflammation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Kelly, arthritis sufferers can rub cannabis-infused cream onto their hands and in about 3 to 10 minutes their pain and soreness could be gone. Same goes for those patients with psoriasis. Then there are just good ole aches and pains due to aging that topicals help with. &ldquo;In my 45 years I have been pretty hard on my body, from old Army injuries to the ones that come from fueling my weekend adrenaline addiction,&rdquo; explains Kelly. &ldquo;My personal go-to is the Midnight. After a paintball tournament, day of snowboarding, or an intense gym workout, it is literally a game-changer for me. We only get so many days to play <br />and when your body is feeling your weekend decisions <br />and you need to get back to work, Midnight Cream comes to the rescue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the best features of Tikun&rsquo;s topical creams are that they have no oily residue or unpleasant smell&mdash;its odor is neutral and every whiff is calmingly fresh. But the greatest testament is, of course, in the jar.</p>
<img class="alignleft size-medium" style="margin-top: 30px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/KIVASOLOELEVATE.jpg" alt="COLORADO: Elevate your state" />
<p><strong>Kiva</strong><strong>&rsquo;s Blackberry Dark Chocolate Bar</strong></p>
<p>Tired of bringing a bottle of wine or champagne as your signature holiday-party host present? Given individually or added to a basket full of infused goodies, Kiva Confections&rsquo; artisanal chocolate products made from premium-grade cannabis extract make a great hostess gift. Cannasseurs love them and so do beginners because of the rich taste with very little weed flavor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiva Bars will be especially appreciated by anyone who can benefit from cannabis' calming, relaxing and uplifting properties,&rdquo; says Christie Strong, KIVA's marketing communications manager. &ldquo;In the [two-and-a-half years I have worked for the company I&rsquo;ve had] time try every flavor of Kiva Bars. I really appreciate the consistency of our products because it means that there is a reliability to the experience I'm going to have on them. I know my dose for a night out with my friends, and I know my dose for a cozy night on the couch with my husband watching Netflix. Consistency takes all the guesswork out and puts me in control of my experience. I'm also a bit of a dark chocolate addict&mdash;and I think our bars taste as good as any unmedicated treats out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Segmented to suit a variety of tolerance levels, there are six flavors available in Nevada in both milk and dark chocolate measuring almost 100mg of THC per bar. (Always start at a 5mg dose and wait two hours before consuming more.) Bars have a combination of sativa and indica strains and produce a variety of effects from body highs to head highs, all focused on relaxation. Effects will start to happen anywhere from 45 minutes to one hour and their intensity varies from person to person.</p>
<img class="alignleft size-medium" style="margin-top: 30px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Medizins-Chloe.jpg" alt="COLORADO: Elevate your state" />
<p><strong>Medizin</strong><strong>&rsquo;s Chloe flower</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Many people gift this strain because they are so excited about its effects and consistent quality of having a great mix of terpenes and mid- to high 20s in THC,&rdquo; says Dave Farris, general manager of Medizin, of the Chloe strain. Perfect for both indica and sativa lovers, Chloe has hybrid qualities that make it appealing across the board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many people who smoke only indicas find solace in Chloe due to its calm sativa buzz and pain relief,&rdquo; Farris says. &ldquo;Even though this strain leans sativa-dominant, it possesses potency and physical sedation that can lull the most experienced person to sleep with continued consumption. Chloe is also a welcome companion for patients seeking relief from a wide variety of ailments, including loss of appetite and chronic pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This flower smokes smooth and engulfs with the same mellow luster after consumption. Following a long day of work, it will erase every trouble and worry without knocking you out as well as produce a range of euphoric and creative thoughts at 26.70 percent THC, .113 percent CBD, and .511 percent CBN. It&rsquo;s pleasant and even all the way around, kind of like the first day of your holiday vacation.</p>
<img class="alignleft size-medium" style="margin-top: 30px;" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/CityTrees.jpg" alt="COLORADO: Elevate your state" />
<p><strong>City Trees Calm Disposable Vape Pen&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For those searching for calming relief from the stress the holidays bring with them, a disposable CBD vape pen is the perfect call. Just the right amount of CBD isolated from Colorado grown hemp and pure THC distillate come together in a slim-lined vape that doesn&rsquo;t require a button or any accessories to enjoy.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2013, CNN&rsquo;s Dr. Sanjay Gupta alerted the world to cannabidiol (CBD) and its anti-seizure effects for epilepsy patients in his documentary &ldquo;Weed.&rdquo; In 2018 the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is about to make CBD into a household name. Starting January 1, WADA is removing CBD from its banned substances list, allowing athletes to use the cannabis compound which offers relief from inflammation, pain, anxiety, psychosis, seizures, and spasms without risk of league suspension or loss of sponsors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With all the curative benefits it would seem common sense to remove CBD from WADA&rsquo;s prohibited substances list. Although professional athletes will tell you the pressure was on, WADA says it happened as a result of intense study and research.</p>
<p>Michael Backes, author of &ldquo;Cannabis Pharmacy,&rdquo; sees WADA&rsquo;s policy change as somewhat of a no-brainer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not performance enhancing, it&rsquo;s performance enabling,&rdquo; he offers of CBD with a small chuckle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a great recovery drug for athletic endeavors and it may have significant neural protection capabilities for contact sports and so I think it&rsquo;s just a smart move that just shows somebody is actually practicing medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Kent Crowley is not so sure research had anything to do with it. &ldquo;They are getting so much pressure from athletes saying, &lsquo;Why are you loading me up with all these fucking drugs?&rsquo;,&rdquo; he says, noting that&rsquo;s the wording he hears from the pro athletes he helps to manage with regards to their healthcare.</p>
<p><strong>WADA, WADA, WADA</strong></p>
<p>At the start of each year WADA begins its annual review in January and releases its prohibited list of banned substances in September. &ldquo;Annually, the Prohibited List review involves a very extensive stakeholder consultation process over the course of nine months,&rdquo; said Director General Olivier Niggli in his official statement on September 29, 2017. &ldquo;In reviewing the List, experts examine such sources as: scientific and medical research; trends; and, intelligence gathered from law enforcement and pharmaceutical companies in order to stay ahead of those that endeavor to cheat the system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to a WADA spokesperson, the list is harmonized across all sports and a substance may be considered for inclusion if it meets two of the following three criteria: it has the potential to enhance sport performance; it represents a health risk to the athletes; and it violates the spirit of sport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In developing the list each year, WADA noted &ldquo;that the List is not static but evolves based on new scientific evidence; therefore, WADA maintains dialogue with athletes, administrators, scientific experts and other stakeholders and closely follows the literature in this area to obtain new evidence and information as it becomes available.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jeff Novitzky, Ultimate Fighting Championship&rsquo;s (UFC) Vice President of Athlete Health and Performance, was not surprised that WADA changed their policy on CBD &ldquo;because they are reasonable, they have scientists that look at these issues and they have to realize that CBD doesn&rsquo;t fit under any of these guidelines that we have. The only reason you would be prohibiting CBD would because of a moral issue and I think they realized they aren&rsquo;t trying to be the moral police here. They are looking at performance enhancing benefits and health and safety issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Formerly a U.S. federal agent for two decades, Novitzky joined the UFC two years ago to oversee its drug testing program. He sees WADA&rsquo;s move as a positive development as most UFC athletes are already using CBD. &ldquo;Right now, as it stands, we advise most of our athletes if they do use CBD, to discontinue using it during fight week to make sure there is none in their system during an in-competition test. But beginning January 1, 2018 there won&rsquo;t be a need for that, they won&rsquo;t have to worry about that at all,&rdquo; says Novitzky, who notes the most common question he gets from UFC athletes has to do with the use of CBD and cannabis.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s probably because WADA hasn&rsquo;t completely banned THC, cannabis&rsquo; psychoactive compound. &ldquo;A few years ago, WADA, through studies and their scientists, determined someone who has low levels of THC in their system is neither getting a performance enhancing benefit nor is there really a health and safety aspect unless those levels get really high,&rdquo; explains Novitzky. &ldquo;So, they took their threshold from 15 nanograms per milliliter and upped it to 150 so now it must exceed <br />150 ng/ml of THC in order to trigger a positive test.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UNDER PRESSURE&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Many attribute WADA&rsquo;s change in CBD policy to pressure from athletes. The most prominent being UFC fighter Nate Diaz who vaped from a CBD pen during a post-fight press conference on August 20, 2016.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My speculation is that probably most of the pressure did come from athletes who were starting to make these very overt associations with cannabis use. Like that boxer who smoked his CBD pen with kind of reckless abandon,&rdquo; explains professional cyclist Teal Stetson-Lee, who is an athlete ambassador for Kynd Cannabis Company. &ldquo;And I would throw myself into the mix, too, by just making the statement that I believe in this (CBD) and I am going to partner with a cannabis company even though it's technically illegal in my sport. I will play by your rules, but I am not going to stand by on the sidelines. I think there are more athletes who are starting to do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stetson-Lee thinks Diaz&rsquo;s actions helped kick off some of the dialogue, but she is interested in how it translated so rapidly into policy change. &ldquo;I was surprised that it happened to quickly because there has been such pushback from governing authorities for the most part when it comes to cannabis as a substance for athletes to make use of. I think I was anticipating there would be some deeper, longer conversations that would have to happen before there was some receptivity,&rdquo; says Stetson-Lee, 31, who uses CBD topicals and tinctures. &ldquo;The thing about CBD is that it&rsquo;s relatively easy for people to get behind once you start talking about the benefits of it and how it effects your body and, most importantly, that it doesn&rsquo;t have any psychoactive effects to it. It&rsquo;s the psychoactive part, the THC piece, that seems to have people all freaked out. That seems to be what makes everyone the most nervous and everyone has their panties in a bunch about.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>UFC fighter Gina Mazany, 29, has a theory of her own as to why WADA lifted the CBD ban. &ldquo;I feel like it&rsquo;s a conspiracy theory. There are so many ways that CBD can benefit everyone in one way or another, but if people are using a product that they aren&rsquo;t going to make money off of then they are not going to allow it, or make it seem like an evil thing,&rdquo; says Mazany, who uses a 1:1 ratio CBD/THC vape pen that helps her with anxiety and sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it got lifted because the beneficial information about CBD began to surface especially in the MMA world. Because of what we put our bodies through, it&rsquo;s not normal and it&rsquo;s ideally not healthy. So why can&rsquo;t we have this extra something to help us recover and stay healthy and keep the brain damage in line. I am not surprised, I am actually surprised it hasn&rsquo;t been sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Former NFL player Kyle Turley, 42, was surprised WADA didn&rsquo;t go further. &ldquo;With so many athletes advocating for cannabis period, not just CBD, the FDA/DEA are just falling in line with what the government is saying. The DEA has even said on their Twitter account and websites that CBD is not like marijuana.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turley continues, &ldquo;Everybody&rsquo;s tune is changing. I was just in DC a couple of weeks ago doing some lobbying and all these guys are saying: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I am for. I am for the Charlotte&rsquo;s Web thing and the whole CBD deal.&rsquo; So, okay, you are for guys who like to take pictures of themselves in skinny jeans in Colorado. Well this is about marijuana and this is about this plant and that is the base level, tip of the iceberg to what is capable in this plant, period. It doesn&rsquo;t surprise me, it&rsquo;s par for the course as to what I have seen thanks to the advocacy of so many great Americans over these years.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>IS THE NFL OUT IN THE COLD?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Of everything I am seeing and hearing anecdotally there seems to be great advantages to professional athletes in sports like ours. I could foresee it for football players, too, who are constantly getting nicks and dings on their body, having swelling and in pain, being able to benefit from it,&rdquo; notes UFC&rsquo;s Novitzky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in spite of the benefits and lifting the ban this month, Turley is not so sure his NFL brethren will have the chance to use CBD anytime soon. &ldquo;They (NFL) will fall in line with the federal government. They won&rsquo;t follow WADA. The NFL is its own deal and it runs as the government runs, as their track record has spoken to. I think that when the government finally comes out and says that CBD is okay then I think the NFL will come out officially for it,&rdquo; says Turley, who launched a cannabis neuroprotectant line called Neuro Armour last fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turley is correct in his assertion. The NFL does not plan to follow WADA&rsquo;s CBD recommendation. According to a NFL spokesperson, &ldquo;The NFL and NFL Players Association have comprehensive programs and policies addressing both PEDs as well as illegal drugs and substances of abuse. In that respect, we rely on independent medical advisors who regularly review the most current research and scientific data, and there is more to learn about cannabinoid compounds as they may relate to their potential treatment of acute and chronic pain. This is an area of research we are looking to develop further, along with the NFLPA, to determine whether those substances could be used as an effective and safe pain-management tool for players. Currently, however, our advisors have not recommended making a change or revisiting our collectively-bargained policy and approach related to marijuana and cannabinoids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Crowley, who invented the Trokie, a medicinal cannabis lozenge, isn&rsquo;t sure why the NFL hasn&rsquo;t seen the light. &ldquo;The NFL is taking great hits at realizing this sport may disappear in 10 or 15 years and that&rsquo;s a multi-billion-dollar industry,&rdquo; says Dr. Crowley, who lays most of the fault at the feet of the federal government. &ldquo;I wish that these wealthy athletes would all put together a class action suit against the freakin&rsquo; federal government that, in essence, says: You are not only preventing my ability to protect myself against a sport that has demonstrated clear damage to my health, but you are preventing me from accessing an adaptogenetic herb that was used for 70 years and one of the top three prescriptions that were issued in the United States from 1850 to the 1930s. It&rsquo;s recognized as a pharmaceutical in over 26 countries around the world. Why are you preventing us from access to something that has a broad therapeutic index, minimal toxicity, if at all, to help me protect myself from trauma in my profession?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>LET</strong><strong>&rsquo;S CALL IT </strong><strong>INJURED PRESERVE&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>CBD offers many valuable benefits for athletes including faster muscle recovery post-workout, aid in relieving pre-competition anxiety, help with sleep, and it acts as a neuroprotectant. But its biggest potential benefit will be in helping athletes heal from their injuries and get back in competition more quickly.</p>
<p>Stetson-Lee cites topicals as the most effective for her post-recovery training as a professional mountain biker and cyclocross racer. She started using Kynd Cannabis Company&rsquo;s CBD tincture and salve post-workout to &ldquo;recover and heal quicker, stay fresher, and help my body relax more so I sleep better, which is huge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>UFC fighter Mazany uses CBD for anxiety citing its main benefit as &ldquo;knowing I am dealing with medical issues without using a chemically processed substitute. I don&rsquo;t have to take a Xanax or I have depression and I don&rsquo;t have to take Prozac. I used to take Prozac and it made me numb to everything. To each their own, and whatever people want to take that&rsquo;s their prerogative, but I noticed once I started using CBD it helped a lot with that. I still get anxiety thinking about my fights, and it helps me to sleep and calm down.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for injuries, both Stetson-Lee and Mazany believe not being able to use CBD was a missed opportunity. Stetson-Lee didn&rsquo;t know about CBD when she had one of her most serious crashes in 2012 which resulted in a mangled face and severe concussion. &ldquo;It would have been amazing to have those products at that time. All the studies being done right now as far as CBD and brain trauma is pretty astounding. That would be my first go-to and my first recommendation for anybody who has any kind of head trauma,&rdquo; explains Stetson-Lee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mazany also wishes she could have used CBD during her most recent fight to help with an injury she sustained in practice. &ldquo;Before my last fight, I broke my foot five weeks out. It was a good opportunity for me and a good fight for me, so I didn&rsquo;t want to miss it. One of the things I really wanted to include in my healing was CBD. I was doing everything from drinking bone broth to laser treatment. One of the options was putting a CBD ointment on it and it&rsquo;s sad I wasn&rsquo;t able to use that. Everything went fine, I won my fight and I was happy but it&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s not performance enhancing, it&rsquo;s just beneficial for athletes in prolonging our careers,&rdquo; Mazany points out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also benefits for athletes after their careers have ended. &ldquo;CBD has played an important role in allowing me to personally manage pain, cope with CTE-like symptoms, improve my overall health and eliminate the need for prescription opioids that nearly cost me my life due to long-term use side effects,&rdquo; explains Turley, who played five seasons for the New Orleans Saints, a year with the St. Louis Rams and for two years with the Kansas City Chiefs before retiring in 2007.</p>
<p><strong>THE CONVERSATION IS FAR FROM OVER</strong></p>
<p>Yet, all the athletes in this story will tell you the cannabis conversation is far from over. Research has shown CBD is most effective in an entourage effect which would include THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis. &ldquo;It still is a little complicated because the most effective CBD products are paired with THC and that&rsquo;s really important to consider,&rdquo; imparts Stetson-Lee. &ldquo;Pure CBD generally doesn&rsquo;t have the same effectiveness because the THC, and I am by no means a chemist, is fat soluble. It penetrates better and is the catalyst for allowing CBD to then penetrate the body&rsquo;s cannabinoid receptors. So, in that respect it&rsquo;s still going to be tricky. Just because CBD is no longer on the banned substance list that doesn&rsquo;t necessarily open the floodgates for full cannabis use. Only 100 percent CBD products can be used and that that&rsquo;s not necessarily the whole solution. If THC is still something people are squeamish about, then the conversation is far from over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turley thinks that&rsquo;s why the NFL has been mum on the subject. &ldquo;Personally, I think more football players are calling for full legalization, full implementation of this plant because CBD is the tip of the iceberg and in football you are dealing with everyday accounts of serious injury and the need to get back on the field to compete fast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Athletes in this discussion on the football side are pressing more for total legalization, more than the other sports who are just saying give us CBD. Football athletes are saying we need more than that. CBD is a tremendous benefit but with THC included it's supercharged and you need that in dealing with sports like football,&rdquo; says Turley.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Total legalization for athletes may not be as far away as Turley thinks. &ldquo;I know Nevada (Nevada Athletic Commission) had talked last January about considering not just taking CBD off the prohibited list, but also taking THC and marijuana off as well,&rdquo; says Novitzky. &ldquo;I initially had some concerns about the health and safety issues. You would not want someone walking into the Octagon high on marijuana. But the argument I got on the other side from them was you wouldn&rsquo;t want someone walking into the Octagon drunk but we aren&rsquo;t testing for traces of alcohol in their system. We could see that happening before too long,&rdquo; he says of a full legalization for athletes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A NEW DAY&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Even though lifting the ban on CBD is progress and by all accounts will be beneficial to athletes, it&rsquo;s still a situation with many caveats. &ldquo;Anecdotally, I can&rsquo;t argue with all of the benefits of CBD being available to athletes but because of the lack of any legitimate trials and because of the legal status of CBD right now I tend to stay away from making any recommendations,&rdquo; offers Novitzky. &ldquo;But on a personal level, notwithstanding the lack of clinical trials, at least anecdotally, my feelings are it&rsquo;s a lot helluva better alternative than using synthetically made drugs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stetson-Lee also finds plenty to be optimistic about. &ldquo;It will definitely create some interest in that direction because the sport&rsquo;s governing body is now opening that door. People will be able to talk about it and feel like it&rsquo;s a little less taboo,&rdquo; she says of CBD. &ldquo;Athletes will be passing products back and forth amongst their peers and recommending different CBD products that they are using for muscle relaxation or reducing pain and it won&rsquo;t be quite so hush-hush. So that is a positive and I definitely have to celebrate that.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turley is more cynical on the subject and still sees full legal utilization for NFL athletes as far off. &ldquo;It is about this plant and making it free and this is the opportunity. Unfortunately, it has to come at the image of capitalism and that&rsquo;s all that our government understands. As this industry grows and they see the projected $700-billion industry rise over the next five years that&rsquo;s when things will actually change,&rdquo; he surmises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Crowley is also less celebratory than Novitzky and Stetson-Lee, boiling it down to the practical application of science. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s criminal that our government continues to ignore the National Academy of Sciences report on unequivocal evidence supporting its use on at least three different conditions, medically, which already discount the claim that schedule 1 status indicates that there is no medically recognized value. Someone is going to have to come to clean here at some point.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded>

<div class="panel-body">
 I had a type of migraine headache that was intractable, it’s called a hemiplegic migraine. Conventional migraine medications don’t work particularly well with it and there’s an increased risk of stroke if you use those medications. Somebody suggested that I try cannabis. I hadn’t used it since college and I tried it and reduced the frequency of the headaches dramatically. I decided to learn more about it and I couldn’t. I would go to dispensaries and ask questions around 2004 and 2005 and nobody knew anything about it and my background had been doing a lot of research for movie projects so I just kind of dove into it. I got more and more into it and was just fascinated that there was all this research about cannabis and the endocannabinoid system with which it interacts, but it hadn’t really percolated down to the medical cannabis consumer.

<div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Yes, I ended up getting more and more obsessed with it and ended up opening a dispensary in 2007. It was called Cornerstone Research Collective and it was the first dispensary with an evidence-based approach. It became really popular in Los Angeles so much so that we closed the membership and went to an interview process for members because it just got to be too much. I left it about six years ago and went off to do research on cannabis breeding. It’s still around, it’s in Los Angeles and thriving.

How do you prefer to ingest cannabis?

<div id="collapseThree" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Primarily through vaping. The problem with edibles is they are effectively a different drug. The rule of thumb is the effects are twice as strong and it will last twice as long. So, it takes a little bit of fine tuning to get the same kind of effects from orally consumed cannabis as when you inhale it and are just getting Delta 9-THC. While I learned how to use edibles effectively, it’s a different approach. When you swallow THC your liver turns it into 11-Hydroxy-THC, which is effectively a different drug.

What have you learned about vaping? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFour" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

The thing that has kept me in the cannabis business is there is just so little high-quality information for users of cannabis whether they are using medicinally or recreationally. With vaping, for example, the compounds come off the vaporized cannabis at different rates. So, when you are first vaporizing cannabis you are primarily getting the essential oils or terpenes, and because cannabinoids, when they are vaporized have no taste, people think when the floral taste of the vapor declines they are no longer getting cannabinoids but they are wrong. What happens is people have a tendency to not vape enough. Vaping can be incredibly efficient in delivering cannabinoids, you just have to understand how vaporization works. It will often take three or four or five inhalations off a single vapor load to get the complete effects of what you are using. Vape pens are totally different, they work with concentrates and don’t have that problem because they are so hot that they are delivering everything at once. Even when you are talking about vaporizing you are talking about two different approaches. The classic vaporization of cannabis flowers or these new vape pens, and they are different in how they deliver the cannabinoids and terpenes, so there’s a lot to learn.

Why did you write “Cannabis Pharmacy”?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFive" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I wanted a book that had all the information that I had been seeking. It was more of a collation process but also it was an opportunity to really dig deep into the topic. It is a very, very broad subject -- you have the botanical aspects, the chemical aspects, you have the pharmacological aspects, the social aspects, there is just a lot going on with cannabis and it’s use. It’s not a simple subject, which is one of the reasons there wasn’t a book like mine out there when I wrote it in 2014.

What was the hardest part about writing “Cannabis Pharmacy”? 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSix" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Getting legitimate information about the chemistry, there’s a lot of nonsense out there. You go in the average dispensary and you ask them to describe what they carry, and they say we have indicas, sativas and hybrids, and the indicas have more CBD in it and that’s all complete nonsense. You can’t distinguish cannabis by indica and sativa.The reality among plant taxonomists these days is that sativas refer strictly to hemp plants that only produce CBD and indicas refer to plants that produce only THC for the most part. But you don’t get that information at the dispensaries. Dispensaries have it completely backwards, the truth is the sativas that produce a lot of CBD are sold not as sativas but as CBD plants by the dispensaries so it’s kind of a mess. You have to walk into a dispensary and figure out what they have got and how it might be useful to you and that was the hardest part of the book. To actually get some testing done on these varieties and figure out what their terpene composition was and their cannabinoid composition, so people could get more consistent results.

Terpenes are becoming an increasingly more important part of the cannabis plant. 
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeven" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

The terpene thing is kind of overstated. I think with terpenes there is no question that they subtlety effect the psycho-activity and medicinal effects of cannabis varieties when inhaled. When you swallow them it’s very hard to get those terpenes through to the bloodstream. Your body actually is designed to disarm what are often considered by the body as plant toxins. Your body has basically evolved defense mechanisms against them because the plants develop them to control insect nervous systems. When you swallow them they don’t affect you, when you inhale them they get around that system. Terpenes work primarily through inhalation and they subtlety modify the effects of cannabinoids and they have some effects on their own. 
For example, myrcene, which is the most common of the terpenes produced by cannabis, interacts with the opioid receptor which is one of the reasons its more analgesic. Some of the more recent research on myrcene seems to indicate that it is biphasic which means it does two different things at two different dose ranges. And what’s interesting about that is myrcene has a reputation for being more sedative but that’s at high doses, at lower doses it tends to focus you and not be sedating and stimulating. That’s interesting because that’s the truth with most cannabinoids as well. For example, THC at low doses reduces anxiety but at high doses can cause anxiety. So, understanding the biphasic nature of cannabis is really important because cannabis is used to exhibiting different effects at different dose ranges. Let’s say you want to use it for something like ADHD, the dose is going to be really, really small. For appetite stimulation the dose is also going to be really, really small. Understanding the dose is really going to affect the outcome that will enable you to use the plant with a lot more precision.

</div>
<div id="collapseEight" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

Oh, for sure, in just the amount of quality products that are available. The information about the products is also a little better. The quality of the products has really increased dramatically over the last few years and that is completely due to more analytical testing of the crop. A lot of growers get their stuff tested now and are better able to understand it. The quality of the laboratory testing out there varies somewhat but its improved dramatically as well over the last couple of years. You will also see the changes in things like the Emerald Cup, which just completed in Northern California and is kind of the Oscars of Weed. It’s fascinating because the quality of these products we are testing has really dramatically increased. For a long time, it was just about potency and how strong you can make something. Now the effects are getting more subtle. Now people are saying, “Oh, wow, so this combination of cannabinoids with this combination of terpenes gives you this result.” Now you are seeing more interesting cannabis show up rather than just stronger cannabis, which is, I think, super encouraging and that’s changed since the first edition of the book.

Has research become more plentiful?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseNine" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

There has been a huge explosion of research in the last three or four years and my understanding of it has increased so I can better translate it to the average consumer. It’s a very complex topic, so it’s taken me a long time to get deeper and deeper into it, so I can try and translate that for the average consumer. It went from several hundred papers a year on the topic to several thousand. There’s research being conducted all over the globe and a lot of it is high quality research from countries like Hungary, Switzerland, Israel, England, the Netherlands, US, and increasingly in China. Even countries like Iran have really good research programs to look at the plant and what it is producing and its effects so there was a lot of material to go through to produce the second edition which made it tough to keep the book from expanding only 50 pages. I had to really tighten stuff up in order to incorporate all the material. It’s frustrating because the second you lock the book down, you will get that new paper and wish you could include it. I’m already collecting stuff for the third edition. But I think the second edition is the book I really wanted to write. It gives me a much better picture of how to use the plant, both medicinally and recreationally. 
I think the distinction between medical and recreational use of cannabis is a little bit artificial. I find a lot of people who use it recreationally are, in fact, using it to reduce what you would normally call symptoms like they are slightly anxious, etc. I find some medical users really begin to enjoy it. So, it’s this interesting balance you have to strike between the two definitions because I don’t think they are that firm.

Do you think CBD will eventually be taken as a preventative medicine?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseTen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

I think there is no question that low dose CBD is really interesting. CBD is phenomenally complex in its activity, it’s not just targeting one receptor. Its targeting over a dozen and ion channels on top of that. It works broadly throughout the body and our understanding of its mechanism of action I think is going to continue to evolve over several years. It’s a reason to be slightly cautious with CBD just because it doesn’t exhibit any psycho-activity, doesn’t mean it’s not a powerful substance and it needs to be respected. I think my recommendation on any cannabis use, is use just enough to get the affects you are looking for and no more. In the case of CBD where you aren’t going to have psycho-activity as a benchmark for effect, then just err on the side of caution and use a little less to address whatever you are trying to address whether its social anxiety or whatever.

It’s kind of in process. There are certainly a lot of people who want to research it. While NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse) has said we want to study this more, and fund research for CBD and encourage University of Mississippi to grow more CBD plants under the monopolistic contract that they have with the government to provide research cannabis in the US, it’s still a work in progress and I think the laws need to change. As long as it remains a schedule 1 substance, the barriers to research remain formidable. As long as you have only one contracted producer of cannabis, the supply is limited because there are a lot of varieties of cannabis out there. While University of Mississippi has tried over the last few years to provide a wider range of cannabis, it doesn’t really reflect the complete range of cannabis available to consumers, you have to study what people are taking, you can’t just study what you have got. I want to see research increase in the US. I think it’s kind of backwards right now in comparison to a county like Israel. Even though we have a lot more cannabis here and more interesting cannabis than they have in Israel, it’s hard to study it.

No, cause it’s not performance enhancing its performance enabling.

</a></h4>

<div id="collapseThirteen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

That’s complete nonsense. Your body doesn’t produce anything like CBD. Your body produces endocannabinoids. Typically, what happens is you have hemp-derived or cannabis-derived CBD but it comes with a tiny bit of THC and that is easily detected by the exquisite sensitivity of the instruments they use for drug testing these days. So, what happens is take CBD that has a little bit of THC in it and they will test positive. If they have access to absolutely pure CBD they will not test positive. 
There was a scare and a big controversy in the last 18 months in the cannabis research community. Some people did an experiment that it really wasn’t that hard to cycle CBD to THC under acidic conditions that are found in the stomach. So, the concern was if you are taking a lot of CBD orally, your stomach acid was converting a small amount of it to THC. Some people say that’s absolute nonsense. And other people say, “No, we have the evidence.” So, I have a tendency to align with the side that says CBD is not being converted to THC in the body. But I do know that when Raphael Mechoulam, who discovered THC, makes THC from CBD. He cycles it with an acidic solution from CBD to THC. It’s not really tough chemistry which is interesting for these states that have just legalized CBD, thinking they are protecting their populace from the evils of THC when, in fact, with some pool supply chemicals and a hot plate in your garage you could probably convert any CBD product to pure THC.

What are some emerging trends you foresee for cannabis?
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseFourteen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

More consistent information about the effects that are caused by different variations of cannabis and different formulations that use cannabis. I think you are going to get more predictable effects and a wider range of effects. I think we are really starting to understand how cannabis works. Eventually an informed consumer will be able to go into a shop and know what chemistry works best for what they are looking for and be able to get it. The problem with cannabis over the last 50 years in the US has been that it was all grown for potency and that was because of Prohibition. Just like beer disappeared during alcohol prohibition and was replaced by hard spirits because concentrated forms of alcohol were easier to conceal. The exact same thing happened to cannabis where it became how strong can you make it. That means I can carry the most amount of THC in the smallest space. So, concentrates became popular. Super-strong, high THC cannabis 
became dominant. Cannabis went from being around two or three percent THC to varieties that have almost 30 percent today. That’s an extraordinary increase by a single compound in a plant. That just shows you how assiduous breeders were in approaching this task of making this plant flower faster, grow smaller, and be more potent and that’s what happened over the last 50 years. Now you are going to see that roll back and that’s actually going to increase the range of effects available from the plants. Dropping this obsession with potency and starting to go for an obsession with quality, I think that’s the big trend. 
I had a discussion with really prominent Northern California cultivators who have been doing this for half a century and asked why they don’t grow the tall sativa style plants anymore as they had a better effect. Back in the day they used to distinguish between the high of marijuana versus the stoned of marijuana and these narrow leaf varieties that we came to call sativas produced a high, and these broad leaf varieties that we brought in from Afghanistan that flowered quickly and had short squat plants -- those were indicas and they were more sedating. So, I said, “Why did you a grow a plant that has a dulling effect?” They said, “Because they come out of the ground faster, they produce more, and the THC content is higher.” So, it was literally just the economics of everybody chasing THC, and they found the plant that produced the most, as quickly as possible, and that became the driving force behind marijuana breeding for half a century. It’s a classic economic pressure, you want to make a product that’s valuable and you want to stay out of jail. Those were the driving forces behind super high potency cannabis products.

<div id="collapseFifteen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It really does the consumer a disservice because it encourages the consumer to use what they can withstand rather than what they need. Really that’s what it is. It’s a little bit fascist to me in the sense that it’s one of these things where you have to learn how to handle your high. I find that absurd. A lot of people are looking for a glass of wine effect in cannabis, not a half of bottle of Tequila effect. After you get out of school you usually don’t have the luxury of being able to recover or commit to super intense psycho-activity whether it’s with half a bottle of tequila or a couple of joints with 30 percent THC weed. A lot of people have really dysphoric reactions.

How important is education to the novice cannabis user?

</div>
<div id="collapseSixteen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

It’s a really interesting thing about cannabis. Cannabis has a really tough time retaining consumers. Over 100 million people have tried cannabis in the US and only 20 million people still use it. While with alcohol nearly 60 percent of the people who tried it continue to use it. 
I have stood at dispensary counters and had novice cannabis patients come in and have somebody behind the counter say, “Oh, yeah, you should try this edible. It’s 50 mg.” While the average cannabis-naïve patient will have a dysphoric unpleasant reaction with 15 milligrams of THC, you will have these nuts recommend something three or four times stronger to a cannabis-naïve patient. Are you going to keep that patient around? No, they will try it once and it will scare the hell out of them and they won’t use it again. A lot of people have exited cannabis as a drug of choice because they had a bad reaction from taking too much. Dose control, if you control the dose you can have a great time. Even if you have had a bad time in the past, just reduce your dose dramatically.

What’s the best way to control dosing?  
</a></h4>
</div>
<div id="collapseSeventeen" class="panel-collapse collapse">
<div class="panel-body">

You have to take control of the consistency of the extract you are using to make that work because there’s no reasonable or handheld device that’s going to be able to handle different potencies and have extracts and flower deliver the same consistent dose. That is not on the horizon. It will be some kind of metered vape pen. But the problem is what goes into those vape pens really doesn’t represent the flower that well. You lose a lot of stuff during extraction. If you manage to extract it, it’s tough to keep it around. A lot of these extracts are ridiculously perishable although almost none of them are sold as perishable. You buy a vape pen, you don’t know when it was made or how much of its chemistry has changed since extraction. I guarantee you it does not resemble the flower from which it was extracted from a chemistry standpoint. There’s a lot of nonsense out there and people are not forthcoming about this -- about how close to a flower effect these vape pens can deliver. Certain terpenes like myrcene are super super fragile and within 40 days a lot of myrcene will have degraded if you extract it, it makes it even more vulnerable though oxidation and breakdown. I recommend that when people buy extractions that have been frozen since manufacture that they are kept frozen until you use them. The idea that you can walk around with a room temperature product for weeks or a month and not have it change is naïve.

How important is CBD’s role in using cannabis?

The biggest discovery I have made in the last couple of years is the importance of CBD to buffer THC. Transform, which is the drug policy research group think tank in the UK, did a report recently on legalization of cannabis in the UK and they recommended mandating a CBD buffer. I look at CBD as the seatbelt for cannabis use. It doesn’t mean you can’t drive really fast, it just means if you have a problem you have some protection. I think CBD provides that protection. I am not trying to ban your sportscar, I’m just trying to keep you from getting killed in it. I don’t think THC is going to kill you, but I definitely think we have all met people who have that thousand-yard stare that I think is a kind of uncharacterized neurological deficit caused by taking too much THC for too long. You talk to somebody who has been smoking 20 joints a day for 30 years and it’s like they are on tape delay. If taking a little CBD prevents that, that’s a big deal.

What has been the most fascinating cannabis discovery for you?  
</a></h4>

Biphasic dosing is the most interesting thing in cannabis right now. The idea that you can change your dose to get two different effects with the exact same chemistry. It’s going to change how I use cannabis and I think it’s going to change how other people use cannabis. I think it’s the future of this. If I want to get the munchies, I’m going to use a small dose. If I want to treat nausea, I’m going to have to use a high dose. Or somebody wants to treat social anxiety and take a small amount of THC, buffering it with a little bit of CBD. I think that’s going to trickle down to adult-use recreational scenarios as well. 
That leads to the second biggest discovery I have made, which is how CBD can protect the brain from the adverse effects of THC, which has been shown pretty conclusively now in at least four brain scan studies conducted in the UK, US and Australia. What they found was that THC by itself consistently effects the hippocampus part of the brain, that’s imminently linked to memory and learning. If you use CBD at the same time as THC, even if you use THC chronically, you protect the brain, specifically the hippocampus from those changes, and that’s a really big deal. Because what it’s saying is that THC should be buffered with CBD just like it is in nature. For the most part, most large drug crops of cannabis produce equal amounts of CBD and THC when you grow cannabis in a field. During prohibition particular plants were selected for their THC content and they accidently bred out CBD. But it may well be that our coevolution with this plant required that both cannabinoids be used together, and I think there is increasing evidence to support that.
